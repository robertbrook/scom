<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney, South and Shore-ditch)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the amendment aims to establish investor confidence, public confidence and parliamentary confidence in the self-regulating system. That is why we want a substantial number of independent members in self-regulating organisations.<br><br>
As I drove in from glorious Hackney to Westminster this morning, I was thinking how little public confidence this country has in SROs at present. Even in Italy, the Mafia goes on trial, but what happens in this country to Sir Peter Green, Peter Cameron-Webb, Peter Dixon and John Walrock? One of them is in a sauna bath in the Mandarin hotel in Hong Kong; another is in Long Island, New York; yet another is on a sun-kissed island in the southern hemisphere; and Sir Peter Green is in charge of the pictures at Lloyd's. That is rather like Sir Anthony Blunt, the traitor, who was in charge of the Queen's pictures.<br><br>
SROs will experience extreme difficulties unless they have independent chairmen. I do not want to go into the background of Sir Peter Green—indeed, it would take weeks to do so—but I simply wish to make a few comments about what happened at Lloyd's to help the Committee to decide whether to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will, but I have only just started.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek to help the hon. Gentleman as he unfolds the saga of Lloyd's, which he has already done on a number of occasions.<br><br>
Before the hon. Gentleman assumes that an SRO cannot be successful, unless it has what he chooses to call an independent chairman, perhaps he will recall that, at our last sitting, I drew the Committee's attention to the success of the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Since its formation under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977, that council has had a distinguished chairman from within the insurance broking profession. Presumably the hon. Gentleman will take that into account in reaching his conclusions about the desirability of an independent chairman from outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember exactly what the hon. Gentleman said, and stored it up in case you, Sir Michael, ruled me out of order. That was a good example, but we cannot take one case and say that it will make good law. Public confidence will not be enhanced if SROs have insiders. Indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
that is a worry because the insider establishes cosy relationships. That is precisely what happened at Lloyd's, in distinct contrast to what happened in the insurance market, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.<br><br>
No one in this room would argue that Sir Peter Green, a former chairman of Lloyd's, would pass the test of " honest, competent and solvent", or would be a " fit and proper person", to register as an investor, still less to act as chairman of an SRO. If a chairman becomes dishonest, what happens if he is not independent? We have real problems about getting rid of him, but, if he is independent, he cannot become dishonest in the sphere in which he operates. There is no question of him getting his fingers in the pie. But if we get a dishonest chairman like Sir Peter Green, the Establishment will seek to use a series of curious back-door stratagems to get rid of that chairman.<br><br>
Sir Kenneth Berrill, who will head the SIB, will find himself in almost the same position as that in which the Governor of the Bank of England found himself in the case of Sir Peter Green. Instead of being able to say, " Here is an independent chairman so we haven't got a problem ", the Establishment had to say, " Here's a chairman. We believe that he's dishonest. How do we get rid of him? " Sir Peter Green went to the Bank of England to see Sir Gordon Richardson, the then Governor, in the presence of Henry Benson, a member of the Ros-kill committee, and they said to him, " You have a tax problem. Why don't you get out? We don't really want you around."<br><br>
That was entirely unsatisfactory, just as it would be if Sir Kenneth Berrill had to go to chairmen who had been found to be dishonest and instead of getting rid of them and exposing their dishonesty he had to cover it up with such back-door activity. We all know what happened to Sir Peter Green the following year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael, does the Standing Order relating to tedious repetition apply to proceedings in this Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Had there been anything out of order, that would have been a matter for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is getting so edgy and uppity, because this will be a real test of whether we are determined to tackle fraud and whether the hon. Gentleman is prepared to vote for the sort of activity that has gone on in Lloyd's or whether he wants the Bill to make a new start, which means independent chairmen. Perhaps the acid test for the hon. Gentleman will be where he puts his vote and not where his mouth is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman has just tried to disrupt the proceedings. I believe that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
he is trying to filibuster. It is no wonder that there is to be a sittings motion next week.<br><br>
I was saying that in the following year Robin Leigh-Pemberton came along and said, " You really must go." Eventually Sir Peter Green went.<br><br>
That is not the way to run SROs. We do not want to put Sir Kenneth Berrill in the same position as we have put two Governors of the Bank of England in the case of Sir Peter Green, because he was the head of the most prestigious SRO in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great care to the hon. Gentleman's explanation of the situation. He makes a powerful case for the chairman of SROs to be independent and capable of being removed reasonably swiftly. But does not that argue in favour of my amendment, and not in favour of the amendment to which the hon. Gentleman has put his name? The chairmen of SROs should be appointed by the Secretary of State and capable of removal by him, and therefore accountable to the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have enormous sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's amendment. It is entirely up to you, Sir Michael, whether or not we vote on the hon. Gentleman's amendment. It is better drafted than the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who is now attending the sitting of the Building Societies Bill and cannot speak to his amendment himself.<br><br>
I admire the phraseology of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). The amendment to which I have added my name was drawn up by the National Consumer Council, which does not have the experience of the hon. Member for Yeovil in such matters.<br><br>
If we do not have independent chairmen and they are discovered to be dishonest, there will be a tendency to try to produce an amnesty. That is what has happened in Lloyd's.<br><br>
Although Sir Peter Green admitted to his crimes by publishing documents, he has effectively been given an amnesty. I want to be fair to Lloyd's; Lloyd's would deny that. I was at the City forum the other day and was taking about Lloyd's. Lloyd's said that Peter Miller, the present chairman, had gone to the previous meeting and had promised that there would not be an amnesty for anyone; the discussion was aimed at Sir Peter Green. But it seems that there has been an amnesty and that is not a suitable course of action in a parliamentary democracy. We should not pass a Bill containing a clause that would encourage giving an amnesty to chairmen who were found to be dishonest.<br><br>
I am about to make my last reference to Sir Peter Green, which may bring some relief to Conservative Members. If chairmen become dishonest, which would not happen if the amendment were accepted, extraordinary difficulties can arise when incidents are being investigated.<br><br>
I do not want to go into details of any of the incidents but most people know that Sir Peter Green set up an inquiry to find out whether there was any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
dishonesty in a firm called Unimar, a Monte Carlo slush fund. Some of his friends were involved, and he said that there had been no dishonesty. There was uproar at Lloyd's and it was said that the report did not fit the facts. Sir Peter Green agreed to appoint a QC, Mr S. Tuckey, to inquire into whether he had acted properly. Mr Tuckey came up with the conclusion that the chairman could not be criticised, because he had asked all the right questions, and he decided that there was no dishonesty at Unimar.<br><br>
That was wrong, as everyone knows—particularly the Minister, whose Department is conducting an inquiry. The Department has discovered dishonesty at Unimar, and no doubt the Minister when he replies to the debate will tell us when that report is to be published.<br><br>
Only a week ago I was given a confidential document which shows that the QC who conducted the inquiry into Sir Peter Green, the chairman,—but not an independent chairman—had real evidence of dishonesty at Unimar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going into great detail on a certain case. We are not discussing that case, but an amendment. The hon. Gentleman was developing an argument on the amendment, but he is now going into very great detail on other cases and that is not within the ambit of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I crave your indulgence, Sir Michael. I am trying to draw an analogy between the labyrinthine complexities of these cases.<br><br>
If the chairman is dishonest,—which would not be possible under the amendment,—and a QC investigates the chairman, and says that everything is all right, when evidence comes forward to show that everything is not all right, society starts to ask all sorts of questions. We do not want people to ask, " What did the QC do with the information? Did he report it to the DPP? Did he report it to the Department of Trade and Industry? Did he report it to the council at Lloyd's? " It is to avoid those questions being asked that I believe an independent chairman to be essential.<br><br>
We have also argued in this debate that there is a powerful case for more independent members of the SROs. It is possible for a number of members of an SRO to become involved in questionable practices.<br><br>
At Lloyd's the practice of baby or preferred syndicates came up. Conservative Members constantly say that Lloyd's did nothing wrong after the passing of the 1982 Act. That is not true, and anyone who believes it does not know the facts. The baby syndicates were not stopped in 1982, 1983 or 1984. It was only in December 1985 that Lloyd's drew up rules—probably because a number of council members were involved in baby and preferred syndicates. They did not have the independence that we want under the Bill. That is a good argument not only for the Lloyd's body but also for other SROs.<br><br>
Independent members will not quail, they will not worry about political embarrassment or whether they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
are embarrassing Ministers or Governments. When they report, a strong independent element will ensure that the reports get published quickly, which is important in a democracy.<br><br>
I said yesterday in the House of Commons that one reason why the Bellew Parry Raven report, which was drawn up by Sir Edward Singleton, has been on the desk of Lloyd's for some time without being published is that there is not a strong enough independent element at Lloyd's to get it published. Members of the Committee know the composition of Lloyd's—16 working members, eight non-working members and three independent members, one of whom is, I believe, Sir Kenneth Berrill. There is not a strong enough independent element at Lloyd's to ensure that reports are published.<br><br>
Lloyd's may not have published the Bellew Parry Raven report because much of it deals with Mr. Ted Nelson, who was a member of the council for four years. Thus there is non-reporting of labryn-thine and complex details in inquiries and an inability to deal with the chairman of an SRO.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
There is an extraordinarily powerful case for accepting the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby or, preferably, the amendment of the hon. Member for Yeovil.<br><br>
Many people in the City do not like what the Committee is doing, as I read in <i>The Observer</i> last Sunday. One of them is Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, the stockbroker to the Queen who works at Rowe and Pitman, the brokers who held nominee shares for three undisclosed shareholders at Westland. But that is irrelevant. Peter Wilmot-Sitwell is strongly opposed to what we are doing. He says that we are trying to stop him and other brokers abusing contacts with other people—in other words, we are trying to stop insider dealing. He says that we shall put the kibosh on their profits.<br><br>
We want independent members who can tell Mr. Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, "We are not prepared to go along with your kind of attitude. We have a different opinion from the Queen's stockbroker." I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will support the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby and of the hon. Member for Yeovil.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is something in all this, but in discussing the amendments we should consider one or two factors. SROs should be self-regulating, which is the whole purpose of them. We shall confuse the issues and damage the case for giving greater weight to the designated body or SIB if we make SROs statutorily controlled rather voluntarily self-regulating.<br><br>
Whether we like it or not—Opposition Members clearly do not like it—self-regulating means that the organisations must enjoy the respect of the businesses that are members of them and which they will control. It is essential that there should be a majority-control representation of members on any SRO.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
I have often been critical about the lack of lay membership of SROs. The Wilson committee report was excellent, but it was left on the shelf to gather dust. It contained some pertinent observations about the need for lay membership. In recent years some of us have been pressing the Council for the Securities Industry, the stock exchange and other organisations to accept and appoint more independent members on their boards.<br><br>
I said on Second Reading that it was paramount that all such organisations, including the designated body, should recognise their raison d'être, which is first and foremost to protect the interests of investors. Irrespective of whether an organisation is an SRO or the SIB, it is not there to ensure the smooth working of the market. That may be the secondary purpose of such organisations, but their principal and overriding objective must be the protection of investors. Their first criterion in considering any rule change or any form of organisation must be whether it would serve and protect the interests of investors.<br><br>
That is a powerful case, to which we shall return at a later stage in our consideration of the Bill, for toughening up the authority of the SIB. If we are to do that, we must have the proposed structure of a mix of a statutory body in the middle, with self-regulating organisations underneath. I emphasise the case for them being self-regulating; they would therefore be composed largely of members of the businesses concerned.<br><br>
None of the amendments is particularly appealing, although I find amendment No. 70, tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), the most appealing.<br><br>
I object to amendment No. 93 because first, it proposes the appointment of an independent chairman. I do not believe that that would be desirable or workable in terms of respect and authority among the businesses concerned. Second, it proposes that the representatives of people who use the services and members who are unconnected with any particular aspect of the business should together form at least one third of the total membership of the council. I do not believe that any amendment should specify the proportion of lay membership of SROs.<br><br>
My reason for that is rather different from what I have already said; in my view, the different businesses that will be regulated by the SROs may demand different degrees of representations by lay membership. I would argue that there should be a substantial lay membership—although not a majority—on the stock exchange council. However, there is a case for fewer lay members in SROs in an area such as the financial futures markets and the new, more esoteric and sophisticated financial markets in the City. Members of the public are less exposed as individuals to risks in those markets than they are on the stock exchange, where transactions comprise a larger proportion of the turnover.<br><br>
That should not be subject to statutory definition. However, in my view, schedule 2(5) in its present
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
form, which imposes a responsibility on SROs to appoint lay members, does not lay sufficient emphasis on the clear need for a sufficient and representative number of lay members to be appointed.<br><br>
But if they are to be SROs, they must be left as SROs. If they are to be competent organisations with a working knowledge of the businesses that they seek to control—whether it be in terms of balancing accounts or formulating complicated rules for the day-to-day running of such businesses—and if they are to be respected, authoritative and effective in ensuring both investor protection and the good workings of the market, they should comprise a majority of practitioners.<br><br>
I am opposed to some of the other amendments because I believe that it would be a mistake to have members—whether they be the chairman or board members—imposed on the SROs by the Secretary of State or, under designation, by the SIB. It would be dangerous to allow the Governor of the Bank of England, the Secretary of State, or perhaps the chairman of the SIB to have a role in appointing members of SROs.<br><br>
In the structure that I envisage there ought to be no conflict of interest between the SIB and the SROs. The authorities and responsibilities of each body ought to be clearly distinguished.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State were to appoint both the chairman of the SIB and the chairmen of all or one of the SROs, the structure would be a co-ordinated one, which should be part of one body. If the concept of the Bill—or differentiating the SIB, which is to be at arm's length, from the SROs, which are to be involved closely with the businesses—is to work, and the SIB is to maintain and enjoy its authority, they will have to be truly self-regulating, without appointees of the Secretary of State on their boards.<br><br>
My remarks enhance the case for toughening up the role of the SIB. That case would be weakened if we were to turn the SROs into mini SIBs.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has listened to the debate on both sides of the Committee, and that he will consider looking at the question further to ensure that there is a lay membership of the SROs and that investors' interests are protected. However, the drafting and detailed content of some of the amendments should not be accepted.</span></p>

Secondly, in the record of our proceedings on Tuesday 11 February the intervention attributed to me in column 189 was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). While I envy his ready wit, the record should be corrected. The record also shows that I said:
<br><blockquote><p>"which is a concern of the stock exchange council."— <i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 11 February 1986; c. 197.]</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
That is incorrect. I said,
<br><blockquote><p>"on the lines of the SEC".</p></blockquote>
I explained to the <i>Official Report</i> that SEC means the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States of America. Therefore, I hope that the record will be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's points have been noted. I am sorry if there have been mistakes. Doubtless they will be corrected in the final report, although it is unlikely that they can be corrected before that.<br><br>
I am sorry if there are not enough copies of the list of the selection of amendments. I shall try to have it put right as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the considered way in which the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) put his views will carry some weight with the Committee and in particular with the Minister. I do not agree with all his comments, but they should weigh with us in trying to resolve what is a difficult question.<br><br>
In general, I support all the amendments grouped together for the debate. I tabled my amendments, which are more modest than those that were tabled subsequently, to ensure that we had a debate. They are a marker for the general direction that the Bill should take on the matter.<br><br>
I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the limits to which we should take the point and about its relationship with the question of the powers of the SIB. His comments were persuasive.<br><br>
I share the general view expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Hackney, South and Shore-ditch (Mr. Sedgemore) and for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) as well as that of the hon. Members for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and for Stafford (Mr. Cash). The SROs should have an element of outside supervision or at least an outside opinion, while at the same time regulating themselves. That is the common thread in all the amendments in the group.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch was right to cite Lloyd's as an example. It is a prime example of what can go wrong if self-regulation is allowed to continue away from the public gaze and without outside intervention and monitoring. An introspective or even incestuous atmosphere can develop, which should be an object lesson to the Committee and the Minister in what to avoid.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The problem at Lloyd's was not only that there were crooks at the margin, although it is important to deal with them and the Bill must be the means by which they can be brought speedily to justice. The practices that became the vehicles for fraud and theft, such as preferred syndicates, offshore reinsurance arrangements and tax evasion schemes, were able to grow in a hot-house atmosphere and extend their tentacles because they had their genesis at the bosom of Lloyd's well away from any outside scrutiny. It reached the point where the very people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
who were supposed to regulate those practices— the Lloyd's council—began themselves to embrace them. They ceased to be able to distinguish between what was acceptable to outside opinion and what was not. The regulators themselves became tainted by the practices that they should have been trying to stop.<br><br>
It was because of the structure of the council of Lloyd's and the way in which Lloyd's operates that the corruption was allowed to grow and develop. That is why, even if Lloyd's were now intent on putting its house in order, it would find it difficult to do so. The practices are endemic and entrenched because of the way in which Lloyd's has been regulated. I share much of the scepticism expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch on that point. It is now virtually impossible to establish who was involved in the practices.<br><br>
That is why my hon. Friend is right to question the role of Sir Peter Green in conducting his own investigations. How can we have confidence in Sir Peter Green when he has admitted that he was involved in those practices? That is the nub of the argument and that is the question that the Minister must resolve. I hope that he will take note not only of Opposition arguments, but of the weighty points made by his own hon. Friends.<br><br>
There are difficulties in some of the amendments. I would have to think long and hard before voting for amendment No. 169 in which the hon. Member for Yeovil seeks to provide for a majority of lay members on the SRO council, although I generally support what he is trying to achieve. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby may concede that there are drafting deficiencies in his amendment. Amendment No. 155, tabled by the hon. Member for Stafford, may also not go far enough. However, the Opposition will vote for any amendment that might secure majority support from the Committee, not because we think that the amendments are perfect, but because we wish to induce the Minister to offer the Committee a solution to the problem. We can then leave the matter with the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the tutor extraordinary to the Committee, especially the ESN section of the class which sits at the back, give us some idea of his preferred course? We want to return to the major issue, unless of course the Minister changes character and tells us that he has decided overnight to accept all the amendments. That is what we should like, but assuming that the hon. and learned Gentleman does not do that, and that we have to come back to the subject on Report, what should we do now about the amendments before us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was attempting to explain, unless the Minister says that he will accept one of the amendments, or gives us a categorical assurance that an amendment will be brought forward on Report to achieve the same objectives, I must recommend my hon. Friends to vote seriatim, as it were, for the amendments, to try to get a majority.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
If the Government do not like any amendment that we accept, they can come forward with their own, and better-drafted, amendment. I am sure that the Minister understands the position. We are seeking a watertight formula that would ensure a substantial—a useful term here—lay representation on the Committee. My preferred course would be for an independent chairman to be appointed, either directly by the Secretary of State or in some other way.<br><br>
It is not for me to put words into the Minister's mouth, and we shall await his reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), who gave a well-reasoned and balanced assessment of the arguments.<br><br>
I should also like to congratulate the hon Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on the usual elegance and high intellectual content of his remarks, which I am not sure were entirely understood by the ESN Members on his Back Bench.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Chichester was right to draw attention to the different needs of different SROs, as they will deal with the public to varying degrees. That makes the fixed formula suggested in some of the amendments inappropriate. However, I agree that there is urgent need for a sufficiently strong group of independent members on die SROs. I know from experience as a non-executive director that to be constantly in a minority of one in a group which has better and more detailed knowledge of die arguments, greater resources at their disposal, and who have prepared most of the papers that come before meetings, makes it difficult to go on arguing effectively from a position of independence.<br><br>
I suspect that the small group of independent members at Lloyd's have found themselves up against such problems. Independent members need to form a sufficiently large category to ensure that die SRO does not exist simply to protect its own members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was unduly, and uncharacteristically, diffident in suggesting that I would listen only to suggestions from Conservative Members, and would not give full weight to contributions from the Opposition.<br><br>
I have listened carefully to all that has been said. However, I pay particular tribute to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), who put forward a series of extremely well-balanced and convincing arguments in support of his contentions. It would be difficult to resist his arguments.<br><br>
There are important differences between die various amendments in the group. I shall tell the Committee the extent to which I can meet me points put forward.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
I agree with what hon. Members on both sides oi die Committee have said about die importance of effective, independent representation on die governing bodies of SROs, to prevent them becoming what are often described as "cosy clubs", and to ensure that proper account is taken of die interests of die users and of die general public.<br><br>
Paragraph 5 of schedule 2 seeks to achieve that objective by leaving it open to individual SROs to decide the detailed composition of their governing bodies. The paragraph contains die arrangements for
<br><blockquote><p>"the appointment, removal from office and functions of the persons responsible for making or enforcing "</p></blockquote>
the SRO's views. Those are die most important functions in respect of maintaining standards. The paragraph concerns, therefore, the people who carry out those functions, whatever their nominal title.<br><br>
Amendment No. 93, tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), and amendment No. 169, tabled by die hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), refer to " the Council", but that council might not take die key decisions on rules and enforcement. We are concerned with those who take such decisions, so we prefer die existing wording of paragraph 5 in mat respect, although I realise that it is a minor point. The main issue concerns the composition of die group of people who make those key decisions.<br><br>
Paragraph 5 requires the arrangements, first, to secure a proper balance between different groups of members. None of the amendments questions that. Secondly, the arrangement must secure a proper balance between the interests of the organisation, or its members, in the interests of die public. The paragraph does not lay down how that is to be achieved. All the amendments seek to spell out the requirements in great detail.<br><br>
Let me deal first with the position of the chairmen of recognised self-regulating organisations. Two suggestions have been made here. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil proposes that the chairmen of such organisations should be appointed and removed, by the Secretary of State. That proposal, precisely for the reasons advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, undermines the concept of self-regulation. The hon. Member for Dagenham appeared to agree with him on that point.<br><br>
The essence of a self-regulating organisation is that it should be able to choose the chairman of its governing body. Its independence would be undermined greatly if the Secretary of State—or the agency, if the power is intended to be transferable— could impose his choice of chairman, and remove him at will. The amendment would alter the balance between self-regulation and statutory intervention in an undesirable way. The Bill contains other safeguards to ensure that self-regulating organisations maintain proper standards and have due regard for the interests of users and the public.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0127">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby proposes that self-regulating organisations should have independent chairmen. For an organisation to function efficiently, it is essential that the governing body includes people with practical, up-to-date knowledge and experience of the activities to be regulated by the organisation. The role of the chairman is crucial for good regulation and the commercial success of the organisation's members. He cannot perform his task properly if he does not have a relevant background. Investors will suffer at least as much as members, if his knowledge is inadequate to enable him to reach an informed view on the issues. It will be wrong, therefore, to rule out the possibility of having a member of a self-regulating organisation as chairman.<br><br>
I cannot agree so far with the sense of the amendments with which I have been dealing. The remaining amendments impose specific requirements to have users and/or other independent representatives on the governing bodies of self-regulating organisations. The amendments would make explicit a requirement which is already implicit in schedule 2. Normally, independent representatives will be necessary to meet the requirement in paragraph <i>5(b).</i> It is difficult to see how that could be met in any other way.<br><br>
The Securities and Investments Board has said that, if powers to recognise SROs are transferred to it, it will expect those organisations to have a number of independent members of high standing in appropriate positions in their governing bodies. It is thinking in terms of about a quarter to a third of the members of the governing body being independent of the organisation. I welcome that statement.<br><br>
The Bill does not impose specific requirements because it is right to leave to SROs the decision about the precise composition of their governing bodies, in the light of their circumstances and needs, provided that the basic requirement of securing the proper balance is met. Again, that point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. A specific requirement for a standard percentage of the governing body to represent particular interests would, in my view, be undesirably rigid. It would involve deciding into which category an individual fitted.<br><br>
For example, if half the governing body had to be users or other independents, how would an accountant who did work for members and users be categorised? What about a non-executive director of a member company who had been appointed because of his wide knowledge and independent judgment? Would he qualify as an independent member of would he have to be grouped with the members' representatives, even though he had not been elected by them as one of their representatives?<br><br>
It is also important to avoid the appointment of someone with no relevant experience merely to make up the number of independents. The quality of members is the most important consideration.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making a valid point about the difficulty of categorising people, but he will not avoid the difficulty by making the formula less precise. We are worried that an imprecise formula will cause the supposedly independent sector of the organisation to comprise precisely the sort of people whom he described—those with close links with the SRO.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the point is met if we talk about a proper balance rather than a rigid, fixed proportion as suggested in the amendment of the hon Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). That would immediately call into question the precise definitions to which I referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting a bit schizophrenic about the Minister's speech. He began very accommodatingly but as soon as he put his head down and started reading his brief—rather like a planning lawyer who finds himself in a criminal court and has to stick closely to the words given to him—he became cold and harsh and unsympathetic. The Minister should put some of his own natural warmth into the speeches written for him.<br><br>
I am puzzled because the Minister is dealing solely with the question of proportions and independent members. My amendment also specifies users as a separate category. Surely there is need for a provision for users. Will the Minister tell us his view on that suggestion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member must refrain his natural impatience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to go to the Building Societies Bill Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point about users is extremely important and I shall come to it soon.<br><br>
The amendment of my hon Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) seeks to avoid the problems by providing for "a substantial number" of independent persons and is less rigid than the amendment of the hon Member for Great Grimsby. My hon Friend's formulation does not entirely avoid the difficulty, to which he drew attention, of deciding what constitutes " substantial" or a proper balance. Ultimately, that is a matter for the Secretary of State or for the agency.<br><br>
The Secretary of State may recognise an SRO only if the requirements of paragraph 5 appear to be met. It is for the Secretary of State to examine the constitution of the SRO and die people that it proposes should serve on its governing body and to decide whether they will secure a proper balance between the interests of the organisation and its members and the interests of the public. That is the essential safeguard.<br><br>
Amendment No. 81 in the name of the hon. Member for Dagenham would add the interests of users to those of the public. Other amendments would require user representatives on the governing body. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hope that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby will listen to the information for which he was so impatient a few moments ago.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0128">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
We envisage the interests of users—in this instance they are the consumers—and of potential users forming the most important aspect of the interests of the public. Representatives of users will have the knowledge and experience to enable them to provide effective lay representation on the governing bodies of SROs. I hope and expect that independent representatives on the governing bodies of those organisations will include users.<br><br>
It is clear that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have a strong preference for an explicit requirement for users and other lay representatives to serve on the governing bodies of those organisations.<br><br>
The Bill is intended to ensure such representation, but I shall undertake to consider how the requirement can be spelt out more clearly. Perhaps the formula in amendment No. 70 put forward by the hon. Member for Dagenham will provide a good starting point. It includes the specific requirement to have independent representation, while retaining the concept of a proper balance. The amendment avoids rigid formulae, but makes it clear that token independent representation is not enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has referred sympathetically to amendment No. 70 in the name of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). As he might be inclined to accept that amendment wholesale, may I draw his attention to the word " shall"? If that word is used, the Secretary of State would have to ensure that there was independent representation on every SRO. The word " may " would give him a veto and is therefore more appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for consideration, and not one on which I can commit myself now. It could be argued that the Secretary of State should be required to satisfy himself that the requirement is met. That is the effect of the amendment as it stands. I thank my hon. Friend for throwing me that line, but I hope that he will not think me ungrateful if I decline to grasp it immediately. I am not sure that we should water down the requirement. The present wording of amendment No. 70 may provide a solution to the problem, but we should consider it in greater detail.<br><br>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby in amendment No. 164 that independent persons in this context should mean not just persons independent of the organisation, but those who are not a member of another SRO, or otherwise connected closely with an authorised business. Perhaps that point also requires a specific reference.<br><br>
I propose to reflect on all those matters, in the light of our debate, and to bring forward an amendment on Report, taking amendment No. 70 as my starting point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's conciliatory attitude. He is obviously taking the Committee's views into account, although he may be paying more attention to his hon. Friends than to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
Opposition Members. In our previous sitting the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) asked me a few questions. He asked—and the Minister picked up this point—whether we proposed appointment and dismissal, and whether that would not diminish the self-regulatory capacity of the SROs. I do not follow that logic, and I do not follow the Minister's logic. The Minister and his right hon. Friends appoint the chairmen of nationalised industries, but when questioned in the House, Ministers will often throw up their hands and say, "Nothing to do with me. I can't answer that question. That's a matter for the industry." The Minister has not made a powerful case.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon asked why the power to dismiss was necessary. Those powers can be handed down to the SIB when the Minister thinks it appropriate. The hon. Gentleman also asked how we would staff such an organisation. There is nothing in my amendment that points to a large number of people being required than would be required under the Bill. I have merely suggested a composition that would ensure a proper balance. The amendment does not contain a requirement for an extra number of people, although it requires different sorts of people. The Government's seemingly interminable list of the great and the good would ensure that there would be no difficulty in finding people to sit on the council if an insufficient number of people volunteered their services.<br><br>
Finally, the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon raised a matter that was surprisingly backed up by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould): if more than half were non-members, would it still be a self-regulatory organisation? The hon. Member for Dagenham said that that was going too far, yet the second line of subparagraph <i>(d)</i> of amendment No. 93 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the persons referred to in paragraphs <i>(c)</i> and <i>(d)</i> above".</p></blockquote>
That implies that there should be a third of each of those persons specified in subparagraphs <i>(c)</i> and <i>(d)</i> rather than a third of the two combined. So amendment No. 93 goes much further than my amendment.<br><br>
If members of the organisation cannot get any support from the users or those representing the public interest, surely they cannot be onto a good thing; they will find themselves isolated. Although, theoretically, having members comprising less than half the organisation may reduce, or even destroy completely, the self-regulating capacity, in practice, if they are not able to get any support from the users of the organisation or from members of the public, they cannot be onto a good thing and perhaps they should be inhibited in that capacity.<br><br>
I do not wish to delay the Committee and I shall not press the amendment to a vote, particularly as the Minister has said that he will consider the matter. It will be interesting to see how far the Minister goes. I have a commitment to one or two points, as I made clear on Second Reading. One reason for not pressing my amendment now is that, in the light of the Minister's remarks, I may wish to return to the matter on Third Reading. On that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0129">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
basis, I am happy to stay with amendment No. 93, which covers most of the points, although perhaps not as eloquently or as fully as I would wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have significant reservations about some aspects of what I have just heard. It would be more helpful if the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) stuck to the issue before us and did not wander off into the workings of Lloyd's and into other areas.<br><br>
The clause is extremely important; it goes to the centre of how SROs will operate. I was pleased to find that the Minister is moving significantly towards the amendment that I tabled, even though he did not spend too much time discussing it. The notion in my amendment No. 155 meets any of the Minister's points.<br><br>
There would be serious difficulties if the Secretary of State were given this function, as suggested in amendment No. 70. Furthermore, I am not happy about a picking and choosing operation for different types of SROs, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) suggested, because the SIB will be able to make those judgments if our amendments to clause 12 are accepted.<br><br>
Having said that, there is a general principle to be addressed. A recent article in <i>The Times</i> by Michael Prest examined LHW Futures and certain exchanges in the City and the difficulty of that body in getting itself recognised.<br><br>
I do not need to go into the merits or the detail of that case, but questions do arise as to whether SROs should have such principles applied to them across the board.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester said—and as we have all been saying—there is this important question of investor protection, but there is also the question of supply and stability of supply. Furthermore, people should be satisfied that the market as a whole is working efficiently. There is, therefore, a strong case for an across-the-board principle and I hope therefore, that my hon. and learned Friend will bring forward amendments that apply across the board and will not pick and choose.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend referred to paragraph 5 of schedule 2. That paragraph uses the word "functions" which is very vague, and also refers to the
<br><blockquote><p>"arrangements of the organisation with respect to the … functions of the persons responsible".</p></blockquote>
My amendment No. 155 deals with the rules of the SROs, and is much more specific.<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend was choosing his words extremely carefully. He used the phrase "I hope " and said something about getting the osition more clear. I think that he also said " would normally be necessary".<br><br>
I am most anxious that my hon. and learned Friend should make it absolutely clear that he is proposing to bring forward on Report an amendment to incorporate the criteria that I have suggested, although I have no special desire for my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
wording to be taken up. I think the same arguments lie at the heart of Opposition amendments, in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must first defend myself against the attacks of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) who has presumably gone off now to hear me reply in the Standing Committee on the Building Societies Bill.<br><br>
I get the impression that this is typical alliance party tactics, all noise and no backbone. When the question arises of voting on his own amendment, the hon. Gentleman receives a sudden message on his bleeper from his right hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) asking for more of the Paddy Ashdown memorial mugs that he keeps in such large numbers in his office.<br><br>
Even if the hon. Member for Yeovil does not have the determination to press his own amendment, I shall certainly press mine. What the Minister has offered is simply not enough. I found a note of schizophrenia throughout the Minister's speech. His initial stance was accommodating, but as soon as he came to his prepared brief, and read it out to us, we found that it was hostile. It was clearly written by civil servants—the civil servant is the man whose doormat says, "Not Unwelcome". That was the stance that the Minister took in the brief, even though his opening statement had been accommodating.<br><br>
I suspect the Minister, even when he is accommodating because on Tuesday, in reply to my argument about libel being a tactic and a weapon to be used against the SROs, he said " qualified privilege".<br><br>
However, the Gower report on investor protection quotes Sir John Donaldson, in a fairly negative opinion, on the Hasselblad case as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is only the very rich, the very foolish, the very malicious or the very dedicated who will knowingly put themselves in a position in which they have to defend a libel action—even with the benefit of qualified privilege."</p></blockquote>
So much for the Minister's remarks on Tuesday— my legal expertise is beginning to develop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that Sir John Donaldson is a famous Tory?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case the Minister will listen more assiduously to Sir John Donaldson than he does to us. I suggest that the Minister should listen to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore), who has shown overwhelming knowledge of the Bill and its background. It might be as well to adjourn the Committee for a couple of weeks so that my hon. Friend can give the Minister tutorials in the ESN section of the class about what the Bill is about and what it should achieve.<br><br>
The Minister's assurances are too vague to be satisfactory. My amendment has its faults—anything drafted by me is bound to have faults. The last line but one should read:
<br><blockquote><p>"the persons"—</p></blockquote>
not person—
<br><blockquote><p>"referred to in paragraphs <i>(c)</i> and <i>(d)</i> above".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0130">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
Moreover, when the amendment says:
<br><blockquote><p>"not less than one-third of the total membership of the Council."</p></blockquote>
it means one third of the total membership taken together. That is the intention of the amendment which shines through with all its honest integrity notwithstanding the inadequacies of my wording.<br><br>
Opposition Members desire that intention to be laid down specifically and clearly so that we are not bound by vague commitments which can be negated by the SRO. We want it spelt out. It is important to press the amendment to a Division to establish the importance of its principle. We know that the Minister will try to fulfil his vague assurances, but we should like his hands tied to them.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 136, line 45, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The organisation shall be under a duty to cooperate, in the provision of information and in other matters, with the designated agency and with all other authorities in cases where its members are suspected of having committed offences under this Act or offences under other enactments or the common law.".</p></blockquote>
The intention of the amendment is plain, and I had the example of Lloyd's in mind when my hon. Friends and I tabled it. The frequency with which Lloyd's has been mentioned gives the lie to the view that the Bill has nothing to do with Lloyd's. Lloyd's is very much at the heart of our anxieties.<br><br>
The Committee will recall that, a few months ago, Lloyd's published the results of its internal inquiry into what had gone wrong in the PCW affair, and imposed fines on Peter Cameron-Webb and others. But many people were dissatisfied with the outcome of those proceedings. There was a question mark about whether the fine would ever be paid by someone who had fled the country. There is also continuing unease, which is true of that episode and many others, about the apparent failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions to assemble evidence on which to bring a successful prosecution.<br><br>
That case involved the supposed inability of Lloyd's, by virtue of a byelaw, to pass over to the authorities, including the DPP, the record of the interviews which it had conducted with those whom it was seeking to discipline. The final appreciation of the position was not necessarily accurate. As I understand it, Lloyd's conceded that there was nothing in its byelaws to stop it handing over those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
documents. But it left a strong impression that Lloyd's, and possibly other SROs in a similar position in the future, will also refrain for various reasons —perhaps out of loyalty to former colleagues— from passing over to the authorities the necessary documentation and evidence for a successful prosecution. Amendment No. 127 imposes a specific duty on SROs to co-operate with the relevant authorities in providing information which might be necessary in such cases.<br><br>
It may be argued that paragraph 7 of the schedule already imposes a general requirement for co-operation in the provision of information. However, I argue that the amendment has merit for two reasons. First, it spells out the desirability of fulfilling that obligation in the case of suspected criminal offences. Secondly, as will become apparent from an amendment to be debated later, there is a peculiar indirectness about the requirement in paragraph 7—that the body must be "able and willing" to carry out specific tasks, although no duty is imposed on it to do so. The merit of my amendment is that it avoids that lack of precision, and makes it clear that the SRO would be under a positive duty to co-operate in that way.<br><br>
The Minister may be unwilling to accept the amendment for various reasons, but I hope that he will assure us that he is aware of the problem and that, when the Bill is enacted, he will ensure that SROs do not, for any reason, refrain from co-operating with the authorities, where a prosecution is clearly desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) because one of the points that has come to my notice over the past six months is the extraordinary complexity of dealing with the type of cases with which SROs will have to deal, and the large number of bodies involved. The SROs and SIB will have to deal with the Department of Trade and Industry, the fraud squad, the DPP and, in some cases, with bodies excluded from the Bill, such as the Takeover Panel. In some circumstances, all those bodies have been involved. It is important that the information obtained by one body should be freely and readily available to the other bodies.<br><br>
I wish to refer briefly to the case of Peter Cameron-Webb, and the problem which my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham raised. I am still unclear whether the problem involved the handing over of the documents under the byelaws—that would be dealt with by the amendment—or whether it was something to do with extradition, or the opening of the Swiss bank accounts. I believe that one authority was saying that there was one problem, and another authority was saying that there was another problem. We must try to remove each of the problems one by one. My hon. Friend does a great service to the Committee by bringing the amendment forward.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) correctly identified the nature of my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0131">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
response. It relies on schedule 2(7), which states that a self-regulating organisation
<br><blockquote><p>"must be able and willing … to co-operate, by the sharing of information and otherwise, with the Secretary of State and any other authority, body or person having responsibility for the supervision or regulation of investment business or other financial services."</p></blockquote>
If an SRO failed to co-operate, it would be in breach of that paragraph, and the Secretary of State or the designated agency would have grounds to revoke its recognition under clause 11, apply for a compliance order under clause 12, or issue a restriction of business direction under clause 13. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.<br><br>
The amendment goes further than would be desirable, even, I suspect, to the hon. Gentleman. It would make it the duty of SROs to co-operate whenever a member may be suspected of committing any offence under statute or common law, even if it has no connection with investment business. Paragraph 7 of schedule 2 is more than sufficient to meet the hon. Gentleman's point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shore-ditch (Mr. Sedgemore) will be aware of the full written answer given by the Solicitor-General on 25 November 1985, in which he explained why the investigations into the PCW syndicate and Alexander Howden were not yet complete and had not led to prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 7 of schedule 2 does not do quite what the Minister thinks it does. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The organisation must be able and willing to promote and maintain high standards of integrity and fair dealing in the carrying on of investment business and to co-operate, by the sharing of information and otherwise, with the Secretary of State and any other authority, body or person having responsibility for the supervision ",</p></blockquote>
and so on. That leaves it to the SRO to decide whether what it provides is satisfactory in the promotion and maintenance of high standards. There could be a difference of opinion about what is sufficient information.<br><br>
Will the Minister make it clear that all information sought by the Secretary of State or the SIB will be available, and that their opinion about it, as well as the opinion of the SRO, will count?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first part of the hon. Gentleman's point was remote from the second part. He is wrong to suggest that schedule 2(7) leaves it to the SRO to decide whether it complies with the requirement.<br><br>
The schedule is entitled " Requirements for Recognition of Self-regulating Organisation". Self-regulating organisations will have to satisfy those requirements before they can be recognised. The recognising body—whether that is the Secretary of State or the designated agency to which he may transfer his powers—will be the one who has to be satisfied that the requirements of paragraph 7 are met. There is no question of leaving that decision to the SROs, as the requirements will have to be met before an SRO is recognised. Thereafter, if an SRO failed to comply with paragraph 7, the recognising body could take the remedies available under the other clauses.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that if an SRO simply made a statement that it was willing to comply with paragraph 7, that would be sufficient to secure designation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, of course not. The Secretary of State or, if the powers were transferred, the designated agency, would investigate and would have to be satisfied that the organisation was able and willing to deal with such matters. As the hon. Member knows, the SIB is preparing rules that will indicate the basis of its approach to that. There is no question of leaving the SRO to satisfy the requirement on its own say-so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied that the Minister is pursuing the same objective as we are, but I suspect that he has not taken full account of the problems to which two of my hon. Friends have drawn attention.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) pointed out that in the case of Lloyd's, it is not clear on what grounds there is a difficulty. The question of ability and willingness can be a complex one, which is difficult to unravel.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) drew attention to a difficulty about the concept of willingness. Willingness is something that is difficult to establish in advance; it would arise only in a specific instance, well after authorisation had been granted.<br><br>
In general terms the Minister seems ready to rely on an ex-post facto enforcement of the structural provisions of the Bill, such as the threat to de-authorise. Many of us believe that that is an unrealistic approach; we want to be certain about how SROs will conduct their affairs.<br><br>
If a case were to arise in which an SRO said, "For this or that reason, we are not able or willing to provide the information," the sanction of going through the laborious procedure of de-authorising the SRO would not be effective. It would be simpler to impose a specific duty and to say, " it is a legal duty and if you choose not to do it, we shall go off to the court and get an order of mandamus to make you do it."<br><br>
I shall not press the matter now, but we may wish to return to it on Report, and the Minister may wish to think about it further. On that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 137, line 1, leave out

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is closely related to the debate that we have just concluded. It is designed to impose a direct and specific obligation on the SROs in place of the concepts of ability and willingness. Amendments No. 180 and No. 181 are designed to have the same effect in schedule 3.<br><br>
My purpose in tabling the amendment is simply to ask the Minister why the provision is drafted as it is, why the phrase "able and willing" is there, and why it would not be simplier, to use the language of obligation to achieve the objective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the language in the schedule is that many of the self-regulating organisations likely to apply for recognition would still be at an early stage of formation. It would not be reasonable to require them to demonstrate a history of regulating their members, as the amendment appears to require, because they would not have been in existence long enough to establish such a history. The number of likely applicants for recognition as a registered investment exchange which already exists, is rather higher, but it would still tend to hinder the development of new competitive exchanges if they, too, had to demonstrate a satisfactory history of regulation before applying for recognition.<br><br>
The Bill therefore provides that the Secretary of State can recognise an SRO only if he is satisfied that it is able and willing to promote high standards and to co-operate with other regulators. In reaching his decision, he will be able to take into account such matters as the resources that the SRO or the investment exchange has available for these purposes and where the organisation or exchange has been in existence for some time he will be able to take account of its history as well. An organisation or exchange with an unsatisfactory track record is unlikely to be regarded as able and willing to carry out those functions.<br><br>
If a recognised SRO or investment exchange subsequently failed to promote and maintain high standards or to co-operate with other regulators the Secretary of State would be entitled to conclude that it was either unable or unwilling to do so. He could then take one of the courses open to him, which I have summarised, when he believes that the SRO or the investment exchange does not comply with one of the recognition requirements, by revoking the recognition order, applying to the courts for a compliance order or issuing a restriction of business direction.<br><br>
It is important to appreciate that the recognition sanction, which the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) emphasised, is by no means the only sanction available to the designated agency in those circumstances. A wide range of sanctions are available and they would be sufficient for the designated agency to be able to ensure that the requirements are complied with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was remarkably, indeed refreshingly, frank in his explanation of why the words are in the provision. He immediately re-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
vealed what is common knowledge: there is great difficulty in placing reliance on some SROs that will be pressed into service under the structure proposed in the Bill, simply because they do not exist or do not have a record of experience or expertise in this area.<br><br>
That reveals and demonstrates the severe limitation of the authorisation procedure. The Minister has conceded, in effect, that he or the SIB will eventually authorise SROs in a spirit of hope rather than of certainty. There will be no record; he will simply accept assurances. I agree that he will be able to look at rules, but as to willingness to co-operate, he must accept assurances or rely on the good faith of those concerned. That may not be justified in every case. I hesitate to be too cynical, but I suspect that instances will arise where the faith of the Minister in the good faith of the SROs will be misplaced.<br><br>
It is precisely for that reason that the Opposition would like to use the language of specific obligation. Having made that point clearly—it is relevant to later debates—I shall not press the matter to' a vote and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I hope that I shall not be accused of tedious repetition if I complain yet again about the cramped nature of the room in which we have to conduct our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add that for those of us who are in close proximity to the heating system it is becoming something more akin to a sauna. Can you tell us, Sir Michael, what progress you are making on the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must emphasise that this is not a matter for me but, as I have explained, I have taken the matter up on behalf of the Committee. As far as I can make out, it is impossible at present to better our accommodation, but none the less, I repeated my wish this morning that our claims be kept at the top of the pile.<br><br>
In view of what may well arise at our next sitting, it is important that we have better accommodation for members of the Committee. I am sorry that I can do no more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. If it is impossible for us to change rooms, would it be possible to have the temperature lowered in this one? It feels like a room that has been double glazed by some crook firm nominated by the Small Business Bureau at Smith Square and probably recommended in the first place by Mr. Shanji to the Conservative party.<br><br>
It is, frankly, cooler in the Room where the Standing Committee on the Building Societies Bill is meeting, and that is only two doors down.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those points have been noted. The position is unsatisfactory and it is obvious to all that even the usual inadequate system of ventilation has been further worsened by the temporary nature of the material covering the windows. We will raise the matter again, but I do not know whether it is capable of individual adjustment. Ever since I have been in the House—I am sure it has been the same for many generations—the lack of appropriate accommodation has been one of our most frequent complaints.<br><br>
I can assure the Committee that it has the full sympathy of its Chairman who also has to suffer, and he has to sit here all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. May I raise the related question of the press facilities in this Room. I make no claims for the importance of this Bill in relation to other Bills, but I have heard this morning from a member of the press—whom we are not supposed to talk to—that a member of the quality press wanted to come into the Room but could not. It is outrageous that the facilities should be available to only two members of the press.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All the facilities are inadequate for the Committee, which is a very important Committee. I know that all Committees regard themselves as important, but this is especially important and is of the great possible interest to those outside. I shall press that point also.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 109 raises important questions. We are falling into the habit of saying that all our amendments are important but this one is, because it deals with the relationship between the SIB and the SROs.<br><br>
This group of amendments affects in similar ways a series of clauses relating to bodies that will obtain authorisation or recognition. The purpose of the amendment is two-fold. It is proposed to give the SIB a more flexible power when it is dissatisfied with the function and role of an SRO or other recognised body.<br><br>
In our previous debate the Minister correctly said that de-authorisation was not the only sanction available. Nevertheless, there is a genuine worry, which we shall debate on later amendments about the nuclear deterrent—I use a fashionable phrase— of de-authorisation and the lack of a more flexible range of remedies or sanctions which the SIB may wish to use in appropriate circumstances. If the SIB is limited to de-authorisation or having to go to court, there may be less supervision than there would be if the SIB had a less extreme range of remedies.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
Clause 27, which cover direct authorisation, contains the specific provision that the SIB can suspend authorisation. The amendments would extend that option to the other activities of authorisation and recognition that the SIB undertakes. The amendment can hardly be objected to. It would provide a useful addition to the range of actions, available to the SIB. Instead of being about only to revoke an authorisation, the SIB should be able to suspend it for a specified period where de-authorisa-was inappropriate but where the SIB wanted a sanction to compel a response from the SRO or other authorised body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What practical advantage would there be in suspension? If an SRO were suspended for even a short time, surely its members would seek either direct authorisation or membership of another SRO.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but the SIB would use suspension only in extreme circumstances. Suspension is a less severe step than de-authorisation and would open up the possibility of reviving authorisation as soon as the SIB was satisfied that the conditions were met. For the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave, that could be very soon. It is difficult to envisage objections to the SIB having such a power. It may be more appropriately exercised in some authorisation activities than in others, but it is a useful addition to the armoury.<br><br>
The second objective of the amendment is to reverse the burden of proof so that the SIB or the Secretary of State do not have to satisfy themselves of a failure to comply with the conditions before they de-authorise a body, but can remain to be convinced by the authorised body that it continues to comply with the requirements.<br><br>
That may not seem an important distinction, but, for the reason that the Minister advanced at our previous debate, it is of immense importance. At the moment of authorisation when the Bill is enacted, the designation order will be made and the SIB will proceed to authorise. As the Minister conceded, the SIB will inevitably be dealing with SROs that are unknown quantities. In the frenzied rush to become authorised, there will be an awkward hiatus between the big bang on 27 October and the coming into effect of the Bill's provisions. There will be pressure and many organisations will be authorised in a rush. As the Minister himself concedes, they will be authorised under circumstances in which little may be known about some of the bodies that will be queueing up with their applications.<br><br>
When the SIB first has time to draw breath, having authorised enough people to let the securities industry get on with its business, it may find—and the SIB thinks that it is a real possibility—that it has authorised some people about whom it knows little and to whom it has given insufficient consideration. It may then be able to form a more considered judgment on them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
Under those circumstances, which are all too likely to arise, the SIB would be handicapped by the need to prove positively that it had made a mistake. It would help the SIB or whichever body will perform that function, if the authorised organisations had to prove that they continued to meet the requirement.<br><br>
The SIB thinks that that is an important matter, and it supports the general thrust of my amendments. I see that the Minister is seeking advice on the attitude of the SIB. I can give him a document in which the SIB makes that point.<br><br>
Given the Minister's remark that some bodies with no record or experience will have to be authorised, I hope that he will recognise the merit in allowing the SIB to consider at greater leisure, at least for an opening period, the questions that it will eventually have to decide in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's view that a variety of powers should be available if a recognised SRO fails to satisfy the requirements for recognition. That is why, in addition to the power to revoke a recognition order, the Bill provides in clause 12 for applications to the courts for compliance orders and in clause 13 for a power to limit the business that a recognised SRO can regulate.<br><br>
The amendments would add nothing of significance to that armoury. The immediate effect of suspending the recognition of an SRO or a recognised professional body would be the same as revoking it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) pointed out. It was significant that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) could not point to any difference.<br><br>
If the recognition of an SRO or professional body were suspended or revoked, its members would not need to seek alternative authorisation. In the case of an investment exchange, suspension would affect the operation of the market, rather than anybody's authorisation, but the immediate effect would be the same as a revocation.<br><br>
The only difference is that at the end of a suspension period the SRO, professional body, or investment exchange would be recognised automatically, without having to re-apply. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman regards that as an advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asserted that I had not pointed to any difference, but in his concluding comments he conceded and, indeed, reinforced my argument.<br><br>
Of course—I conceded as much to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith)—the point about the immediate fact of the suspension is well taken. However, one envisages the suspension power being used sparingly and for brief periods. It is not unknown for investment exchanges to be closed for short periods for one reason or another. It would be useful for the SIB to have that weapon, and for it to provide for an automatic revival of authorisation, without having to go through the whole process of authorisation again.</span></p>

<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether suspension would be of the slightest comfort to members of the SROs who would be faced with the immediate need to gain alternative authorisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not meant to comfort them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'> Suspension would offer no advantage over revocation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I misunderstand the argument. Clause 13 refers to the legal proceedings required to bring action under restriction of business. For example, a direction is enforceable in Scotland.
<br><blockquote><p>"by an order for specific performance under section 91 of the Court of Session Act 1868."</p></blockquote>
A compliance order means an application to a court.<br><br>
If that is the alternative to suspension it is surely a far more long-winded approach than the almost immediate impact that suspension would have; suspension would allow the Secretary of State to take immediate action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has misunderstood the extent of the sanctions in the Bill. It is not suggested by his hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that suspension should be exercised in any way that is different from the power of revocation, or indeed the power of restriction of business. As the hon. Gentleman said, a compliance order has to be obtained through the court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, that is a different matter. The power to revoke or to restrict business would be exercised in exactly the same way as the additional power for which the hon. Member for Dagenham asks. They would all be powers that would repose—in the event of a transfer of powers from the Secretary of State—in a designated agency, and the agency would be able to take action.<br><br>
The only question at issue is whether there should be a power of suspension in addition to the power of revocation that the Bill provides. I suggest that as the effect of both would be to require any member of an SRO to be authorised in an alternative way with immediate effect, the amendment would not be a significant addition to the Bill and would have little impact.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham also asked about revoking recognition, and whether the burden of proof should be different. He suggested that the burden of proof on the Secretary of State or the designated agency should ge lighter.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Gentleman was referring to circumstances in which there might be some uncertainty on the part of the Secretary of State or the designated agency so that they would be unable to satisfy the burden of proof for which provision is made in the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
I suggest that the power already exists in the Bill for the Secretary of State or the designated agency to require the SROs, investment exchange, professional body or whatever to provide additional information if such is needed. If there is a question of doubt and if the Secretary of State—or the designated agency—is not certain that he—or it—has the information required to satisfy the burden of proof required under the Bill he can require additional information from the body concerned. That is a much more satisfactory method of dealing with the matter.<br><br>
It is of the greatest importance to SROs and other similar bodies that they should not be able to have their recognition withdrawn, unless there is good reason. The provisions enabling the Secretary of State and the designated agency to require further information from those bodies meet the hon. Gentleman's point more effectively and satisfactorily than does his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but he is dealing with a slightly different point. Obviously, I see the relevance of his comments, but, although it is certainly useful to have the power to call for additional information, I foresee a different problem —where all the information is available, but one has to decide how to interpret it. Under the Bill, the SIB must be satisfied that there has been a failure to comply, which may be difficult to prove. I am proposing a reversal of the burden of proof, so that those who already have the authorisation must show to the SIB's satisfaction that they are continuing to comply with the rules. I am making a different point from that made by the Minister about the availability of information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not be sensible to embark on a lengthy discussion about whether it is a different point. The main point is that the designated agency has the power to request information. It can obtain all the available information, and then has to decide whether it is satisfied that the self-regulating organisation is no longer complying with the rules. In reaching that decision, it can take into account the fact that, notwithstanding its request for information, there is still an absence of information. But, given the fact that we are talking about a self-regulating organisation which, by definition, would have been recognised by that stage, and could authorise people carrying on investment business, it seems unreasonable that recognition should be removed where the designated agency cannot discharge the burden of proof that it is satisfied that an organisation is no longer complying with the requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and I do not intend to labour this point. But we must look at the position where the SIB de-authorises, and that decision is taken to the High Court for judicial review. A precise question will then be asked—did it appear to the SIB that there was a failure to comply? That is a different question from that which I am proposing in the amendments— did the applicant fail to satisfy the SIB about those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
conditions? That is a genuine distinction, which alters the nature of the legal issue that would eventually arise in court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not sought to deny that there would be a difference. After initial recognition of an SRO—given the fact that the designated agency has all the necessary powers to require the SRO to supply information to it—the designated agency, in any application for judicial review, should be able to satisfy itself and the court that the organisation has not complied with the requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the powers under clause 27, which permit the Secretary of State to suspend authorisations granted by him. Perhaps the Minister will ask his officials to consider what a "person" means in that context, because, otherwise, the definition of a person may include a self-regulating organisation. If that were the case, it would be difficult to accept many of his comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly, not to give the speech that I was about to give in the Building Societies Bill Committee before it adjourned, but to make clear my disappointment at the Minister's reaction to the telling speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).<br><br>
As I was observing facial behaviour at the beginning of my hon. Friend's speech, the Minister was nodding some degree of assent. He was then passed two notes, rather like a naughty pupil listening to a transistor, and his expression became stern and forbidding. That emerged in the course of his speech, which was disappointing. It made clear the inadequacy of the position forced on the Government by giving to the SIB only the thermonuclear weapon of abolition of the SROs.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's amendment proposes greater control. We are anxious that greater control should operate in the formative period, which is a point largely ignored by the Minister. In many areas we are effectively giving a blank cheque to SROs that do not exist, or of which we know nothing, and in many respects know little of their spheres. We are legislating for a mirage.<br><br>
The provisions in the amendments are sensible safeguards for the SIB. They shift the weight and give the board a more graduated series of weapons apart from the thermonuclear weapon. It is a sensible provision, particularly for the awkwardness of that transitional period. Compounded by the big bang in the stock exchange, that period will be fraught with difficulties and transitional problems. Why not, therefore, pay attention to the difficulties of that period and give the greater flexibility that our amendments propose?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not support the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) in his amendment that requires that we introduce the idea of suspension. A suspended halfway house would benefit nobody. Although I accept all the hon. Gentleman's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
arguments on the thermonuclear deterrent in clause 11—the Nagasaki option as the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) has called it—I think that the matter would be better dealt with when we reach clause 12.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Is it not remarkable that the Liberal spokesman can walk back into the Committee and reject all the arguments when he was not even present to hear them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are responsible for their own speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Working-ton (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is clearly a person whose mouth runs away with him; neither does he use his ears. If he used his ears and his eyes he would know that I was present when the hon. Member for Dagenham moved the amendment. I heard his argument in some detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. We accept your ruling that hon. Members are responsible for their own speeches, but we do not know the instructions that are coming through the transmitter on the belt of the hon. Member for Yeovil.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Occasionally the seriousness of the debate deteriorates and thereby lessens its overall quality. We are discussing a serious matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Michael, for that comment. I should have felt constrained to make it myself had you not done so, although I am not sure how the interventions of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) could deteriorate further.<br><br>
I cannot support the hon. Member for Dagenham on the word "suspended" because it is unnecessary. Providing the Minister with more suitable and flexible instruments for getting his way or imposing the controls that the Bill ought to have are more elegantly dealt with under clause 12.<br><br>
However, I take the argument of the hon. Member for Dagenham seriously and I support it wholeheartedly where it seeks to put the burden of proof on the SROs. What I heard of the Minister's discussion of that aspect was not convincing and if that amendment were pushed to a vote I should support it. It is important that the SROs should have the burden of proof placed upon them; they, rather than the SIB, must satisfy the requirements of the Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have little to add, save to observe that not only will we have little experience of the SROs, but the SROs themselves may have little experience of their members in the circumstances that we contemplate. It is essentially the members who will be authorised by the process. Because the procedure will, for the reasons that I have given, take place in a hurry, many people may become authorised within the framework of SROs that have little experience of regulating them. For that reason,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
it would be a prudent measure to reverse the burden of proof in the way that I suggest, I thank the Member for Yeovil for his support.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is also concerned with the relationship between the SIB and the SROs. It is important to get that relationship right and give the designated agency the powers that it needs to do the job.<br><br>
What happens if clause 10(3) or schedule 2 are not complied with by a self-regulating organisation? What sanctions are available to the designated agency to secure compliance? There is clause 11, which we have just examined; there is clause 12, which provides that the agency may apply to the court for a compliance order; and there is clause 13, which provides that the agency may direct an organisation or itself alter the rules of the self-regulating organisation so that they restrict the business.<br><br>
If we look at the three clauses together we see that clause 12 is an exception. Clauses 11 and 13 give the SIB a direct power to intervene; clause 12 provides that the SIB must go to the court to apply for a compliance order. I ask my hon. and learned Friend: why is clause 12 framed in this way? It is not clear to me why there should be a direct power in clause 11 and 13, and in the case of clause 13 why the agency should itself be able to alter the rules of an SRO, whereas clause 12 requires the agency to go to court.<br><br>
The matter was raised on Second Reading by the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith). In replying to him, my right hon. and learned Friend the former Secretary of State said that we would succeed in the endeavour only if we were able to attract to the SROs
<br><blockquote><p>"people of calibre, integrity, experience and knowledge." <i>[Official Report,</i> 14th January 1986; Vol. 89, c. 947.]</p></blockquote>
He argued that if we allowed the agency the direct power to intervene, that principle would be somehow undermined and that it would be more difficult to recruit such people. However, the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) said that it was a matter not of great principle but of balance and of where the burden should lie.<br><br>
I believe that the balance should be reversed. The amendment would provide that if the court were involved, that would happen at the instigation of the SRO, not at the instigation of the agency. I am reinforced in my view by the knowledge that SIB share my opinion that the weight of balance should be the other way.<br><br>
If we wish SIB to do an effective job we must give it adequate powers. SIB wants a more direct and effective means of ensuring continued compliance. SIB's note says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The need is for intermediate sanctions that could be applied rapidly—for example, to ensure that all SROs quickly enacted a rule to prevent a particular abuse, or perhaps to raise capital adequacy standards."</p></blockquote>
Speed is the important need. In some circumstances, SIB will want the power to act quickly—not the delay involved in court action—to require an SRO to change its rules. If there is to be an argument, it can take place afterwards in court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have here the opportunity to make progress. I am much encouraged by the signatories
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
to amendment No. 182 to believe that the Minister may also be prepared to move in that direction.<br><br>
My own amendment, No. 22, is a less full version of amendment No. 182. I tabled it earlier without direct reference to SIB and I was pleased that, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will concede, SIB drafted its own amendment and showed forcefully that it would support the general thrust of my amendment. I share the hon. Gentleman's view that this is a crucial element of the Bill. From the outset, the question has worried a good number of people outside and inside the Committee. Many believe that it is essential in the extreme cases for which we must inevitably legislate, that SIB should have the power to say, "Change your rules".<br><br>
Many problems have arisen because there are no mechanisms to detect and deal with abuses sooner. As we said earlier, they become entrenched and difficult to disentagle. We envisage a situation in which if SIB reports—nothing more—that an abuse is taking place or that something is going wrong, it will not have to go through the time-consuming, cumbersome and damaging procedure of going to court for an order. The amendment provides for an obligation to consult, which will be intrinsic to the relationship between the SIB and the SRO, but at the end of the day SIB should be able to say, "This is what's going wrong. Your rule 79 should be dealing with it but it's clearly inadequate. Change it and we'll argue about it later if necessary."<br><br>
I accept the argument about the nature of any subsequent application for judicial review. That would be a different kind of legal proceedings and would not interfere with SIB's ability to produce the immediate change in rule, which may be of the essence in some emergencies.<br><br>
I shall not repeat the arguments so well put by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield because they are already known. I emphasise that they are substantially and strongly endorsed by SIB and I hope that the Minister will find a way of accepting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the object of the amendment, and I intend to vote for it. It proposes that clause 12 be altered to allow the Secretary of State to consult and then to direct the organisation concerned. I agree that consultation is essential; indeed, I am surprised that it was not there in the first place.<br><br>
However, the tenor of the remarks that have been made—and this is implicit in the amendment—is that the Secretary of State will do all that. In practice, our objective is that the SIB should do it, which is entirely different. Indivisible as I understand the function of the Secretary of State to be, I do not believe that it includes being a designated agency. Perhaps someone can correct my impression, but if not, I believe that the drafting must be clarified so that we can achieve our real objective.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I intervene With regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), the powers would be transferable by the Secretary of State to the designated agency.<br><br>
It is perhaps unnecessary for me to rehearse the reasons why the Government took the view that it did in framing the powers of the designated agency over the SROs in the way in which they are set out. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) referred, during his constructive contribution, to the debate on Second Reading. The reasens why the Government favoured the balance between the powers of the self-regulating organisations and the powers of the designated agency were set out in the speech by my right hon. and learned Friend the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. We have always made it clear that it is a finely balanced issue, and one in which we are prepared to listen to the views expressed. My right hon. and learned Friend made it clear in an exchange with the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) during that debate that it raises no point of principle, and it is an issue on which there are powerful arguments on both sides.<br><br>
I have listened very carefully to what hon. Members have said, and it has not escaped my notice that the amendment put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has attracted a certain amount of support from my hon. Friends. The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford is one reason why I cannot undertake to accept the wording of the amendment. The amendment refers to the obligation to consult. The relationship between such an obligation and any power to intervene directly to order a rule change that may be entrusted to a designated agency is one of many matters that need careful consideration.<br><br>
However, I undertake to bring forward on Report an amendment which would give the Secretary of State the power, which he would be able to transfer to a designated agency, to direct a self-regulating organisation to alter, or himself to alter, the rules of a self-regulating organisation if those rules do not comply with the requirement in paragraph 3 of schedule 2 that they should afford investors protection at least equivalent to that afforded by the Secretary of State or the designated agency's own rules. The power to instigate the rule change would be there, but we need to consider the precise form that it should take.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He will appreciate that much will depend on the language used to define the question of who should be satisfied in relation to the point that he has made about compliance with the schedule. Can the Minister enlighten us further? It would clearly be unsatisfactory if the SIB or the Secretary of State were to be hamstrung in that crucial activity.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. The test could vary and according to whether the subjective test or a different test were to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0139">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
be aplied, the burden of proof would alter. That is a pre-eminent example of an issue that requires further thought, and on which we should like to consult.<br><br>
We have said that we could take into account what was said on the matter. We have done so. We have said that in principle we would be prepared to bring forward an amendment to the effect that I have summarised.<br><br>
As for the burden of proof and the precise test to be applied, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that this matter should not be the subject of instant decision, but of wide consultation. There is some anxiety about the other side of the argument.<br><br>
Views are not unanimous. The hon. Member for Yeovil, and my hon. Friends, are no doubt aware that the stock exchange favours the balance of power as originally enshrined in the Bill. We have accepted that the preponderance of view in the Committee requires a direct rule-changing power.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will bear with me if I say that on the details of the power, including what I recognise as important aspects such as the burden of proof, it would be wise to consult before reaching any final decision on the form that the power should take.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not in any way want to stop the Minister's deference to the revolt of the milk monitors, which is triumphing in his acceptance of the principle, but I should like to ask him one question about the balance of the argument.<br><br>
The stock exchange has said—probably publicly, but certainly in discussion with hon. Members—that if a provision of this kind is accepted, and if the role of the SROs is changed in this way, it will be difficult to get people of the requisite calibre and independence of view to serve on the SROs. Does the Minister see the amendment as having any effect on the willingness of people to serve on the SROs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point causes considerable anxiety and weighed in part with the Government when the original decision was taken to set the balance between the two organisations as it is in the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that that fear will prove misplaced. We have to draw a balance, take all relevant factors into account and decide how much weight to give to particular fears. I do not dismiss the hon. Gentleman's concern; I do not say that it is not a real anxiety, but I hope that in due course it will be found to be misplaced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the stock exchange a little over-worried about these issues? It has a great deal of experience in such matters, and it is likely that the SIB would never have to interfere, because of the high standard set by the stock exchange.<br><br>
We should really be dealing with the problems that may arise with the SROs that do not exist
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
today, and where there may be difficulties in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is extremely well taken, and it is as well to remember that we are concerned with a reserve power, which I am sure we hope would never be used. Whichever way the balance goes, the power is a reserve power which, if the system works well would never have to be resorted to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his interesting remarks and for the most interesting example of flexibility—I shall not use the word " concession " as that may be going too far—especially because I think that it sprang out of my intervention in the former Secretary of State's speech on Second Reading. I say that because I note that I used that very phrase, " reserve power ", in my intervention; indeed, I used almost the same terms as the Minister. Perhaps that is over-flattering my contribution, but it is nice to think that, although I am alone in the Committee, without great hordes of people behind me, I may win a victory now and again.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to take courage from his movement because he will recall that, on previous occasions, when we have asked him to take account of the concept of reserve powers, he has dismissed them in a cavalier fashion, and said that they were not required. He said that they were included in the Bill, could be dealt with adequately by a Minister of appropriate calibre, and could be argued in the courts, thereby providing a fatter return for some members of his profession. Those are not the Minister's reasons for the measure, but I ask him to take courage from conceding that, occasionally, reserve powers may be useful.<br><br>
I also ask the Minister to recognise that he has overturned the former Secretary of State's belief. If we were to set up the system which he is proposing, and exercise the power which he has conceded, we would not attract people of adequate calibre into the SROs. Let me quote the former Secretary of State's comments on the matter:
<br><blockquote><p>"The SROs will only work in the way we want if they attract people of calibre, integrity, experience and knowledge."— <i>[Official Report,</i> 14 January 1986; Vol. 89, c. 947.]</p></blockquote>
I suggest to the Minister, as I suggested to his right hon. and learned Friend, that SROs will attract such people only if the organisations are considered to fulfill a useful function and occupy a place within a meaningful framework. The reserve power will be beneficial and helpful in that respect.<br><br>
I do not wish to add to the arguments advanced cogently and eloquently by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), whose amendment is similar to mine. It is interesting to note that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggested that the hon. Gentleman's amendment was looser and weaker. Labour Members have been upstaged by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. That contrasts considerably with the rhetoric that they used on Second Reading, when they claimed that they were prepared to be tough here.<br><br>

My amendment goes slightly further, and is a little tougher than that proposed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, but it has one significant disadvantage and weakness, which I concede to the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) also touched on the matter. The hon. Gentleman's amendment deals with the important matter of consultation, and I hope that the Minister will accept his proposal. I support the hon. Gentleman in his amendment, and I hope that the Minister will take courage from that concession, and take it further, by attracting the appropriate calibre of people and strengthening the framework. I hope, too, that he will concede the idea of reserve powers, which may be useful for the future. I am delighted that the short intervention which I made on Second Reading has borne such considerable fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary said that he would consult me about amendments Nos. 134, 154 and 155. As that has a direct bearing on schedule 2, I hope that he will also consult me about redrafting the proposals in this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to make a serious point, but but also to comment on the remarks of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) about upstaging. I always listen with great interest to his comments on upstaging because, normally, he does it so well, but, on this occasion, he was less convincing than usual.<br><br>
The Minister has yielded to the logic and pressure from all sides in accepting the essence of the amendment. May I say—with all modesty—that I proposed that logic long before the Bill appeared. It was included in my Second Reading speech. I am willing to see the amendment, which is my modest attempt to secure that objective, replaced by an amendment that is fuller—but not necessarily stronger—and which has been drafted by SIB.<br><br>
The Minister warned us against making instant decisions. However, we have to decide whether to accept the Minister's assurances, or to press the amendment to a Division. The crucial question is not the Minister's general good faith and the nature of his intention. Instead, we need to know the circumstances in which the Secretary of State or the SIB can exercise that power. We need the Minister's direct assurance that his amendment will contain nothing on the nature of the burden of proof or about the criteria that the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account that would inhibit him or the SIB from using the full force of the power to insist on a change of rule where they consider such change necessary.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will wish to give us that assurance, because it is a negative assurance. We are not asking him to draft on his feet, but we want him to say in good faith that no attempt will be made to cut down the ambit of the amendment by weasle words. If the Minister can give us that assurance I am sure that his hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield will withdraw the amendment and that we shall all go away pleased.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can give such an open-ended assurance as the hon. Gentleman sug-the circumstances in which the power can be exercise that I intend to carry out.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would impose on the Secretary of State or the designated agency an obligation to consult before changing the rules. I have an obligation to consult before we set out the circumstances in which the power can be exercised and I do not believe that my consultations should be thus constrained.<br><br>
I see no reason why the fears that seem to lie at the heart of the hon. Gentleman's amendment should be well founded. They are misplaced. I prefer not to give the entirely open-ended assurances that the hon. Gentleman seeks, as they may lead to dissension and argument about their precise ambit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I encourage the Minister by saying that I am not directing his attention to consultation? I accept that some further elaboration of what is meant by consultation is required and that he must discuss such a provision.<br><br>
However, clever draughtsmen may say, "We have met the Minister's undertaking by a form of words that provides that in certain narrowly defined circumstances, and provided that the Secretary of State is totally satisfied that he has no other options," and many other conditions, " the Secretary of State can impose a change in the rules ". That would not be an adequate fulfilment of the Minister's undertaking.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us that he will not introduce an amendment against which that charge should be made? Provided that the Minister assures us that the amendment will be designed to achieve the general objective of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, we shall be happy. I cannot understand why the Minister should have any difficulty with such an assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There would be no intention of undermining the spirit behind the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members have no interest in trying to upstage anyone. We are concerned only with the merits of the argument. I am most grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for having recognised the merits of the argument.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the views of the stock exchange, with its great experience, but I accept the argument of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that the other SROs do not have that experience. I shall judge my hon. and learned Friend's amendment on the basis that it will place no fetter on SIB. I am less concerned with the subsequent legal action. I want SIB to have an unfettered power.</span></p>
<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i> Further consideration adjourned.—<i>[Mr. Donald Thompson],</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at one minute to One o'clock till Tuesday 18 February at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
