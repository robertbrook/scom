	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Latent Damage Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the Latent Damage Bill 	<i>[Lords]</i> the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—	<i>[The Solicitor-General.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful, Sir John to say now that the Opposition's attitude was set out carefully and thoroughly at Second Reading by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris). He made it clear that we welcome both the 24th report of the Law Reform Committee and this legislation, which is based on it. It therefore follows that we wish the Bill a safe, expeditious and speedy passage to the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's intention is to strike a balance between the rights of a plaintiff and the rights of a defendant but, as the Second Reading debate showed, there is some contention about whether the Bill does this. I believe that it does, but it is clearly right for the opposite view to be fully explored. Indeed, that is the whole point of a Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have welcomed a little more time to prepare my case on the amendment because of the complexity of the matter and the great concern that has been expressed by the contracting industry. In the last 24 hours I have received a 14-page letter from the Society of Construction Law, a 15-page letter from the Institution of Civil Engineers, a two-page letter from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and earlier a 26-page letter from the Institution of Civil Engineers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Bill has been in the Lords. Second Reading was a fortnight ago. It is no surprise to anyone, and I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman's worthy sorrow is quite irrevelant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir John, if you feel that I should have had more time to prepare, but I was just stating that I have received papers in the 24 hours since the composition and date of the Committee was announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say how important these matters are to the construction industry, which employs many hundreds of thousands of people and is of considerable importance to the economy. The Government have announced that they do not wish to burden industry unnecessarily. Indeed, I understand that deregulation units have been set up for the purpose of eliminating red tape and the imposition on industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General has not paid undue attention to submissions from the Consumers Association. Although it may speak for many millions of people, its knowledge of the construction industry is clearly limited, as indeed was that of the Law Reform Committee which produced the 24th report on latent damages which is the basis of the Bill. I understand that all the members of the Law Reform Committee are lawyers and that the Consumers Association does not include people from the construction industry, so we are faced with impositions from outside bodies which we feel are impracticable and liable to cause considerable difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the result of the Bill, if we are not careful, could be the opposite of what we are trying to bring about, because the imposition of a burden on the better contractors in the industry will cause their overheads to rise to the point where consumers may be tempted to purchase from jerry-builders who will not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
be around to implement the terms of a 15-year contract. So there may be more jerry-building as a result of the Bill than there is at present. That is one reason why I shall argue strongly that we should bear in mind the need for simplicity and certainty from the point of view of contractors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other place there was a long debate on these points and the noble lord Lord Hacking proposed amendments which covered a number of these points. A cry for simplicity was made then in the form of a general comment that an Act of this type has to be used by people in business and insurance as well as in the law and has to be readily comprehensible. Moreover, if proper insurance is to be provided, and this is essential, there must be sufficient certainty in the law to give an adequate background against which insurers can assess the risks involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal complexity concerns people who are practically involved in the construction industry. The drafting of the Bill is such that even lawyers well experienced in construction law have difficulty in understanding its meaning and significance. A number of peers complained of its complexity and obscurity, including Lord Denning, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Edmund-Davies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of particular concern are the complex provisions in new sections 14A(3) to 14A(9) which refer to the starting date for the three-year limitation period. The date depends on the results of a succession of tests that have to be applied to determine when the plaintiff first had sufficient knowledge of the facts to bring his action. The interpretation of these provisions and their application in practice will present great difficulty, and recourse to the courts is likely to be necessary on this account, let alone on account of the claim itself. These tests are based on those for personal injury contained in section 14 of the Limitation Act 1980 and it is not clear why this should be considered suitable for latent defects in the very different area of construction work or for the work of solicitors or accountants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the commencement date is of importance for the practical running of a business so that people know when they should date their papers. As someone who practises in the engineering contract industry, I am concerned that there may be difficulty in keeping sufficient records and having access to them. The burden on the industry will be considerable. At the moment people keep their records for six years. To be asked to keep records for 15 years will impose a massive constraint on an industry because most of the people will have moved to other occupations before 16 years is up, which will make it very difficult to look back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present law the date of accrual of a cause of action is when the damage occurs, whether the plaintiff was aware of it or not. This remains unchanged, and the six-year period within which an action must be brought runs from that date. Where the damage is latent, however, the plaintiff is also entitled to have three years in which to bring the action from the date when he is deemed to have knowledge of certain facts or material relevant to his claim according to the tests prescribed. The tests for determining this date are complex and uncertain and likely to give rise to difficulty. In some instances, it will also be necessary to determine the date of accrual. This may also pose
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
difficulties, but it is not clear just what "damage" means in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of a crack in concrete. Is the relevant date when this first happens but is invisible to the naked eye, when it can be seen and measured; or when it is of such magnitude that damp can penetrate and cause corrosion to the reinforcement steel within the concrete?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McWilliam 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaydon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that it is when whoever mixed it took the instructions to mix a weak batch or when whoever put the reinforcing rods in, either used rods that were too thin or did not allow them to weather sufficiently before they were put into the concrete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such matters are all uncertain after a period of 15 years. It also gives rise to the question of exactly who had knowledge of it, whether the contractor himself had knowledge of it or whether one of the workmen did this act, perhaps deliberately but without informing the contractor so that the contractor was not aware of it. Under the Bill the contractor could be held to have conspired in an act of deliberate concealment, one of the factors which gives us cause for great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of even greater importance are the difficulties likely to be met in determining the starting date for the 15-year cut-off period, which the Bill sets as the date of omission to which the damage is attributed. The first difficulty is that the date will have to be determined about 15 years after the alleged act or omission, by which time memories will have faded and the people involved and the records and other information may no longer be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second difficulty is in the meaning to be given to "act or omission" in the context of construction work. Using Lord Hacking's example, a breach of duty relating to the same defect might have occurred at various times, such as when the building was incorrectly designed, when, though designed correctly, the plans were drawn up, when the incorrect plans were submitted for tender, when the defect was incorporated, when the defect was not noticed during inspection or when the building was handed over as complete. To add to the complications, the act or omission might, by fact or allegation, be caused by various bodies—for example, the architect, engineer, main contractor or sub-contractor—or be shared among them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a question is likely to be difficult to resolve and might lead to mitigation in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative proposed by the construction industry and eventually put forward by Lord Howie and Lord Hacking in an amendment on Report is that the starting date for the 15-year cut-off period should be at the completion of the building. That is normally recorded as a matter of course in the form of a certificate, usually signed by the supervising architect or engineer. That would give a certain date which could be determined immediately from routine records. As Lord Hacking and others pointed out, other countries faced with the same problem use the completion date. As I understand it, within the EEC the accepted period is 10 years. The Bill is based on the Law Reform Committee's recommendations, but it seems from its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
report that it had inadequate understanding of the matter, as did many of the peers who opposed the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The uncompromising attitude in the letter that I received from the Consumers Association caused me great concern. It suggested that, if it could not have 15 years as it requested, it would not agree to anything. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General has not paid overdue attention to its attitude, because the construction industry will face the practical burden of implementing the provisions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the consumers will benefit from the proposals. The costs will have to be added to the initial purchase price, so that people will have to pay more for their homes than they would otherwise have had to do and less if they took out insurance separately at the end of a 10-year period rather than an excessive 15-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter that I have received from the Association of British Insurers says that it would have found a 10-year cut-off more practical than a longer one. I note that the building Neddy, the Economic Development Committee for the building industry, has still to make its comments on the Atkins Planning report, which it has had now for some months. Without assurance from the insurance industry, it is difficult to know how contractors will cover those risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not be fully appreciated that the insurance that can be obtained is relevant only for the period of the premium, so it is not possible for the person purchasing the property to know that he will have a contractor who is insured against events that might happen in 10 or 15 year's time. If the contractor ceases business or has not taken out adequate insurance policies, the purchaser may find that the whole matter is worthless when it comes to the test at a much later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that covers the main points that I wish to make on the amendments, but I hope that there will be an opportunity to clarify any points that other hon. Members may make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond briefly to the points made by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham). He mentioned representations. It is rather excessive for the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Society of Construction Law, and the Association of Consulting Engineers to give us their considered representations on this matter on the evening before the Committee was due to sit. I accept that the composition of the Committee was not known until last week, but the identity of the Opposition spokesman was known. It was posssible for us to have these representations in due time. The Consumers Association, which the hon. Gentleman criticised, managed to get its representations to us while the Bill was still in the House of Lords. In fairness to all these bodies, I must say that they all sent their representations to us before the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, whose views I found in my post 10 minutes ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggests that the Government might give undue consideration to the views of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Consumers Association. It is not my place to defend the Government, but the legislation that we are considering today is based closely on the recommendations in the 24th report of the Law Reform Committee on latent damage. The Government have not moved away from that to filter through their own views for the legislation. It follows very closely what the Law reform Committee recommended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that that committee consisted entirely of lawyers. They were seeking to strike a balance between legal niceties, without taking into account the practical burdens and considerations of those whose job it is to construct buildings, rather than look at the legal points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, and do not usually defend the interests of the legal profession on occassions like this. The Solicitor-General will agree that in this case the hon. Member is wrong to say that, because all the members of the Law Reform Committee are lawyers, they are bogged down in legal niceties and have not understood the wider import of what they are discussing. The Law Reform Committee did not say, "How can we refine legal niceties?" but, "How do we strike a balance between the needs of the plaintiff and the needs of the defendant?" In doing that, it has arrived, on the question of the longstop, at a period of 15 years. The committee avows to us that this strikes a balance. There is no reason why lawyers should be more on the side of the defendant than of the plaintiff. Nor can I see any possible way of arguing that 15 years is more expedient for lawyers than 10 or 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will accept that lawyers might be on their own side in regarding a 15 year period as more fruitful for litigation than 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East properly made the point about insurance. My right hon. and learned friend for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) referred to this on Second Reading. I find it difficult to accept that it would somehow be possible to get insurance if the longstop period were 10 years, and almost impossible if it were 15 years. The gap does not seem so unbridgeable. I accept that it affects the premiums, but that is a different issue.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
On the question of negligence, the hon. Gentleman, again perfectly properly, referred to the starting date. These are matters which are argued through in the courts, and he is wrong not to put sufficient stress on a point which underlines all this, and the current position in law. There has to be a case of negligence before any of the provisions apply. It is not as if the entire profession will have a cloud hanging over its shoulders. There must be cause of action before the longstop or anything else comes into play, even before arguments over commencement date come into play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to suggest what date a contractor should put on his documents to know how long they should be kept?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the date on the document will not necessarily save the contractor. The issue will be argued out, case by case, in the courts. That is exactly the position now. The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong in suggesting to the Committee that the Latent Damage Bill makes matters more convoluted. It is a difficult area of law under which the individual points and cases will always be right at the heart of whether there is a chance of an action or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as it is possible, this Bill lays down rules and sets the parameters of litigation. It does it very well and fairly, although I accept on the question of the longstop, that it is possible to argue whether it should be a shorter or longer period. That is a matter for debate. But it is not fair for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that somehow this makes matters worse rather than better. It does exactly the opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suffering as I was from a latent defect at the time of the Second Reading of the Bill, it was a matter of great regret that I was unable to be present in the House then. What I do know from that short but painful experience is that latent defects can be every bit as painful and damaging as patent defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I applaud the general spirit behind the clause which we are considering, although with some reservations. A new law should, if at all possible, meet at least three basic criteria. First, it should provide a balance of justice. Secondly, it should have clarity. Thirdly, it should be consistent with other laws on the same subject wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot criticise the balance of justice reached by clause 1. I wish to address some remarks to the clarity which is contained in clause 1 so far as litigants are concerned, and to whether that clarity may be improved if the spirit of some of the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) were incorporated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the clarity of clause 1, there is a problem in the meaning of the words "any potential plaintiff" in what will be new section 14A(5) of the Limitation Act 1980.1 will say no more about that as I am sure that we can rely upon the good sense of the hon. and learned Gentleman, the Solicitor-General, to deal with it in a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as it is thought to be amended by amendment No. 3, the clause is far from clear. Looking at the overriding limitation period which is provided for in clause 1 of the Bill, the problem is finding the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
starting point. If at all possible, the court should be put in the position of being able to put its finger on the starting point for the limitation period without having to conduct an exhaustive inquiry into facts. Exhaustive inquiries into facts become progressively more difficult as time passes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, an immense body of case law is concerned with the late bringing of claims for personal injuries. Over the years, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords have shown themselves to be ever more vigilant to ensure that cases are brought within a reasonable time. Clearly there must be exceptions to that principle. The Bill deals with one of the important exceptions to that principle and rightly so. But in the many cases on the late bringing of claims for personal injuries one of the matters to which the courts have frequently addressed themselves is the problem of recollecting precisely who did what at a particular time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience most cases in the courts, apart from the more arcane commercial disputes, tend to turn upon an issue such as who was standing at the bus stop at 5.35 pm on a certain day. They generally revolve around simple factual disputes. Although we may be talking in this context, with reference to the construction industry, about enormous building projects—the biggest and more important claims are likely to be about enormous building projects—we are not talking only about enormous causes of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about small contracts to build houses, agricultural buildings, workshops and the like. Whether we are talking about a large construction contract or a small construction contract under the clause as drafted the court is bound to be driven to examine all sorts of detailed facts which arise from conduct which may have occurred 15 years ago. The court will have to examine the acts or the omissions of architects, surveyors, clients, contractors and subcontractors. It is often difficult when considering subcontractors in building disputes even to ascertain who the sub-contractor was on a part of the contract, let alone what he did and when. Also tests of causation are included in the clause which talks about attributability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that it would be possible to introduce a test into the clause of far more certainty—as is suggested by amendment No. 3 tabled by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East. I am not sure that I agree with the 10-year period. I agree with the spirit of a 15-year period, if we could find a more certain way of identifying the starting date for the extended limitation period. I believe that could be done by taking the completion date of a building and the use of a time between 10 and 15 years would be just.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Building contracts generally take a considerable time. If one were to take two years as a reasonable period for the completion of the average building contract then if one had a longstop limitation period of 12 or 13 years from the date of completion of the building then one would not in any way be diluting the Bill's effectiveness. One would not be diluting the strength of the submissions which have been powerfully made by the Consumers Association. One would simply be making litigation easier, not only for defendants but for plaintiffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can glean support for this view from a number of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
speeches made in the other place. The hon. member for Bolton, North-East mentioned especially, Lord Hacking. Having read the Lord's proceedings I suspect that he is now known as Esau by most of his friends. In my view he made powerful points that were rather brushed aside by the Lord Chancellor, if I may say so with respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the issue of consistency. I appreciate that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must remind hon. Members of the Committee—I have been negligent myself—that they must not quote from speeches made in another place unless the Peer concerned is a Minister. I apologise to the Committee because I should have rumbled earlier an hon. Member who appeared to quote from the other place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlile</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir John. In fact, I have taken considerable care to summarise rather than to quote, but we shall bear in mind what you have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that the members of the Law Reform Committee were all lawyers. It would be churlish to criticise the Committee on those grounds, but I suppose that I would say that, would I not, being a lawyer myself? The members of that committee have considerable experience of dealing with the type of dispute with which we are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another place a number of noble Lords who are lawyers spoke. They also have great experience in dealing with disputes as counsel in years gone by and on the Bench in latter years. The other place heard particularly from Lord Denning, who, as Master of the Rolls for many years, had to deal with the most difficult problems of limitation of action. He, during the course of his speech in the other place, adverted to consistency which is my final point here this morning. He reminded the other place that the Defective Premises Act 1972 clearly provides that any cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued at the time when the dwelling was completed and that the period of limitation of 12 years under that Act runs from the date of completion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me surprisingly illogical that the Government should be seeking to adopt a different limitation period and also a different principle when considering the overriding limitation period in the context of the Bill. Although I have read carefully the speeches that were made on the Government side in the House of Lords there really is not an answer to the point made by Lord Denning—who in a few sentences put something which was put rather more lengthily by Lord Hacking. I hope that we shall hear a more convincing answer from the hon. and learned Gentleman this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to reconsider this point, not only from the view of the building and construction industries—for which I hold no particular brief, save that of an interested observer—but for plaintiffs too. I suggest that the completion date would be a more appropriate starting date. We have the precedent of the Defective Premises Act 1972 which adopted the same principle and, as was pointed out in the other place, we would bring our law into a closer relationship
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
with the laws of other countries within the European Community, especially those of France and Italy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Italy specifically they talk about "completion" and in France they talk about something called "acceptance" which is akin to completion. We have to bear in mind that nowadays, especially in London and the other great cities of England and Wales, many international developers are seeking to draw contracts which are as consistent as possible with the contracts which they draw in other jurisdictions. Consistency between the respective jurisdictions of the European Community would seem to me to be a virtue rather than a vice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to take a second bite of this, Sir John. I am willing to be guided by you. This is probably the appropriate point in our proceedings to invite the Solicitor-General to deal with the point about a potential plaintiff. I ask the Solicitor-General to deal with the submission by the Institution of Civil Engineers about the wording of new section 14A (3) and (4) 	<i>(b).</i> The interpretation by the institution or its advisers is probably one that it will not bear, but the Solicitor-General could set its mind at rest in a response to the Committee and could tell us whether the Government would consider introducing a slightly different wording on Report which might remove any ambiguity from the phase

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marples 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I say a few brief words before my hon. and learned Friend replies so that he can clear up the point in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that in his speech the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) mentioned three principles in considering new legislation—balance of justice, clarity and consistency with other law. But he made no mention of the effects that legislation may have on private sector costs and employment, and that is a consideration when we are dealing with consumer protection, though in a rather sophisticated guise. That must be balanced against any effects on the economy, production and employment, particularly at a time when the overriding concern of all of us in politics and public life, is with unemployment and the performance of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rather good practice has recently been introduced of noting on Bill their financial and manpower effects on the public sector. Every Bill must apparently now contain the Government's view of its effects on public expenditure and employment. But we have not yet reached the point, which we should encourage the Government to reach, especially because of their own concern with private sector expansion and production, of giving, with the publication of a Bill, estimates of the costs that it will impose on the private sector and whether those costs will have any effect on employment. We must take that into account and try to balance these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask my hon. and learned Friend a few specific questions along those lines. He may have perfect answers to all my questions and I may have nothing more to fear, but before posing those questions, perhaps I may give him an example of what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The House, with a good deal of all-party enthusiasm, recently passed the Data Protection Act. A few weeks ago our mutual hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment was a guest at a meeting of the business men in my constituency soon after the publication of the Department's White Paper "Building Businesses Not Barriers", in which the Secretary of State announced removal of some 80 regulatory and other blocks to business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A business man employing about 100 people in my constituency, an inner-city constituency with bad unemployment where all too few people are starting up building businesses, said to my hon. Friend: "It's all very well your Secretary of State publishing a White Paper like this, but a few months ago you enacted the Data Protection Act. Do you know what the consequences have been for my business—how many extra people I have to employ, how many extra records I have to keep?" The Under-Secretary's private answer was that he was very sympathetic, but his answer to me afterwards was, "We are having a battle with some other Ministries over this". I shall not name them here, as that might be invidious. But one Department sometimes seems to be pursuing the correction of what it sees as a fault in the way in which we conduct public affairs, while other Departments are trying to do something with which that is in direct conflict. I hope that in this case we are not building in substantial extra costs for the private sector, which are bound to show up in less output and probably in less employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has my hon. and learned Friend's Department, or the Government, had any consultations along these lines with business? Have they made any estimate of the additional costs that might be involved in record-keeping and, particularly, bearing in mind how difficult the indemnity insurance market is at the moment? Have there been any consultations between the Department or other Government agencies promoting the Bill and the Department's of Employment Trade and Industry? Do they believe that there is nothing to fear? If that is so, I have no fears, but I should like to know that this aspect of this type of Bill has been considered and that the Department of Employment and the Department of Trade and Industry have been invited to give their views and that those views are consistent with the line that my hon. and learned Friend is taking with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Patrick Mayhew) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the whole Committee will be grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) for having given us this opportunity to go into these matters at greater length and in greater depth than is possible in a Second Reading debate, although I thought that we had an interesting, if a trifle one-sided, debate that evening after 10 o'clock not long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that my hon. Friend has tabled have highlighted the understandable focuses of anxiety that are inevitable whenever one seeks to legislate in respect of irreconcilable interests. A potential plaintiff, a consumer, has an interest in not being denied his remedy in the courts for breach of the duty to take reasonable care towards him. An employer, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Maples) has just said, or a contractor, has an interest in knowing the limits of his liability in knowing when he is free from any liability for damages in respect of a breach of duty of which he may be wholly unaware. These two interests inevitably conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet it is not enough for Parliament to say, "It is all too difficult" or, "We have always done it like this, so we had better go on because at least the law is reasonably certain. The legislation, however inadequate, has been construed by the courts." We must do our best to reach a more equitable settlement, if that is possible. It is seldom possible on the initiative of Members of Parliament alone, simply because not enough of us have the necessary balanced, all-round knowledge. It is much more often possible where a committee charged with law reform and manned by people of distinction, experience and wisdom gives it as much time as they think they need. The Committee must agree that the present Bill is the product of such a committee and such a process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East was being lighthearted in the aspersions that he lightly cast on those responsible for the report. Of course they are lawyers, because the law of limitation of actions is regrettably complex. Almost inevitably it has to be if justice is to be achieved. Many of us think that it is too complex, but we have not been able to come up with any improvement. The Committee has a substantial guide towards the acceptability of the settlement that the Bill represents, and it is the product of three or four years' consisderation by the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is entitled to say that he has looked at the list of those on the Law Reform Committee and it does not seem to include a representative of the construction industry, and probably none of them has any practical experience of the construction industry. But that should not be said without reference to the appendix which contains the substantial list of bodies and individuals that were consulted by the committee. It deals with its consultation in paragraph 1.4, to which I shall do no more than refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the Lord Chancellor's Department has undertaken on its own behalf a considerable exercise in consultation. I shall not weary the committee with the whole list, but I shall mention some of the categories, other than the legal categories, of those who were consulted. Comments were received from 30 individuals or bodies in the building or construction industry. There were five representatives of architects, two of surveyors, nine of the construction industry,— for example, the Chartered Institute of Building Services—and 14 of the specialist engineering groups. This will be of great interest to my hon. Friend, with his personal experience. Many others were consulted in those categories from whom no comments were received—for example, eight bodies within the building, construction and engineering industries— which suggests that there was nothing outstandingly adverse to those interests, in their opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend accept that the view of most people in the construction industry, and I suspect of their customers, is that when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
they enter into a contract, the last thing that they want to think of is going to law? The shorter the period which any contractual obligations cover, the less likelihood there is of their ending in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that event—no doubt it is true, because nobody wishes to go to law—they should be profoundly grateful to the Lord Chancellor for introducing for the first time into the law, the overriding time limit which we call in shorthand the long stop. They know that under the present law there is no time limit on their liability in certain circumstances, but under the Bill there will be. This is an example of the balance that we have all sought to achieve, and agree has to be achieved. It is the foundation for the Government's approach to the Bill, and ought to be the foundation for our own approach. It deals with the point made by my hon. Friend about the need to keep records, and the inconvenience that goes with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the other side of the coin? As the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) said, people in the construction industry do not have to start considering the applicability of the Bill unless and until there has been an act of negligence in connection with what they have provided or done. What is negligence? It is the breach of the duty to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances to any person whom one knows or should reasonably foresee will be affected by one's actions or omissions. The tort of negligence, and the cause of action for negligence, arise only when there has been that breach of duty, coupled with harm or damage that has resulted from it. Only then does any of this argument arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider consumers—we prefer to regard them as our constituents—we have to ask if it is right that the interests of the construction industry, for example, should predominate to an unbalanced degree over the interests of our constituents. Those who provide these services know, or ought to know, more about the technicalities than do the consumers, our constituents. I hold to the belief that we have to provide a reasonable degree of protection for our constituents, just as we have to provide a reasonable degree of certainty for the private sector, which my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Maples) rightly reminded us is so important. That is what we have sought to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first raft of amendments which have been conveniently grouped together reduces the long stop period from 15 years to 10 years. There is no magic figure. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) said that he would prefer 12 to 13 years, and that the starting point should be the date of completion. I cannot say to the Committee that 15 years is self-evidently better than 12 or 13 years. It is a very narrow margin. I can say that the Law Reform Committee after substantial consultation, concluded that on balance 20 years would be too much—for which the consumers asked—that 10 years would be too little, and that 15 years met the justice of the case. I cannot assist the Committee by developing that argument, because it is not capable of development. We should be guided by the Law Reform Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that we decided on 10 years. In some cases a 10-year long stop would bite not long after the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
expiry of the ordinary six-year time limit, measured from the date of accrual. It might even bite before the damage occurred or was discovered. We should, then, accept 15 years, and I hope that the Committee will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming to the second raft of amendments, which deal with the completion date rather than the breach of duty date as the starting point, I shall deal with the point raised by both the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, about the words "any potential plaintiff" in the proposed section 14A(5) of the Limitation Act 1980. I shall do so very briefly, though not out of any desire to suggest that this is a superficial issue. There are two points—the concept of reasonable discoverability of the defect, and the concept of actual knowledge that something has gone wrong. It is our intention that reasonable discoverability shall apply in the case of a plaintiff bringing an action himself. We do not intend to saddle such a plaintiff with the state of knowledge of another plaintiff. That is distinct from the concept of that which is reasonably discoverable. There is an element of doubt from the use of the expression "any potential plaintiff" in the context of proposed new section 14A(5). There must be, because speeches were made to that effect by distinguished speakers in another place. If it meets the Committee's convenience, I shall leave this for the time being, with the assurance that, if the Government believe it necessary to clarify that provision, we shall come forward with such a provision at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I thank the Solicitor-General, and say that I am satisfied that that is the right way of dealing with this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. Now I come to the second raft, of amendments which deals with the start of the long stop period. The Bill, following the Law Reform Committee's recommendation, says that breach of duty is the time to start. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery says that it should be from the date of completion. The first point to make clear is that those who are concerned with the ultimate limitation of the liability of a potential defendant—a contractor—should realise that in many cases they will be liable, or at risk, for much longer if the date of completion is adopted, breach of duty may precede date of completion in large contracts by a number of years, and that must be remembered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally important is the fact that the date of completion is not always easy to discern. The Bill applies not just to the construction industry, but to anybody who provides advice, and anybody who is guilty of a breach of any duty giving rise to damage other than personal injury. It is not easy to discern. If I needed authority for that—as I do for practically every proposition in this minefield of the law—it is common knowledge that the Official Referees see many difficulties in the adoption of the date of completion as the starting point for this calculation. In some civil engineering projects, under period contracts, there is a practice of contracts renewable on an almost infinite basis and difficulties are envisaged. In some civil engineering projects, on a common contractual basis,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
it would be difficult to establish the completion of one project and beginning of another. That is where renewability is built into the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sufficient to say in support of the Committee's recommendation that amongst the Official Referees, who have the unenviable task of coping with this type of case month in and month out, there are considerable reservations about substituting the date of completion for the date of breach of duty. We should be guided by that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The official referees said when consulted by the Lord Chancellor's Department, that since completion turned on matters of fact, there could well be room for argument on the point. Breach of duty is absolutely central, as I have said, to the whole conception of negligence. It is absolutely central to it. One cannot establish negligence, a claim cannot be put on its feet, unless negligence is shown. One cannot show negligence without first showing breach of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties of determining the date of breach of duty have been considerably overstated. Therefore, on these matters I hope that the Committee will feel it can adopt the scheme in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say one word on the EEC product liability directive which has been mentioned. Legislation to give effect to that will be brought forward when parliamentary time allows. It is an unreliable analogy. The 15-year long stop is a period of limitation in cases of negligence. The 10-year period under article 11 of that directive is a period of prescription, after which rights under the directive, based on a regime of strict liability, become extinguished. The limitation period in respect of rights under the directive is, in fact, one of three years, provided by article 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery mentioned the law in France. In France, the 	<i>code civil</i> provides that architects and builders are liable for defects in buildings for 10 years from acceptance of the building, and the main contractor will be obliged to make good the damage. This is more onerous than the Latent Damage Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken so long, but I do so out of respect for the many useful briefing documents which have been circulated, and out of recognition that these are difficult issues in respect of which it is quite impossible to say that it is self-evident that one particular solution is better than another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This package represents the best views of the Law Reform Committee. The Lord Chancellor, after considerable consultation of his own, considers, along with the Law Reform Committee, that it represents in the round the best general package available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If one considers members of the Consumers Association as one's constituents, obviously the members of the construction industry who are also one's constituents are in a minority, perhaps a minority who feel that they have a more practical understanding of some of the

implications which the Bill is bringing to bear on their industry and the costs which they will have to pass on to consumers. I did not hear my hon. and learned Friend answer the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Maples) on what costs would be put on the private sector and the effect of employment on the private sector. That is really the nub of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in the construction industry are still confused over the question of the start date. They are unhappy that the official referees should be sticking to the breach of duty date, regardless of the fact that there are differences when one is looking at the completion of a building. It is usual to regard completion certificates as setting a definite date and I ask my hon. and learned Friend to consider yet again the options for having a split so that the breach of duty date applies to all cases except buildings for which completion certificate could be used as the valid start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of the Bill is to introduce an element of certainty and simplicity, and that is one which would be especially welcomed by the construction industry.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal in the amendment is what the industry wants and understands. It conforms with normal practice, is easy to record, is certain and can also be used as a basis for insurers. But the breach of duty clause alone is imprecise, both in law and in fact. How, in heaven's name, are contractors to sort out 15 years after the event whether the relevant date was when the building was incorrectly designed, when, although designed correctly, the plans were wrongly drawn, when the incorrect plans were submitted for tender, when the defect was incorporated, when the defect was not noticed during inspection or when the building was handed over as being complete? This would need litigation to resolve, and it is on that very count that we feel strongly that we should press the amendment to the attention of my hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the Law Reform Committee, I do not think that its members are sufficiently familiar with the basic practices of the industry. Although they may well have consulted, the result of their deliberations shows that they did not truly comprehend the nature of the difficulties which will face the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend's indulgence only to remedy the omission of not dealing with my other hon.

I have pointed out that the introduction of an overriding time limit will be an advantage, but no one can say, although these were matters upon which there was an opportunity for all who were consulted to express opinions.

The question of insurance is the subject of a separate exercise by the building EDC, which in March 1984 appointed an insurance feasibility steering committee to investigate the desirability and feasibility of latent defects protection insurance for new commercial, industrial and other non-housing building and to make recommendations. I referred at Second Reading to the consequences of that. Also, the Royal Institute of

	<div class='title'>PROVISIONS CONSEQUENTIAL ON SECTION 1</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 4, leave out lines 20 to 25 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5) Subsections (1) and (2) above shall not apply to the periods of limitation prescribed in sections 14A and 14B of this Act.'.</p></blockquote>
We are dealing here with the question of deliberate concealment which has also been a cause of considerable concern within the industry. I begin by referring my hon. and learned Friend to the reply that he gave on Second Reading when, in the course of an intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mr. Chapman), who at one time practised as an architect, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most of these cases amount to a breach of duty which is not deliberate."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 11 June 1986; Vol. 99, c.450.]</p></blockquote>
That is a point on which I have to disagree with my hon. and learned Friend. The case which has been put to me by the industry is that that will give rise to great confusion. Although some cases will be like this, in construction most cases will tend to be in the category of a deliberate commission of a breach of duty. I shall attempt to show why this is so. The point is
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
fundamental, and it is again a matter that I feel the Law Reform Committee did not properly appreciate or understand in its report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(2) of the Bill excludes the provision of new sections 14A and 14B where there has been deliberate concealment of any fact relative to the plaintiff's right of action. On the face of it, that is reasonable, but not when one realises that "deliberate concealment" is defined in section 32(2) of the Limitation Act 1980:
	<br><blockquote><p>"deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty."</p></blockquote>
In the context of construction work, the majority of defect cases will fall into this category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes nonsense of the Bill as it stands, for it means that the provisions of new sections 14A and 14B will not apply in such cases, which means that the criterion by which such cases are decided will, by reason of section 32(1), be that of discoverability, with the uncertainty that that involves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee referred to this in paragraph 4.20 of its report and advanced two arguments in support of its recommendations: that it would be against conscience to allow a person to take advantage of such behaviour, this being lumped together as "fraud, deliberate concealment and mistake", and that of those who they had consulted few had suggested that there should be a change in the provisions of section 32. Both arguments sound very fine on the face of it, though less so when one looks more closely at the issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the conscience argument first, in construction the deliberate concealment is unlikely in most construction cases to be the act or omission of the principal himself who is being sued. It is more likely to be that of an employee, and the principal may well know nothing about it at the time or indeed ever after until the defect manifests itself and he receives a claim. An argument based on conscience therefore hardly applies for, in so far as the principal is liable, it would be through the principle of vicarious liability, which is a feature of social convenience rather than moral law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regard the second argument, it is only valid if the bodies consulted were aware of the special meaning attached to "deliberate concealment" or had it drawn to their attention. That was not so in the case of at least two important bodies in the construction industry and accordingly it is doubtful whether any weight should be given to that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useful to list possible examples of latent defects in construction work and consider the extent to which they would fall into the category covered by section 32(2): (a) poor ground conditions, (b) foundations design inadequate, (c) improperly constructed foundations, (d) building structure design inadequate, (e) reinforcement omitted in R C work, (f) welded and bolted connections inadequately executed, (g) harmful components in concrete, (h) inadequate cladding supports or fixings, (i) inadequate protection of buried pipelines, (j) inadequate joints buried in pipelines, (k) inadequate design against fatigue failure, (1) blocked or leaking drainage systems, (m) inadequate ventilation of timber work, and (n) inadequate design of chimney and flue duct linings. Some of these would be design defects, some construction defects and some could be both. If he has responsibility for inspection on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
site, as is usually the case, the consulting engineer or architect may have liability in regard to construction as well as design.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases involving such examples, the plaintiff should be able to invoke subsection 32(2) and so break the 15-year cut-off provisions. It should be noted that it is not that the defaulting designer or contractor, or their employee, has necessarily set out deliberately to conceal the defect but that the work, either by its very nature or by the requirements of the design, is such that concealment is virtually inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Hacking raised this matter of deliberate concealment in his amendment No. 15 which sought to exclude the effects of subsections 28(1) and (2), and he was supported in this by Lord Wilberforce who had raised the matter earlier. The Lord Chancellor resisted this amendment but did not, in his response, answer the basic point made by both Lord Hacking and Lord Wilberforce that latent defects in construction would, by their very nature, be caught by section 28(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of defending such a case as long as 15 years or more after the event would be formidable. Not only may records have been lost or destroyed but the people concerned with the work may have dispersed or have died. Even when they are found, it may be difficult to arrange for them to do the necessary studies and research, quite apart from the difficulties inherent in such work. Moreover, the physical conditions of the site may have changed since the design was done or the works constructed, and this may have caused or contributed to the defect and, in addition, standards and methods of working may have changed, yet it may be difficult to demonstrate this so long after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If most latent defect cases in construction are of the type where section 32(2) can be invoked, the 15-year cut-off provision will be of little or no value as a means of obtaining insurance or reasonable terms of providing security for retired or professional people or others similarly situated in the construction industry. Moreover, it means that the very principle of the Bill whereby a compromise is provided between plaintiff and defendant is being set at nought: the 15-year cut-off is being offered with one hand and taken away with the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to be noted that ruling out deliberate concealment would not mean that a defendant escaped in the event of fraud or mistake, both of which are also covered by section 32(1). Fraud would constitute a separate cause of action and likewise mistake, which would be an action in contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These points bear out the fact that the consultations carried out by the Law Reform Committee do not seem to have got through to the practical matters which those in the industry feel are so relevant. Clause 2(2) excludes the provisions of new sections 14A and 14B where there has been deliberate concealment of any fact relative to the plaintiffs right of action. On the face of it, this is reasonable, but not when one realises that "deliberate concealment" is defined in section 32(2) of the Limitation Act 1980 as I have already outlined in my submission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These points are fundamental and not ones which those in the industry feel can be overlooked or
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
dismissed as being just a question of finding the right number of years in which to seek a balance. The problems escalate with the number of years out of proportion just to adding one, two or three more years. They reach the point where one can defend a case or consider the merits of a case reasonably easily, but find it extremely difficult to do so because staff are no longer available to cast their minds back to the points at issue so many years erlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by referring to Lord Wilberforce's speech, although I appreciate that not all the points that he made can be quoted directly. There is the legal background because, in section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980 based on section 26 of the 1938 Act, it is intended also to take account of how the courts had come to interpret this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1939 Act referred to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"right of action being concealed by fraud"</p></blockquote>
though, in the way it was applied, the word "fraud" was used not in its literal and severe sense but in the sense of someone knowingly and recklessly doing something wrong in the circumstances where it was unlikely to be discussed. An element of blame attaches to the defendant beyond that associated with the wrong itself, though it is not necessary that he took active steps to conceal the wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of concern that the nature of construction work is such that the majority of latent defects would seem to fall, as a matter of course, into the category of deliberate concealment, as defined by section 32(2). A list of examples can be given and, as can be seen, the defects would be concealed either by their very form or by the due execution of the work that followed. As far as is known, the courts have not yet been called upon to give an interpretation of section 32(2), so one does not know whether they will seek to escape from the literal interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In William Hill v. Bernard Sunley the Court of Appeal commented on the argument that covering up in the due successsion of construction work did not, in itself, constitute fraudulent concelament but it qualified this by referring to the importance of the defect and the existence of a special relationship between the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Unfortunately, there was not sufficient time available for me to appraise myself of this matter. I was fascinated to hear my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General refer to this as a legal minefield. Not being a lawyer myself, I hesitate to tread in this area, but it is of such great concern to those in the industry that I feel I should not be doing my duty to the causes which they have represented to me if I did not take the Committee through the issues that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was discussing vicarious liability and was pressing the point that the principal would necessarily have been idle in failing to be aware of the defect. It is in the nature of construction work that it is carried out under conditions where it is not feasible to control and check every operation. In these respects it differs fundamentally from factory work, where close regulation is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that this matter of deliberate concealment is best dealt with in the manner proposed by Lord Hacking in the other place under his amendment No. 15. This amendment is repeated later in my argument and is the preferred amendment. If this is not acceptable, it is suggested that another amendment be introduced to cover the effect of vicarious liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be noted that this amendment would only relate to the 15-year cut-off; up to that time, the effect of the Bill would be unchanged. It is also to be noted that the principle of vicarious liability, as it relates to the substantive law, would be unchanged. The proposed amendment relates to the procedural law and turns on whether the principal had knowledge of the act or omission. In this sense, it is submitted, it is entirely in keeping with the arguments adduced by the Law Reform Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly describe some examples of situations in which this difficulty arises. Four cases might arise as follows: first, where the contractor perpetrated a defect in the course of construction work; secondly, where the architect or engineer failed to notice this in the course of his inspection work; thirdly, where the designer perpetrated a defect in his design that subsequently incorporated in the works, and, fourthly, where a local authority approved a design containing a defect which was subsequently incorporated or failed to notice the defect in the course of inspection at site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases the roles under the second and third examples will be performed for the promoter of the works, though, in some cases, the contractor will be responsible for both design and construction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give an example of the difficulties we are talking about. Let me take as an example an industrial storage building, with reinforced concrete floor slabs. Sixteen years after the building is completed, one of the floors is loaded with heavy boxes and, under this load, sags and cracks. It is found that the main reinforcement is ¾" diameter steel bar whereas calculations show that 1" diameter is necessary for such a load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The building owner produces a drawing from the time of construction which shows 1" diameter bars and
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
sues the contractor for negligence. He also alleges deliberate concealment and thereby seeks to avoid the 15-year cut-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first comment is that this well illustrates the problems of defending a claim so long after the event. The defect in the floor speaks for itself, but the circumstances under which the particular reinforcement came to be used are hidden in time. The men who worked on the site will have dispersed widely, not only in this country but perhaps abroad, and, in any case, those who constructed the slab will not be identifiable, and the contractor's manager may well have left for another company, likewise, the architect's staff will probably have dispersed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various reasons may account for the ¾" diameter bar being used. For example, there may have been a drawing showing this diameter of bar to which the contractor rightly worked which was subsequent to that at which the owner is now looking. For the sake of argument, however, let us assume a reason where the contractor is at fault due to a wrong doing by his charge-hand and workmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charge-hand will have been given a drawing showing the steel reinforced to be incorporated in the slab. He finds that the supplier has delivered ¾" bar instead of the 1" bar shown on the drawing. The work is behind programme and he takes it on himself to decide to use the ¾" bar. He knows he is doing wrong and that he should refer the matter to his boss, but he persuades himself that it will probably not matter. There is no doubt that this was a negligent act and that it was deliberately done in circumstances in which it was unlikely to be discovered for some time. His boss knew nothing about it and, had he known, he would have stopped it or had it rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, the reinforcement would have been checked by the architect's or engineer's inspection staff prior to the concreting of the slab. We do not know why this was not done on this occasion, but perhaps the inspector was distracted or arrived late or was otherwise absent for some reason. Again, the Partner-in-charge knew nothing about it and, had he known, would have stopped it or had it rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an alternative reason, one might assume that someone in the architect's or engineer's office made an error in the design and specified ¾" instead of 1" diameter bars on the drawing and that, for some reason, this error escaped the checking process. Again, the partner-in-charge knows nothing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar reason could arise in regard to the local authority referred to separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential point of these examples is that the negligent act was one which would normally have qualified for the 15-year cut-off. Just as the plaintiff gets the benefit of the extension beyond the 6-year period from the accrual, by virtue of the new section 14A, so the defendant gets the benefit of the 15-year cut-off. This compromise is the fundamental basis of the Law Reform Committee's recommendations. One is not condoning the act or omission; one is simply saying that there should be a reaonable balance between the interests of the two parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This balance is being upset and the compromise is being destroyed by the introduction of an artificial concept which has little relevance in construction
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
work. In a solicitor's office, where the principal is much more closely involved in the detailed work, it may be that deliberate concealment would be unlikely without his knowledge or involvement and that he is more likely to be concerned in the act or omission. Consequently, on the rare occasions on which this happens, it may well be reasonable to deny him the benefit of the cut-off. But in construction work, in the first place, the principal generally will not be aware of the negligent act and, in the second place, such concealment as may have taken place will generally have been in the natural course of the construction work and in no way something which the principal prompted or at which he connived. In such circumstances it is unreasonable that the provisions of subsection 32 should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions only apply by reason of the principle of vicarious liability. But this is a legal principle prompoted by social convenience rather than by moral reasons and is consistent with the conscience argument adduced by the Law Reform Committee in paragraph 4.20 of its report to support the application of section 32.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ryman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but surely the crux of the matter that he is arguing at inordinate length and with great ingenuity is that it is difficult for a defendant to defend an action long after the event, because evidence is stale, witnesses cannot be found, and so on. Is he not also saying, again with great ingenuity, that it is unfair to place the construction industry in the same position as, for example, a firm of solicitors, because the concealment could take place without the knowledge of the principal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's experience in the construction industry, but why should it be placed in a more favourable position than anybody else being sued for negligence, such as a firm of solicitors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That illustrates exactly the point that I am trying to make to distinguish between types of contract with which lawyers may be much more familiar and construction projects which, by their nature, are far larger and where the principal cannot be looking at everything that is happening all the time. That is why in the earlier amendments I suggested that there should be two different clauses—one specifying for a building that it should be dated from completion, because the construction of a large building is different and one has to look at the practicalities of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in this area that I have such reservations and doubts about the way in which the Law Reform Committee studies the practicalities of constructing and completing large projects and the way in which responsibility for them should be laid on those in the industry who are endeavouring to produce buildings and other construction work and at the lowest possible cost to consumers. Ultimately they are acting in the interests of consumers and if we load on them a law which is felt to be merely an encumbrance and an added complication, costs on the consumers will rise. I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's point about the difference between a large construction site and a solicitor's office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Hacking's amendment adopts a broad-brush
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
approach and rules out the application of section 32(l)	<i>(b)</i> altogether. This would mean that, in the rare instances where the principal as defendant was aware of the act or omission and thus privy to concealment, he would nevertheless benefit from the 15-year cut-off. For simplicity and greater certainty, both of which are important for insurance reasons, and bearing in mind that the cut-off is part of a compromise, the amendment seems preferable. If it is not accepted, the alternative amendment based on the principle of being unaware should be adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the gist of what I wish to say. I hope that the Committee will now realise that the difficulties that arise for the construction industry are different from the many other activities with which the lawyers on the Committee may be more familiar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Ground 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Feltham and Heston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause appears to contain a number of important effects upon the way in which disputes about the application of the 15-year limitation period are conducted. This form of limitation clause will plainly give rise to many disputes on questions of fact involving mistakes, upon which large sums of money depend and which are the reverse of trivial or pernickety. The same applies to the 15-year limitation period which the Committee considered in relation to the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend rightly paid considerable regard to the views of the Official Referees in considering what action the Government should take on these matters. But I want to ask him whether, in connection with the clause and the 15-year limitation period generally, he has considered the impact on the jurisdiction of the Official Referees. In addition to the views which he has expressed from the Official Referees, he is no doubt aware of their view that there should be an appeal on questions of fact as well as on questions of law. Can he give us some form of assurance that the effect of the clause on the jurisdiction of the Official Referees will be considered by the Government, and any necessary procedural and jurisdictional changes made, so that full consideration can be given to the views of the Official Referees concerning their jurisdiction on questions of fact?

Will the Government consider whether the imposition of this type of legal problem requires some amendment of the existing powers of the Official Referees, so that in effect they will have the powers of a High Court judge, so that the Court of Appeal, when considering appeals from Official Referees, will be able to have appeals on some questions of fact, rather than the present situation in which no appeal on a question of fact from the Official Referee is permissible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely correct, and would be known to hon. Members of the House and to the professional lobbyists. I do not want to say more on that point. It was raised, but is not the substance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments and issues which we are discussing concern two points, concealment, and the difficulties that time presents in dealing with concealment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East that the professions cannot have it both ways. They say to the consumer that the fees that they charge, and their involvement in the work, are to ensure that the consumer is protected by having the job overseen, or the service presented—as we are speaking not only of the construction industry but of other industries and professions involved as well— and the consumer benefits from having the involvement of a professional. The consumer is entitled to expect that he has received a professional service, not just a job done by a workman. For the profession on the other hand to argue that its position should be protected in our society, that there should be self-regulation, and then to say that it does not wish to come under the legislation because it makes life very difficult for it—in other words the consumer's right in law be put back— seems very much like trying to have the cake and eat it as well. That is not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The hon. Gentleman said three times that just because the Law Reform Committee disagreed with the point of view he was advocating, somehow it had not considered the issues properly, is a bit much. It is perfectly proper to say that it has arrived at different conclusions from his own, but that is quite different from saying its job was done in a negligent way. The hon. Gentleman has made that point three times. He should not keep making it. We understand his view on it, but is is not tenable. When I have my arguments with the Solicitor-General, as I often do, I do not say to him that he does not have his point of view properly thought out. He always has. I often say I disagree with it, but that is quite different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the hon. Gentleman accept that many of the people in the construction industry who were consulted would not have been lawyers themselves who perhaps fully understood the meaning of some of these words? On deliberate concealment, there was a case in point where two of the professional bodies felt that they did not understand the point put to them at the time of the Law Reform Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now saying that the professional associations have not been properly advised. I am not sure that that is a point of view that the professional associations would want him to advocate on their behalf in Committee. I do not accept what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has treated the Committee with details of difficult cases. It is perfectly right to do so, but the conclusion he seems to draw from this is that, because a case is difficult, we should somehow alter the law so that it cannot be brought. That does not seem fair to the consumer at all. He points out some of the issues which will probably be raised. It is very proper to point them out, but it is perfectly proper that these matters should be raised and tested in court, and that the court or the Official Referee should do their best to make a judgment on the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, something has been buried in the ground, the onus should not be put on the consumer, the person who would probably be the plaintiff, to dig it up again and check that it had been done properly or to make holes in the concrete to see that what is embedded in it, ought to be embedded in it. The consumer is entitled to rely upon the supervisory functions of the professional who has been engaged to do exactly that and, as soon as it can be reasonably discovered that that professional function is not being carried out properly, to have some legal remedy in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Ryman) quite concisely asked why the hon. Gentleman was arguing that the building industry should have some special exemption which was not available to other professions, and that point was not satisfactorily met. In this matter, I am a supporter of the Bill as it stands and therefore find myself on the same side as the Solicitor-General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving late in the Committee and will speak very briefly, dealing with three points. First, reference has been made to the Official Referees. I feel very sorry for the Official Referees because they have terrible cases in front of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
them. Happily, the majority of them are settled. They go on for days. I know of a case which lasted three days involving one pair of trousers which had been damaged at a dry cleaner's. It was eventually settled on the morning of the fourth day. We are familiar with Scotch schedules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the suggestion made by the hon. Gentleman about the extention of the powers of the Official Referee's court as to appeal on a finding of fact. It seems to be imminently sensible if the judgment of the Official Referee involves a finding of fact, because very often, when the plaintiffs and defendants agree, the agreement is set out in the record of the Official Referee's court. That is a very good suggestion, and I support it. I also feel sorry for Official Referees because they have an onerous task. They do not have the status or the facilities of High Court judges, but they have a great deal of detailed and difficult work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal next with whether the construction industry, for the various reasons that have been put forward, occupies a position different from other legal entities in law with respect to periods and actions for negligence. It is argued very persuasively—and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) for doing so—that, because of the difficulties of the construction industrys, it should have a position of favouritism in law by reason of the fact that defects cannot be reasonably discovered, even if there is close supervision, and vicarious liability involves the impugning of the liability of negligence upon an employer in those circumstances. I am not persuaded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no logical reason why the construction industry, albeit with all its difficulties, should be placed in a position of favouritism in the law generally. We have masses of negligent solicitors. Although I take the point about closer supervision, it is very difficult for a partner in a large firm of solicitors—and solicitors' firms these days are very large indeed—to find out what some legal executive has been doing on a particular matter, and if the client suffers as a result of that legal executive's negligence it is right and fair that the principal of the firm should be liable, and the Law Society has recognised that by its insurance scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's complaint about the doctrine of vicarious liability. He seems to be saying that the site manager, architect or engineer should not be liable because some workman has done something without reference to him on the spur of the moment, and it seems a bit unfair if, years later, as a result of the workman acting in that way, the architect or engineer should be liable. I do not understand that argument at all. The essence of vicarious liability is that there is liability by the principal for the acts of his servant or agent. Unless the hon. Gentleman seeks to change the law, I do not understand the logical base of his argument in that respect. There is a great deal to be said for what Lord Wilberforce said in the other place about having a doctrine of strict liability, which would deal with many of these problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Committee is indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) for bringing foward the amendment and for the care with which he addressed himself to it. The Committee was probably less
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
persuaded by his contention that the doctrine of vicarious liability was a matter of social convenience rather than moral right than by some of his other submissions. For reasons that have just been touched upon by the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Ryman), that proposition is difficult to sustain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a real problem here, not only in the construction industry but in many areas where a duty of care is owed by one person to another. The consequences in terms of damage resulting from breach of that duty to have care, from failure to come up to the required standard, do not become apparent, do not indeed occur, until many years have gone by. In the Bill, we have for the first time introduced the long stop. No matter how serious, if it does not occur until 15 years have gone by, that is bad luck to the plaintiff and the defendant gets away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having done that, are we to insist that that bad luck for the plaintiff must be sustained, even where the cause of the damage is the deliberate commission of the breach of duty? I ask my hon. Friend to distinguish between the deliberate doing of the act and the deliberate commission of the breach of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has already been cited to the Committee that passage in the report which the Law Reform Committee says that something more in terms of culpability is involved. Paragraph 4.20, referring to section 32 of the 1980 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The essential feature of the section is that it is based on some degree of responsibility on the part of the defendant beyond his mere failure to comply with his legal obligations, and the traditional view taken by the courts of such conduct is that it would be 'against conscience' to allow a defendant to take advantage of such behaviour by lapse of time."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne East (Mr. Brown) was educated in Tunbridge Wells, which no doubt played some small part in the fact that he is good at his job. There is a railway tunnel in Tunbridge Wells constructed by Victorian contractors in a very slipshod and jerry-built way. Instead of there being three layers of bricks there are only two—or it may be one instead of two. It was very many years before that fact became apparent, and as a result until recently special railway rolling-stock was necessary to get through the tunnel. That was a deliberate commission of breach of duty—Albeit a contractual duty, I hasten to say, and not duty in the sense of the law of negligence. I think that anybody would be reluctant to concede a long-stop defence to somebody who deliberately—with fraud or with any other brand of culpability in mind—deliberately committed a breach of duty. That was what the Law Reform Committee had in mind: it is against conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite see the effect of the law of vicarious liability, but, when one comes to think of it, most contractors for whom my hon. Friend speaks are corporations of one kind or another. Although there are one-man bands, more frequently it is a company, and a company is liable for the acts or omissions of those whom it employs, so long as they act in the course of their employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East rightly points to the difficulty of establishing after, let us say, 15 years what actually happened. Very well; but that is a burden that the plaintiff—the customer, the client—will have to discharge. If the client is seeking to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
bring his action outside the 15 years—the longstop period—he will have to say, "I am entitled to do this. Look at this provision of the Act. It says that if there has been deliberate concealment, I am not bound by the 15 years". But what a burden that will be. To the extent that it is difficult, it is an increasing burden upon the plaintiff, and the defendant or potential defendant will not have the burden of showing on the balance of probability that he did not conceal: the boot will be on the other foot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although the clause rightly gives rise to close scrutiny, and indeed, anxiety, I do not believe that it is an unjust or inequitable thing that the Bill seeks to achieve by this provision. I agree that we must be satisfied that it achieves what it is seeking to achieve, and the draftsman will have full opportunity to consider what has been said in this regard by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on reflection my hon. Friend will feel able to seek to withdraw the amendment. To encourage him to do so, perhaps in conclusion I may say this. One effect of his amendment is that in some cases of deliberate concealment—where the plaintiff discovers facts about the damage within the 15-year period—the plaintiff would be worse off than under the present law, because he would have only three years
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
from discovery rather than the six that the law currently allows him. I hope that I have said enough to the Committee to satisfy it that it would not be right to bring about this change in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to official referees, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Ground) made a very practical point based on his extensive experience of these matters. That will be closely noted, and I am grateful to him for having made it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
