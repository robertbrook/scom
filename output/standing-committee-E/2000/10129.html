	<p>	<i>[Relevant Documents: European Union documents Nos. 9712/00, relating to a statute for Members of the European Parliament, and 9560/00, relating to an audit of expenditure of European Parliament Political groups.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth (Mr. Keith Vaz)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam. I also welcome the opportunity to debate these important matters in Committee and to explain the Government's efforts to reform the financial management of the European Parliament and the way in which European political parties are funded. These are complex matters, but our policy is simple: we want reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak about the European Court of Auditors before turning to its report on the European Parliament's political groups. Successive British Governments have supported the strengthening of the ECA as a way of improving financial management of Community funds. The Maastricht treaty enhanced the ECA's status by making it a full institution of the Community. It also introduced a requirement to produce an annual statement of assurance. We sought and secured in the Amsterdam treaty further strengthening of its powers; we took that further at Nice with reforms to provide better ECA auditing of EC activity, including a new contract committee to promote ECA co-operation with national audit institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are serious about reforming EU institutions and their financial accountability, so I welcome the report of European Court of Auditors into the expenditure of the European Parliament's political groups. That expenditure comprises about 13 per cent. of the European Parliament's total budget. It is clear that the rules governing that expenditure were a mess and I share the Scrutiny Committee's concerns at the laxness of the financial regime described by the ECA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are lessons for all MEPs in the ECA's recommendations. I am glad that the European Parliament accepts that those lessons have to be learned and has agreed a series of reforms. New measures came into force on 1 January and include amalgamation of the administrative and information budgets, as recommended by the report, and the adoption of new rules to clarify correct use of expenditure; drawing up a list of external audit bodies to audit each political group; adoption of common rules for financial regulation of political groups; and supplying the European Parliament with a copy of any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
contract concluded between a group and a third party. Most importantly, the European Parliament agrees with the ECA recommendation for a statute to regulate properly the funding of European political parties. Such a statute would prevent the sort of siphoning off of money to political foundations or parties that the Scrutiny Committee, rightly, strongly criticised in its conclusions. Moreover, it would help to prevent the foreign funding of UK national parties, which we are pledged to end. This is why we strongly support such a statute, why the Nice European summit agreed a legal basis for it and why we sought and secured wording at Nice to stipulate that EC funding for European political parties may not be used to fund national parties either directly or indirectly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is expected to bring forward a proposal soon and we shall have to consider the details. However, the UK strongly supports the principle of a statute in line with the recommendations in the report of the European Court of Auditors. Let me make it clear that we are not criticising Members of the European Parliament, who do an excellent job representing their constituents. However, it is important to consider ways in which to make the provision of funds more transparent, which will assist the whole process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the recommendations by the Group of Eminent Persons on the MEPs statute. MEPs need clear and agreed arrangements for their expenses and remuneration. The absence of transparent rules for expenses undermines the credibility not only of the Parliament, but of the EU as a whole. All too often, the EP's appearances in the UK media are accompanied by "gravy train" headlines. The EP—and the British taxpayer—deserves better. That is why the Government strongly support a statute for MEPs, which would at last provide clear and tough guidelines on MEPs' terms and conditions and introduce proper arrangements to account for the funds that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council and the Parliament have been negotiating the statute for almost two years. I shall not pretend that those negotiations have been easy—they necessitate seeking agreement between 626 parliamentarians from 15 member states, many of whom want different things. We are clear about what we want: thorough reform that sticks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Group of Eminent Persons was appointed by the European Parliament to make recommendations. We do not endorse them all, but they are a useful contribution to the process. We are happy to support many of them, especially those that call for: transparency, accountability and comprehensibility in MEPs' expenses and costs; the ending of current practices on travel expenses; reimbursement based solely on actual expenditure; a clear element of control on MEPs' general allowances; greater transparency on MEPs' contracts with their assistants; and contribution by MEPs to their pension, health and accident insurance schemes. Those recommendations would go a long way towards achieving the reform that we want, and I am glad that the EP has moved towards accepting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
I must register disagreement with the eminent persons on one major aspect of their recommendations—Community taxation for MEPs. To the Government and to UK MEPs it is a point of principle that UK MEPs should continue to pay the same tax as their constituents. We are not alone in holding that view—it is shared by many Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson)—and we have made it clear to the European Parliament that such a provision will be a central element of any overall deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The negotiation of a common salary has been difficult. That is always to be expected when talking about people's salaries. There are huge discrepancies between the salaries of MEPs from different member states. UK MEPs are paid the same as Members of Parliament—a mere £48,000 per year—but a Spanish MEP is paid around £21,000 a year, and the lucky Italians receive around £75,000 a year. The eminent persons recommended a standard MEPs' salary based on the average of the national parliamentary salaries of the four largest member states. However, we believe that an average salary of all 15 member states is the most logical way to achieve a common salary. It would also, as astute members of the Committee will have calculated, produce a standard salary for an MEP that is very close to the pay of MPs here at Westminster— in fact, just below it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that progress will be made on the dossier under the Swedish presidency and that a deal will be struck in the near future. If not, it will not be owing to any lack of effort on our part. Naturally, I shall continue to keep Parliament informed of significant developments. I do not know how matters will be resolved in respect of the MEPs statute or the statute for European political parties, but I can state with certainty that the Government will continue their efforts to secure thorough and lasting reforms. That is in Europe's interests and in Britain's interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Suffolk) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that the effect of funding transnational political parties directly, which is one consequence of the report of the Court of Auditors, would be to disadvantage the United Kingdom Conservative party and the French RPR— Rassemblement pour la Republique—neither of which are members of such parties? </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of our picking on the Conservative party in respect of these provisions. However, appropriate accountability is important, and there is a growing public consensus that it would be wrong to ensure that national parties are funded in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman saw the article on page 16 of 	<i>The Times</i> of 27 January 2000, under the headline, "Perks protest MEPs face legal action." The article was about two members of the United Kingdom Independence party who have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
channelled their expenses and allowances from the European Parliament to fund Euro-sceptic causes. The article stated:
	<br><q><p>"They have openly used this money to support a British shopkeeper who refuses to use the metric system; a butcher who has defied the EU by selling beef on the bone; and commercial fishermen facing EU restrictions."</p></q>
Whatever one thinks of the cases, one will accept that that type of activity is a cause for concern and that it must be dealt with. However, there is no question of the current Government or any other picking on the parties that the hon. Gentleman mentioned by stopping their funding. The proposal has a much broader purpose than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's opening statement and his subsequent comments in response to the Opposition spokesman. Does he agree that there should be a deep distinction between remuneration, taxation and pensions of individual members of the European Parliament, and the funding of their political parties? </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The Government are not trying to prevent MEPs from getting their salaries or pensions. We—meaning Members of the UK Parliament—have a tight system. When we spend, we must produce receipts to be reimbursed, and there is no question of our certifying claims in advance to obtain money from the Fees Office; anyone who has tried it will know that it is impossible. We want to ensure that that system is also used in the European Parliament. The proposal that we are fighting for embodies an important principle and we shall continue to fight for it, but we do not want to interfere with pensions or salaries, which are separate from the other matters that have been mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that this proposal is only the thin end of the wedge? Last year, the Commission stated:
	<br><q><p>"the Union would greatly benefit from having a number of members of the European Parliament elected on European lists, presented to all European voters throughout the Union. The voters would then have to vote twice: once on a national list and once for the group of members on these European lists."</p></q>
It also stated that that would:
	<br><q><p>"encourage the development of Europe-wide political parties and produce members who could claim to represent a European constituency rather than a purely national one."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that proposal, although, given the hon. Gentleman's intonation, I am unsure whether he supports it. It is important that we have a statute that serves our proposed work. We have tried to reform those matters for some time. There is a perception that Members of the European Parliament are involved in a great bandwagon—the gravy train. That is not so. However, to show that things are being done properly, we need a statute that will ensure accountability and transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the citizens of this country want to vote other than for someone they know from the constituency, who will represent them in the European
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Parliament. They want to know that they can seek help from their MEP. Accordingly, we are trying to bring that about within the context that I have explained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his answer to my previous question, with which I am happy. He anticipated my second question, about the British system and whether the Government will advocate that Europe moves toward a system like ours. Will we propose and pursue something similar to our office costs allowance, giving individual MEPs a budget with which to employ staff directly, instead of a scheme in which staff are employed by the Parliament or Commission? </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to examine the detail. The first comment that most hon. Members would make about their office costs allowance is that it is not enough and that it is difficult to manage staff on that sum. As hon. Members will know, that matter is now before the Senior Salaries Review Body, and we hope for a report on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public want to know—perception is always important—that everything is being handled properly, and that people who work for MPs or MEPs have a contract and are dealt with appropriately. There are too many loose ends. The problem with the system in this country is that it takes a long time to be reimbursed: hon. Members have told me about getting into difficulties, such as their telephone being on the verge of being cut off because claims take so long. Such anecdotal points can be dealt with in the detail, but we want to show the public a more transparent approach. I think that our system is pretty good, and I pay tribute to the Fees Office, which does a good job. The issue that needs to be dealt with is one of amounts, not how money is spent—our aim is to ensure sufficient resources to enable MPs and MEPs to carry out their business appropriately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the statement made by the Leader of the House during business questions on 18 January in response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow)? The right hon. Lady said that Conservative Members had misread the rules on the proposed funding of national parties. She said:
	<br><q><p>"Having heard the statement by the Commission spokesman, and having read a clear statement by the Commission, I believe that Conservative Members have misread the rules to which the hon. Gentleman is referring, and that no such provision exists. There is no suggestion that any party will be or could be debarred from receiving funding."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 January 2001; Vol. 361, c. 521.]</p></q>
If it turns out that we have not misread the rules and that we would not benefit from the funding because we are not part of a transnational party, would the Government, on reflection and after considering the matter, undertake to oppose the plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman misunderstood what my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House said. There is no question of discrimination. As I made it clear, we are not discriminating against the Conservative party. No United Kingdom national party will receive funds as a result of the measure. On
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
the contrary, it will be made explicit—as we have long sought—that European Commission funding cannot be used to finance United Kingdom or other national political parties. I should expect the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood to agree with that. Why should EC funds be used to fund national political parties? We have not heard from the hon. Gentleman yet; although I am goading him to speak, he sits looking very calm. I expect that he agrees that that is not a European Union function and that money should not be used in that way. I think that the public would expect the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Eileen Gordon	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Romford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend mentioned Community taxation and I agree that MEPs should pay the same taxes as their constituents. However, the report by the Group of Eminent Persons seemed fairly definite about wanting to proceed along the route of Community taxation. The group argues that it makes no sense to agree a common salary if that is then altered dramatically by different rates of national taxation. How will my hon. Friend resist that course of action? Will doing so hold up the progress of other reforms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that we will hold things up until we get our way. We have pressed that point forcibly in discussions. It is a principle that is accepted on both sides of the House. Members of the European Parliament will want to pay the same tax as their constituents. That is fundamental not only to the principles that we adopt in connection with the European Union, but those of a representative democracy. We are not trying to hold things up; we are trying to improve them, and we have made it clear that we shall not give in. As the Committee knows, we achieved a declaration at Nice on such matters and it is important that people understand our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did the Minister give such a misleading impression to the Committee about two Members of the European Parliament, Messrs. Nigel Farage, and Jeffrey Titford of the United Kingdom Independence party? For example, they were not funding a campaign for imperial measures with their expenses; they were using the excess between the amount that they spend on travel between the United Kingdom and the European Parliament and the fare that MEPs are allowed to claim. Is it not true that other MEPs who pocket the difference are not being held to account, whereas those two MEPs, who tried to use the excess for a worthwhile purpose that is relevant to their parliamentary activities, are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman considers that I have misled the Committee. However, people say that about quotes from the 	<i>The Times,</i> and I was merely quoting that example to illustrate the need for us to ensure that the public are satisfied about what happens to MEPs' expenses. People would be worried if individual causes were funded by such expenses. I am not saying that I approve of any Member of the European Parliament who pockets the difference between what they are entitled to and what they spend. That would not be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The hon. Gentleman's argument is that if MEPs spend such money on a good case, that is okay. I understand that argument, but I cannot accept it. He probably supports such causes, but, given that Northolt is in his constituency, he would be concerned if the money were given Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, for example. Martin Fletcher's article in 	<i>The Times</i> was misleading, but people are concerned about what MEPs do with their money. Such action hits them in the face. We are not at fault in the way in which we administer our allowances, but people would be concerned if there were the slightest sign that they were not being used for the proper purposes. If you were claiming money for travel allowances, you should use it for travelling, not for funding a court case even though that case has merit in the hon. Gentleman's eyes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood did not accuse the Minister of misleading the Committee. Secondly, the Minister used the word "you", and I assure him that I use warrants and do not claim any allowances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. McWilliam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the British position on the state funding of political parties. I hope that the matter under discussion will not be regarded as a step towards that at national level. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell the Committee whether other member states on the continent of Europe might hold different views, which might lead to conflict in the debates on the future funding of European elections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that others have different views; as far as we are concerned, however, ours is the right one. Clearly, some other countries do not support our view, but we must make it clear that we regard it as a matter of principle, as we do the taxation points. We should continue to debate such matters. The European Parliament has a different view, but all the British Labour MEPs are united in a belief that something needs to be done. I cannot, of course, speak for the Conservative group, but that is the view of the Labour group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody comes up to me in the street in Leicester, grabs me and says, "What about the MEPs' statute?" It is not a burning issue. I do not know whether that happens to my hon. Friend the for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) or to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. However, it is an issue that suddenly appears in the headlines. An MEP on the "Today" programme, talking to John Humphreys, will say, "Oh, well I went from Manchester airport, I did X, Y, Z, and I kept the rest" and that is enough to taint everybody. It is important that the public are reassured, which is why we are fighting hard on the statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I ask the hon. Gentleman not to be seen to be the defender of the system. I know that he believes in the cause of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker.

Their causes may be perfect— the right causes to adopt—but it is the principle that matters. Although the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Suffolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you as Chairman of this afternoon's proceedings, Mr. McWilliam and thank the Minister for setting out the details behind the documents for our consideration this afternoon. It certainly made up for what was not quite the same grasp of detail in his answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate covers two distinct proposals, to which I shall refer in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall talk about the MEPs' statute, before turning to some of the more controversial consequences of the Court of Auditors report into the expenditure of the European Parliament's political groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of a statute has something of a history. It has been under discussion in one form or another for the best part of two decades, but remains contentious. European Union Ministers rejected the draft statute from the European Parliament's president and the leaders of the three main groups, instead proposing their own. They are now, seemingly, unable to agree
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
among themselves on some of the more sensitive issues. There is cross-party consensus on many aspects of the proposals contained in the report by the Group of Eminent Persons and the European Parliament recommendations. However, I shall raise one or two matters about which the Opposition have some concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for tightening up the expenses regime in the independent report mirror suggestions supported for some time by Conservative Members of the European Parliament. A fair and visibly transparent system should be put in place and expenses should be directly related to cost. There is no division on that issue, I believe. However, the latest proposals on travel costs, for example, do not go far enough in meeting those aims. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) alluded to some of the problems. From the letter written in December by Pierre Moscovici, the French Minister for Europe, to the European Parliament's president, it seems that Ministers expressed similar concerns through the General Affairs Council. Will the Minister update the Committee on the chances of those concerns being reflected in the final statute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives' greatest concern about the document agreed by the leaders of the three main groups focuses on the issue of salary and taxes. As allied members of the European People's party/European Democrats group, Conservative MEPs are not bound by that document and have made clear their opposition to aspects of it. I assume that, as full members of their groups, Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs are so bound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Moscovici's letter to the European Parliament's president in December made it clear that Ministers regarded the suggested figure of 8,420 euros a month as too high a salary. An average of the parliamentary allowances is the only basis for calculation that would be acceptable to our fellow citizens. The Government apparently agree with that view, but how much success have Ministers had in putting their case to the European Parliament?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A difficulty faced by the European Union institution as a whole has been its dissociation from the peoples of Europe. I make no party political point about that, but the low turnout in European elections and the widespread sense of alienation and disaffection about the institutions of the European Union are matters of great concern to all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that we must ensure that that dissociation must not happen in the case of MEPs? Proportional representation and a common European Union salary would not help the situation. I am sure that the Minister would agree that considerable practical difficulties stand in the way of MEPs associating with the areas that they represent, because there is no direct link. That presents a problem and is a reason why disaffection about the whole process of the European Union exists in many member countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister recognise the danger that such a salary presents? Even if the salary were set at a reasonable level, it might increase disproportionately
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
in years to come because of exchange rate fluctuations, or a link with top-level official salaries. We would have no control over those matters. The Minister observed that there was a direct link between the salaries of British MEPs and of Members of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are especially concerned about the proposal in both the Group of Eminent Persons report and the European Parliament president's report that MEPs should be subject to a special European Community rate of income tax. I believe that the Minister will agree with our view on that matter, which is straightforward. Conservatives believe that MEPs should pay the same rates of tax as the constituents that they represent. They should pay national rates of taxation, not a Community rate. I hope that the Government will agree with us, that the Minister will, in due course, restate their position and that we shall receive clarification on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Auditors report into the funding of political groups in the European Parliament is extremely valuable. It is comprehensive and detailed and examines many spheres in which the rules need to be strengthened and enforcement improved. It is already leading to welcome tighter controls across the board in the spending of public money by political groups in the European Parliament. The European Parliament circulated a comprehensive set of new rules in December, which are to be welcomed. However, the report has also led to a development that is far from welcome to Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A proposal for a Council regulation on funding for pan-European parties was agreed by the Commission at its meeting last week. It follows directly from the auditors' anxiety about current procedures for channelling money from political groups in the European Parliament to pan-European parties such as the European People's party, the Party of European Socialists and the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform party, and the auditors' desire for greater transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such anxiety is justified. It is right and proper for such funding from groups to transnational parties to be stopped. The Court of Auditors said that such transfer had no legal basis, but any shortfall in funding that transnational parties suffered as a result should be made up by their component national parties. Instead, the Commission wants to fund pan-European parties directly using taxpayers' money. That is totally unacceptable. First, it is wrong in principle for the EU to regulate political parties. Secondly, it is wrong for pan-European political parties, as opposed to parliamentary groups, to be funded by the taxpayer. Thirdly, the measure is in effect and practice discriminatory. I understand that both UK Commissioners share our anxiety. I should like clarification of the Government's stance on that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In agreeing the proposal last week, the Commission said that:
	<br><q><p>"holding political views favourable to European integration is not a precondition to obtaining the status of a European political party, nor for receiving Community financing".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
I am sure that we should all be grateful for small mercies. However, does the Minister recognise that giving the money to pan-European political parties means that, in Britain at least, the effect is exactly the same?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point is crucial. Unlike Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative party is not a pan-European political party. Evidence given to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs before the Nice Council suggests that the Foreign Secretary may have made the fatal mistake of believing his own rhetoric on the issue. He seemed genuinely to believe that we were members of the EPP. We are not. Conservative MEPs are allied to the EPP/ED group in the European Parliament, but that is not a political party. Nor is the European Democrat Union, which is an association of centre-right parties across the European continent that has no intention of incorporating as a European political party. We have no relationship with the transnational EPP, which is such a party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that national parties will not be funded directly, but the pan-European parties, of which the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties are full members, would be funded directly from the taxpayer. Surely that will boost their ability to promote their case. It may also mean that the national parties benefit from having to pay lower subscriptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall effect in Britain will be to disadvantage the one mainstream political party that does not favour further political integration in the EU. We are discussing public funds paid by British taxpayers of all political persuasions and none. Does the Minister not regard such discrimination as entirely unacceptable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such discrimination is not a coincidental effect. It is obviously more likely that a party that favours much further European integration will want to sign itself up as part of a pan-European party. Indeed, Labour politicians have welcomed the fact that the Conservative party will be disadvantaged as a result of our political views. One Labour source was reported in 	<i>The Times</i> of 17 January as saying that it would serve the Leader of the Opposition right because it would mean that he was
	<br><q><p>"hoist by his own Eurosceptic petard".</p></q>
On 25 January, Simon Murphy, leader of Labour's MEPs, said that we were victims of our own extremism. By that, he meant our insistence on standing up for the views of the majority of his fellow countrymen on European political integration, for which I make no apology. Indeed, he is Labour leader only because the crushing defeat that the Labour party suffered in the European elections led to the voluntary retirement of two of its more prominent members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party is not alone. In France, the Gaullist RPR is not a member of a transnational party. The main centre-right parties in two of the four larger member states of the EU would therefore lose out, and I am sure that the Minister would not regard that as fair. The effect of such a discriminatory measure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
wholly justifies the term "funds for federalism". It works systematically to the advantage of federalist parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reported that both UK Commissioners opposed the plans. In 	<i>The</i> Times of 25 January, Neil Kinnock reportedly objected for
	<br><q><p>"reasons of democracy and political common sense".</p></q>
Does the Minister share Commissioner Kinnock's common sense and belief in democracy? If so, will he assure the Committee that any such proposal will be vetoed by the Government in the Council of Ministers, or was the report in 	<i>The Times</i> of 17 January right to state that the Foreign Office had indicated that it was broadly supportive of the measure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister realise that signing away our national veto in that area, as the Prime Minister did at Nice, was the height of folly? It means that further regulation of parties and new conditions on funding could be introduced later without the Government being able to block them. That would be fundamentally undemocratic. The British people should be able, through Parliament and the House of Commons, to decide whether our political parties should operate under a legal framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is all too typical of the EU's reaction to problems. The Commission rightly seeks to tackle abuse of existing EU procedures, but it is doing so by introducing new EU competences. The European Union should tackle abuse by doing less, not more. That is the ultimate lesson to have been learned from recent crises in fraud and maladministration in the EU. It is a lesson that EU institutions and the Government need to start learning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say that I have absolute confidence in my hon. Friend the Minister as Britain's representative, especially in the discussions on MEPs' allowances, costs, expenses, remuneration and taxation. My hon. Friend is fair minded and I am sure that we shall arrive at a sensible and fair solution to the knotty problems that doubtless exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that MEPs should be as independent in their everyday operations as Members of Parliament. That is why I emphasise the importance of the office costs allowance scheme, under which MEPs' staff will not be provided by the Commission or the European Parliament, but can be employed directly. It is important for democracy that MEPs should have access to their own staff and that they should be able to choose their own employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding of political parties in the European Parliament is an entirely separate issue. I shall suggest a way forward later that might overcome some of those problems. A question mark hangs over the proposals on the democratic operation of political parties in the European Parliament. It is important that parties should retain their independence. They should be able to speak with the voice of their members and of those who vote for them—their constituents. They have a distinctive contribution to make. Political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
parties should not be pressed into accepting views that may not be exactly what their constituents and members would wish them to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall use the Liberal Democrat party as an example because there are no Liberal Democrat Members here today. Let us suppose that the Liberal Democrat party fell out badly with its compatriots in Europe, held different views from the other members of its group and wanted to withdraw from it. If the money were paid to the group, the party would suffer. That would create pressure for it to stay in the group and might make it go along with views that it did not share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned that the money could be seen as the thick end of the wedge—as a move towards state funding of political parties. We should avoid that. The funding should be seen as more in the nature of Short money, which is different. Opposition parties, which do not have access to the civil service and the support that Governments receive, clearly need some research money and support to operate effectively. Lord Short proposed that type of funding in the first instance and we strongly support it. The money for political parties and groupings in the European Parliament should be seen in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, it is seen as campaigning money, that is a different matter. Inevitably, if parties do not have to pay for so much of their research, they will have more money left for campaigning. That is a problem. One cannot subtract money and it can be put to all types of uses. The money should be seen as supporting the effective operation of a political party in the Parliament in terms of research and the gathering of information, not as part of its propaganda and campaigning effort, or its election machine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take a strong line on the funding of political parties, not just by the state, but by private donations. Any source of funding that comes from outside a party should concern us. Parties should be financed by their members and by the people affiliated to them directly, in a democratic way, as my party mostly is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been problems with party funding in recent years. I applaud the Government's attempt to make the matter more open and transparent. There should be much tighter limits on the amounts given by individuals. I was one of the very small number of Labour Members—there were five of us to be precise—who suggested in an early-day motion that the limit on individual donations should be reduced from the original £100,000 to £5,000. That is a considerable reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is drifting rather wide of the matter under discussion. I invite him to return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. I was trying to make a point about external sources of funding and the independence of parties, which applies to this debate. Our parties should be independent of any influence other than that of their members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to establish whether the hon. Gentleman has a point of principle in mind. I accept his point about transparency. We share his view. However, does he think that funding—he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
interpreted it as a variant on Short funding—from European taxpayers should be made available only to parties that are transnational in character? Does he think that that is fair and reasonable in principle? </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I was coming to that point. The Government should consider the idea that money should be given to national political parties, enabling them to choose to contribute that money to the grouping to which they belong in the European Parliament. For example, the money would go to the Greek Liberal Democrat party, which might be an independent party belonging to the larger Liberal grouping in Europe. That party could choose to pool that funding with others, but it would not be compelled to give it up if it left that grouping. It could take the funding with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would clearly run counter to what has been proposed, but it would overcome the problem. The concerns of our Commissioner, Neil Kinnock, are legitimate and I share them. However, such a measure would not prevent parties from grouping together—in socialist groups, for example—and pooling their funding for legitimate mutual purposes. It would overcome the problem of independent parties that are not part of a wider grouping not receiving any wider funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult to pursue such views in European discussions, but the concerns are felt not only among Opposition Members. I hope that such solutions can at least be considered as a possible way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a privilege to follow my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring), whose penetrating speech will, I hope, be widely reported, and the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), who always tries to find the heart of European issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest, in a sense. I am the leader of the Federated Group of Christian Democrats and European Democrats in the Assembly of the Western European Union, and Chief Whip of the European Democratic Group of the Council of Europe. At least at one remove, I have an idea of how the European system of political groups operates, even though I have never been a Member of the European Parliament, as many distinguished Members of the House have, and have never fully comprehended how that Parliament works. I am sure that many of our constituents share my general impression of it—that it is a cosy billet, in Air Force parlance, and that its Members are not short of a bob or two in terms of expenses. I may be oversimplifying, but the Court of Auditors' report emphasised several deficiencies that need to be rectified, and I am glad that Her Majesty's Government are keen so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We focused on travel expenses, so I shall relate my experiences as someone who has served on the WEU and the Council of Europe for several years, in the hope that the system that the United Kingdom delegation operates may be used as a model for travel expenses for MEPs. The normal expense for travel
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
between the United Kingdom and the place of work, be it Strasbourg, Brussels, Paris or wherever, is the business class return air fare. If people choose to make their own way to the place of work, they must produce receipts to show that the travel was undertaken, and he or she is reimbursed according to the sum spent, not according to the notional fare. That straightforward system should operate for the European Parliament. If that Parliament does not operate it, it obviously wants to continue to hide something from the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear distinction between the funding of political groups in the European Parliament and the funding of political parties on a European level per se. Nevertheless, I instinctively disapprove of the institutional public funding of political parties, be they national or transnational. I am sure that our electors would feel that it would be much healthier for democracy if there were no state funding, EU funding, or disproportionate funding from big business. I hope that we will move in that direction. We are discussing European Union funding, and I feel that funding political groups in the European Parliament according to their strength in that Parliament merely reinforces success. It makes it difficult for new political parties trying to make their mark on the European scene to compete. I raise the fundamental criticism that that is anti-democratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding of European political parties as such— not only the political groups—will again be allocated according to respective strengths in the European Parliament, so the same criticisms will apply unless the formula is altered. However, whatever the Minister may say, it is liable to cross-subsidy. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk said so clearly in his admirable speech, expenditure that would otherwise be met out of national funds can in many instances be met out of transnational funding from EU sources. That is unjust and wrong. The Minister said that EU funding for European political parties cannot be used to finance national activities, but such activities will now have to be funded from the EU when they relate to European policies that have an impact on national politics and there will therefore be some cross-subsidy. I am unhappy with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On salaries, I am sure that Her Majesty's Government are correct; the Opposition support them fully on that issue. There should be no question of people who are already regarded as ultra-privileged and, as such, living a life far removed from the mass of our national electors, enjoying tax privileges and salaries that are much higher than those of their national Member of Parliament counterparts. The remedy seems simple: if the European Union awards MEPs a higher salary level and preferential tax treatment, the Government should not make up the difference. In other words, we should limit our contribution to that element of EU expenditure to what MEPs would be paid, and taxed, at the national level. That measure would attract great support and understanding in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk eloquently made clear, we do not support the proposal. National parties such as the RPR and the Conservative party have made a great impact on European affairs. No one can say that, when the RPR formed the majority Government in France under de Gaulle, it was not instrumental in driving the European Community forward. The Conservative party has played its part. The fact that we are not a confessional party and differ from our Christian Democratic friends in several areas—and therefore do not wish to join the EPP—should not exclude us from fair treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fair treatment is all that we are asking for. I hope that members of the Committee will vote against the proposals, even though doing so may seem a futile exercise—even if we secured a majority, the instrument would still automatically go through on a nod on the Floor of the House, without a vote even being taken. However, we will have made a stand for democracy, national rights and accountability. I am sure that electors will be pleased about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) and for Stone (Mr. Cash) to join the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, but they did not. We nevertheless had a thoughtful, intelligent debate about an issue of great importance to MEPs and the public. It is not a burning issue that people in Luton town centre, Bury St. Edmunds or, indeed, the centre of Leicester rush up to talk about, but it is one that can easily get out of control because the way in which things are done is perceived in a certain way. That is why it is important that we conclude a statute—we hope as soon as possible—that will stay with us for many years to come.

The Government are pro-Europe and pro-reform. The adoption of a statute has been one of the matters that has most concerned us. It is important that we look for ways to ensure complete transparency from those who receive European funds. The Government are at the forefront of initiatives to improve financial management and to fight fraud. The European Parliament has taken steps to ensure that changes are made, but we believe that it must do more. It must get its house in order. We want the statute to be agreed as quickly as possible, but we do not want it at any price. We must have thorough expenses reform and we believe that United Kingdom MEPs should pay UK

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This point simply has to be made. European MEPs get the identical salary to MPs.

Members would accept that other issues must be discussed elsewhere. I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but I do not think that we need to make too

much of the linkage. I believe that our suggestion is the right one, but I have noted the points made by both hon. Members.

On the funding of political parties, I must re-emphasise to the hon. Member for West Suffolk that there is no question of funding for the Labour party or the Liberal Democrats and not the Conservative party. We want no domestic political party to have funds channelled to it for national political purposes. The Conservative party is allied to the EPP parliamentary group, which is funded from public money allocated by the European Parliament. The Conservative party is also a member of the European Democratic Union, which shares offices, staff and equipment with the EPP at their joint headquarters in Brussels. The hon. Gentleman has probably visited them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent European Democratic Union leaders' meeting, which was attended by William Hague, the leader of the Conservative party, was held in Berlin at the same time as the EPP congress on 11 January 2001. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)—you were about to correct me, Mr. McWilliam—has been invited to, and has attended, meetings of EPP leaders before European summits, although we missed him at Nice because he was otherwise engaged. The point is that no party should receive national funding, not that one should do so or not do so because it does or does not belong to a particular group. No party should receive such funding as a result of what the European Commission or Parliament does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the taxation point, it is important to remember the declaration that we secured at Nice, but it is also important to continue to work on the reform agenda. The kind words of the hon. Member for West Suffolk about the former leader of the Labour party, Mr. Neil Kinnock, will be welcomed in Brussels when I show him the 	<i>Hansard</i> report. It is good to know that Conservative Members support wholeheartedly the excellent work that is being done by Neil Kinnock. The souffleé is about to rise and Conservative Members—I remember what they used to say about Mr. Kinnock—now accept that he is going a good job in the European Commission. He wants what the Labour Government want: reform of the European Union. What will most impress the British people is to achieve the consensus that we have achieved today. The institution is worth while, but it needs to be reformed and we shall continue our efforts to drive that reform agenda forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
