	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the European Commission's communication on asylum. It is an important document in the development of a common European asylum system and it starts a debate in which the Government intend to be actively involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission communication on a common asylum procedure and uniform status was presented in parallel with the communication on a Community immigration policy that the Committee debated last week. It was adopted by the Commission on 22 November 2000 and presented to member states for the first time at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 30 November. An explanatory memorandum was submitted for parliamentary scrutiny on 15 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extraordinary council at Tampere in October 1999 reaffirmed our commitment to setting the minimum standards required by the treaty of Amsterdam and, in the longer term, to establishing a common European asylum system. The communication is a direct result of that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government fully support such action at European Community level. Moves towards harmonisation of the asylum process should ensure more equitable treatment for those seeking asylum and so reduce the secondary movement of asylum seekers between member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the treaty of Amsterdam, member states set themselves the challenge of establishing minimum standards for the asylum process by May 2004. By virtue of our protocol to that treaty, the United Kingdom can choose on a case-by-case basis whether to opt in to each element. In May 1999, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced our policy of opting into those elements that did not interfere with the maintenance of our border controls. The UK is playing an active part in negotiations on asylum and good progress is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have adopted, for example, the regulation on Eurodac, the EU-wide system for comparing and exchanging asylum seekers' fingerprints. We have also established the European refugee fund to assist member states with the reception and integration of refugees and asylum seekers, or the return of those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
whose applications are unfounded. The UK has opted into those measures and discussions are well advanced on minimum standards for the temporary protection of displaced persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negotiations have also begun on minimum standards for asylum procedures. The draft directive on asylum procedures was recently the subject of an inquiry by the House of Lords European Union Committee, which recently published a report on the directive, to which the Government will publish a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also expected that, within the next few months, the Commission will present draft proposals on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers, minimum standards for qualification as a refugee and a new instrument on responsibility for considering asylum applications to replace the Dublin convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary's speech to the Foreign Press Association last week emphasised the importance that the Government attach to the setting of minimum standards for the elements of the asylum process. He also proposed that minimum standards on asylum procedures should be complemented by the mutual recognition of member states' asylum systems, including their interpretations of international instruments. Such mutual recognition would assist co-operation between member states, particularly decisions about responsibility for asylum applications made under the terms of the Dublin convention and its forthcoming first pillar successor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main elements of the first stage of the harmonisation process, paving the way for the second stage, which will be the establishment of a common asylum system. The Home Secretary's proposal for mutual recognition is designed to help bridge the gap between those two stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's communication looks beyond the current work on the establishment of minimum standards for the asylum process. Its intent is to begin a debate on the second stage, moving on from minimum standards towards a common system. It raises questions about the extent to which member states want to move towards a common procedure and the shape that that procedure might take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is wide-ranging, and it is divided into five main sections. The first part sets out the current asylum situation in the EU and the relevant international law. It also covers the objectives and scope of a common asylum system. The Commission argues that the common procedure and uniform status must be applied not only to cases covered by the Geneva convention, but to all international protection needs. The Government fully support such an approach. The alternative—a common procedure covering only Geneva convention cases and leaving other cases to member states' discretion—would be relatively limited in its impact, not least because strong incentives for secondary migration would remain as economic migrants and people smugglers shopped around for the best deal in subsidiary forms of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
The first part of the communication also emphasises that the Commission is not proposing that a community body should take asylum decisions, on the grounds that that would be against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Again, the Commission has the Government's full support on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the document points out that the draft directive on minimum standards for asylum procedures, which is under discussion, is only the first step towards a common system. It does not require member states to apply uniform procedures. A move towards common procedural standards would require a restriction in the flexibility allowed to member states. That might include, for example, common definitions of safe countries of origin, as proposed by the Home Secretary in his speech to a European conference on asylum in Lisbon last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the communication discusses the comprehensive procedure already operated in some member states, including the United Kingdom, whereby an application rejected under the Geneva convention criteria is automatically considered for other forms of international protection by the same body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next part of the communication discusses the options for the rights and status granted to those in need of international protection and, in particular, whether the beneficiaries of subsidiary forms of protection should have the same rights as those granted refugee status under the Geneva convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth part of the communication points out that the move towards a common procedure will require a significant increase in information sharing and a common approach to information and statistics on asylum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the communication considers mechanisms by which the EU might move from short-term minimum standards to longer-term harmonisation. It is argued that the current process of setting minimum standards, which has a deadline of May 2004, must be informed by the long-term goal of a common European asylum system. For that reason, the minimum standards now being considered must be reasonably ambitious, and the Government agree with that analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government welcome the clear references in the communication to the proposals put forward by the Home Secretary in his speech in Lisbon in June. The proposals include an EU resettlement programme, the possibility of asylum applications being lodged from outside the EU and a common categorisation of countries of origin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an interesting and thoughtful document, and I welcome the Committee's decision to debate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am for questions. I strongly request that they be brief and asked one at a time, so that we can use our time effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lidington 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Aylesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister believe that a harmonised, common European system and status for asylum is a desirable objective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it could well be. In terms of the opt-out that we secured, any proposals emerging from the document would have to be compatible with our border control. Certainly, in respect of asylum seekers and various claims made within the European Union, it is clear that this is a Europe-wide issue. The ambitious aim of a common policy could prove desirable, but ultimately it must be compatible with the desire of the UK and with the opt-out. Border control must remain in the hands of the UK Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to probe the Minister a little on that answer. Her desire for a common policy seems incompatible with the UK's opting out of those elements that the Government do not like, or which do not fit into their strategy. Every member state could decide that, even though it wants a common policy in theory, in practice it must opt out of the bits it does not like. However, would such an approach lead to a common policy that can achieve our aims?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first stage of the process and the measures implemented so far signalled our intention to opt in, and thus far there has been no difficulty. Indeed, in the light of this document we anticipate no difficulties, but it would be unwise to bind ourselves at this stage, and the Committee would not expect us to do so. Given emerging European Union discussions, perhaps a policy will come to light that we can opt into. However, as I made clear in the session last week on immigration, because of its unique geography and history the UK has developed differently from continental Europe. For that reason, we must measure the question of opting in against the desire to retain control of our borders. Certainly, we have felt able to opt into measures such as Eurodac and the refugee fund, and at this stage I think it likely that we will feel similarly about other measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once the United Kingdom decides to opt into a particular asylum measure, it becomes justiciable in the European Court of Justice and we cannot opt out simply because we dislike a particular ECJ interpretation of it. Does the Minister agree that opting in is an irrevocable decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is right that we should consider the various measures. We are dealing with a UN convention to which, unlike immigration policy, all EU member states are already signatories. All are signatories to the UN convention on torture, which can also give rise to some subsidiary forms of protection. Moreover, all subscribe to the principles of the European convention on human rights. It therefore seems reasonable to contend that we should move towards a common policy in this area, albeit with the caveat that I outlined. I do not deny that these are serious and important decisions that the UK will have to make at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One feature of refugee policy that goes back before the war, which was raised by Amnesty International and others in connection with the document, is the contradiction between trying to prevent illegal entry by those seeking asylum while offering very limited possibilities of seeking asylum from outside the borders of the European Union. How does the Minister envisage that problem being tackled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some important issues are being generated not only by this document, but by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as it approaches the commemoration of its 50th anniversary next month. The policy involves inherent contradictions in that it is difficult and, indeed, unusual for refugees to make applications in their regions of origin. They usually make their claims in different parts of the world. Moreover, there is a disparity between the level of support that we provide to help the poorer countries of the world to support large numbers of refugees and the amount of money that is spent on processing applications in the developed world, many of which will be unfounded in convention terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other main issue is that of the convention being used as a migratory instrument for illegal immigration, which was never envisaged by the framers of the convention—indeed, they would have been dismayed to see it used in that way. The UNHCR would emphatically say that it is not a migratory instrument. Several complex issues are involved, which the Home Secretary tried to address in his Lisbon speech and his recent speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I heard the Minister correctly, she said that it was unusual for applications for asylum to be made in the region of origin. It is my understanding that the statistics do not bear that out, so I would be grateful if she could tell me where she got her information. For example, the figures for Afghanistan refugees are 1.6 million in Iran and 1 million in Pakistan. In comparison, the numbers that have come to the European Union pale into insignificance. Will the Minister clarify her remarks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Lady slightly confused what I said. I said that most of the world's refugees are from the poorer countries. However, my point concerned the way in which the convention operates and the possibility that Europe's acceptance of refugees means that people have to come to Europe to make their claims and to get resettlement in Europe as refugees. The Home Secretary has floated the idea— which, interestingly, has been picked up by the Commission—that it may be possible for asylum seekers or those seeking refuge to make an application in the region of origin. We could then consider the possibility either of increased protection in the region of origin—I have already referred to the disparity in terms of money—or of resettlement in European Union countries, as with the evacuation programme from Kosovo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Gerrard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Walthamstow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to have systems that allow people to apply in the regions where they are based, have resettlement programmes and begin to lure them in that direction, does the Minister agree that it should be made clear that that would be complementary to—and not an alternative for—those who arrive spontaneously and apply for asylum? We do not want to create the public perception that those who have come through the resettlement programme are genuine, whereas those who apply spontaneously must be fraudulent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the obligation under the convention is that one examines matters on a case-by-case basis, and that is right. However, the proposal that has been outlined by the Home Secretary is interesting, and has been taken up. If one talks to the UNHCR about the matter, it plays well into its concerns about the disparity in resources between the processing of cases in the developed world and the amount spent on support. The ideas in the proposal mirror some ideas in the programmes of other countries. Asylum claims must always be examined on a case-by-case basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to the evidence she gave to the European Scrutiny Committee, in which she expressed:
	<br><q><p>"concerns about the different ways in which the concept of a 'uniform status … valid throughout the Union' may be interpreted."</p></q>
Will she enlarge upon where she thinks problems might arise over different interpretations? Is it potential freedom of movement between countries that causes the Government concern and is their concern over interpretation shared widely in the EU, or have institutions in other member states taken a different position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are at an early stage—the document is only a communication. I imagine that our concerns are shared by a number of other member states. We must examine this as a matter of interpretation. If one is looking for a common policy, one can make an argument for uniform status. Free movement, however, is a completely separate issue. We have free movement for EU nationals and our view would be that freedom of movement in the EU can only be given after the acquisition of nationality in member states. That will emerge as an item of discussion and I imagine that other member states have similar concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her thoughtful replies. The broad thrust of the document is procedural and organisational. I wonder whether she sees scope for consultation on the interpretation of the laws. For example, consultation could take place on whether an application could be rejected on the grounds that an act of torture was by a wayward official and not an act of state policy. In the past, I understand that different practices have been followed in different European Union countries. Does the Minister see a role for the EU in trying to iron out such differences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting question. We will be dealing with that matter even sooner than is provided for in the document, because it is part of stage 1—the definition of a refugee. It is true that some EU countries do not recognise non-state persecution as a qualification for refugee status. However, such countries grant a lower form of subsidiary protection in such cases, which is the equivalent of our exceptional leave to remain. We are in a fairly fluid situation, because case law in some of those other states seems to be developing in a way that does not recognise the distinction. EU member states will have to address the issue soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the idea, floated by the Home Secretary, of applicants being able to apply from their region of origin. As she said, that is not the current system. I would be grateful if she answered a question that I first asked at the end of a debate in the Chamber when she did not have time to answer. Under the current system, how can an Afghanistan woman, who speaks English and therefore wishes to come to the UK to seek asylum, legally seek asylum in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If people are fleeing persecution, they should apply for asylum in the first safe third country in which they arrive. That springs so clearly from every consideration, and certainly any other EU member state would agree. The first consideration must be that people in danger should flee to the first safe third state. That is important, and I know of no country that would take a different line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the British Government like to see EU legislation on refugee status that limited it to persecution by a Government or Government agencies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Along with the UNHCR interpretation and most member states, we have always recognised non-state persecution too. In reality, the difference in Europe has not been apparent because other countries have gone for a form of temporary protection such as ours. As I said, case law is moving towards the British position and that of most other member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of subsidiary status is raised in the documents from the Commission about whether there should be more subsidiary statuses and what they might be. Will that mean that exceptional leave to remain will become formalised? Does the Minister see that developing as a single subsidiary status and how will it relate to rights of appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question, but it is probably too early to say. There are two issues—one relates to status, and the other concerns what accrues from that status. We have had a difference in full refugee status. My preliminary view is that it is important that we recognise the unique nature of a convention refugee, which is why we have accorded it such status. Other forms of protection are meant to be temporary because, although they apply in cases in which something has happened that makes it difficult for refugees to return home, it does not mean that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
those refugees qualify for convention status. That is a preliminary view, but I have no doubt that it will be a key issue of discussion among member states as we move ahead with the second stage process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that someone fleeing persecution should seek refuge in the first safe country that they reach. Will she describe the circumstances in which the UK would be the first safe country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes people fly directly to an airport in the UK. The hon. Lady must recognise that the convention never contemplated asylum shopping, whereby people look around to decide where they want to go. That has to be sharply distinguished from the basic and fundamental human right to claim asylum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister further on exceptional leave to remain? If subsidiary forms of protection are to be formalised within a Community legal instrument, it is inevitable that exceptional leave to remain will cease to become a discretionary measure to be applied by the Secretary of State and will instead become a transparent measure whereby decisions are taken in accordance with published criteria. Surely, there will have to be either a right to appeal or judicial review, because third parties will make judgments as to whether those criteria have been properly enforced. The measure proposes a big change in what we now term "exceptional leave to remain".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily—the devil will be in the detail. The criteria for granting exceptional leave to remain are quite transparent at present; we provide information about how we arrive at our decisions. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this is a big subject, but I do not think that it will necessarily have the consequences that he has outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Traditionally, refugee status has been associated with physical flight from the country in which persecution takes place. With modern telecommunications, it will become increasingly feasible for people to seek asylum from the country that they want to leave—for example, someone in Afghanistan who feels threatened but has not yet left his country—without being detected by censors or putting themselves in danger. Does the Minister believe that this would be a legitimate way, in principle, for someone to seek asylum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point, but it is difficult to envisage the circumstances in which that would be the position. The convention stipulates that people must be outside the country that they are leaving before they can make a valid asylum claim. Undoubtedly, some people will want to consider that issue in the global consultation that the UNHCR has initiated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister disparagingly used the term "asylum shopping". Is she implying that the only consideration for someone seeking asylum should be safety and that they should not have the right to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
a choice on the basis of knowledge of a host country, language or historical or cultural links with a particular country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My comments were not meant to be disparaging. Asylum shopping does occur, and the hon. Lady must know that from her experience. The answer to her question is, yes, the strongest consideration must be protection. Why is the convention so important? The reason why it is important, why we should commemorate the 50th anniversary, and why it has a special status in the UK is that it provides the unique right to protect oneself from persecution. That right was developed after the second world war and secondary conditions should not be part of it. It has to be ring-fenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the question of subsidiary status? Does it generally imply that someone will be in the country for a temporary period? That has been true for specific programmes such as the humanitarian evacuation programme from Macedonia. Clearly in this paper the Commission envisages situations in which people need international protection. It refers to article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which will perhaps become more important for our case law. Is it really sustainable to have a long-term situation where people are given what we should perhaps describe as additional, rather than subsidiary forms of protection, with lower standards and lesser rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it is right, for the reasons I have given before, to distinguish between the unique nature of refugee status and others. By their very nature, some of the subsidiary protections may well be temporary. There may be a sudden movement as a result of drastic events such as an outbreak of war or civil unrest. At the end of the day, most people want to return to their homes and their communities. It is therefore right to draw such a distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I turn to the Commission's proposals for minimum standards of reception that it adopted on 3 April? What implication does that proposal have for the present system in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that we are not discussing that document today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, I shall not stray too far. In general, the proposal will not necessitate too many changes for us. As hon. Members will know, the Committee in another place recently reported on it and, broadly speaking, concluded that our procedures are in line with the standards that are being proposed. We will, of course, respond fully to that Committee as soon as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fairly clear that we will be the first safe country less often than Italy, Austria and a number of other countries. Does the Minister welcome the stress that the paper puts on resettlement assistance? Does she agree that the UK has a particular
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
role to play in helping those of our partners who have to do more to help refugees for whom they are the first safe haven?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Resettlement and integration are important subjects that sometimes get neglected. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question. We are launching a national integration strategy for those given refugee status and others who have leave to remain. We are trying to look at best practice in this area. Much good practice has taken place in various parts of the UK and we are anxious to bring that together. Certainly, we will also look at what is done in other countries. We hope to communicate our experience to other EU member states too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people think that one of the pull factors that encourages asylum seekers to come to the United Kingdom is what is perceived as a generous benefits or voucher system—the financial support given to asylum seekers. Does the Minister think it desirable or likely that among the common procedures used by European Union states would be a common system of financial support for asylum seekers while their application is being processed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are shortly to consider a draft directive on minimum standards of reception, which will consider some of the different methods operated throughout the European Union and what the minimum standards should be. I am sure that that will excite much discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The background paper helpfully circulated to the Committee by the Home Office noted that research has shown that, in fact, claims for benefit were no greater among immigrant and asylum communities than among the indigenous population. Does the Minister agree that there is no research evidence to show that the size of benefit is really a significant factor in people's decision whether to apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The research paper to which my hon. Friend refers is the document on migration that we published in January. I was grateful for the helpful comments made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and other Committee members about that document. Of course, it was about migration, not asylum, but I am happy to confirm that one interesting thing was that it showed the net positive financial contribution that migrants make to this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister further on the draft directive on reception, which is mentioned on page 10 at paragraph 2.4 of the document. The full text of the Commission's draft proposal is not yet available in the Library. I hope that the Government will make a copy available. Is the Commission proposing entitlements to legal advice and the facility of an interpreter, when appropriate? If that is in the directive, will that not require certain changes in our domestic arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to forgive me, but we are not yet at that stage. To make the position clear to the Committee, the reception directive that the hon. Gentleman mentioned is not the same as the procedure directive, which was the subject of a report in another place. The reception proposal was published by the Commission on 3 April and has not yet even been presented to the Council. We have not seen its details yet, so it is too soon to comment, but the hon. Gentleman has my assurance that as soon as we are able, we will make our views known to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission appears to envisage a two-stage process in which we start with relatively limited common procedures and then move to an integrated procedure. The second stage would imply restricting options in spheres in which the first stage allows a degree of flexibility. Should we not ensure that when we have higher national standards it is possible to retain them, even with the move to common procedures at the second stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is too early to say; we are at such an early stage. It is safe to say that, as all the draft directives are now being published, a great deal more progress has recently been made. My starting point is that all member states are signatories to the convention, to the principles of the European convention on human rights and to other conventions such as that on torture. All European Union member states are democracies, with highly developed parliamentary and legal systems. A common system must be negotiated; nothing can stay the same and there must be discussion. It is too early to say what those discussions will be about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the unique geography of the United Kingdom within the European Union, what difficulties does the Minister foresee if we do not participate in the measures for common procedures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, we have shown our willingness to take part in all the procedures. It could be argued that if there were a common policy in which we did not participate, it might make us more attractive to unfounded claims for asylum, which we would have to take into consideration at the appropriate time. The key is to complete the first stage and to start discussions on the important second stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In paragraph 2.5 of the document, the Commission states that in the spring of this year it will propose a first-stage Community instrument to replace the Dublin convention. Can the Minister say when that will be published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are glad about that and we are anxious to start that important work as soon as possible. It is clear that the Dublin convention has not worked in the way envisaged by the previous Government. Before the Dublin convention, people who arrived from France, for example, could be sent straight back there for their asylum applications to be considered. Since the previous Government signed the Dublin convention, that is no longer the case because
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
it must be shown where people claiming asylum first entered the European Union. We are looking forward to taking part in the work and are actively encouraging the Commission to introduce the proposal as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government have any idea of the nature of the instrument that should replace the Dublin convention? As the Minister knows, the Commission's document revisiting the Dublin convention listed several different principles on which a replacement measure could be based. Have the Government a view on what is preferable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want the Commission to deal with a situation that was not envisaged when the previous Government signed the convention: the numbers of people who are illegally resident in another member state and do not make an application for asylum there, but come to the United Kingdom or to a different country and then make a claim. It is vital that a successor regime should consider that matter, and we shall look at the proposal with great interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister see the Eurodac system, to which she alluded earlier, as being relevant to the problem that she described? Can she say when it will come fully into operation? Will fingerprinting apply only to people who formally claim asylum or will the French Government, for example, fingerprint those people living in the Sangatte camp?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps as the proceedings continue I will be able to give the hon. Gentleman a precise answer about timing. At present, Eurodac applies to those who apply for asylum, not to those who are illegally resident. Of course, the difficulty is that all member states have their own jurisdictions for how they deal with people in that process. During our proceedings, I hope that I will be able to give a more precise date for when Eurodac will come into being, but agreement has already been reached on it. It now remains to ensure that the systems come into place, but the UK is ahead of the game.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Stevenson, and to the Minister for my late arrival, especially if my question has already been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we move towards a common system, standards and application process, might circumstances arise in which asylum seekers are encouraged to move to European Union countries where there are fewer applicants per head of population?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will not arise in this process. However, from the issues raised in the global consultations that the UNHCR has initiated, and the Home Secretary's contribution to those, it seems that an understanding could be arrived at on the workings of international protection and people's responsibilities in that. Of course, the issue is wider than the European Union. Vast numbers of the world's countries are signatories to the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there are challenges for the convention and the UNHCR as they approach their next 50 years. The convention was written for its time and did not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
appreciate what cheap, mass travel would mean for movement, nor that we would be living in a global world. Such issues are large ones, for worldwide consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is slightly peripheral, but important none the less. The Commission's document refers not only to asylum but to extradition. Paragraph 1.1 refers to article 19(2) of the European Union charter of fundamental rights, which provides against removal, expulsion or extradition
	<br><q><p>"to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman … treatment".</p></q>
While we all understand that people should not be returned to countries where there is a genuine risk of torture, will the Minister comment on that reference to the death penalty, perhaps after seeking appropriate advice? Will there be a problem with the possible extradition of criminals to jurisdictions, such as the United States of America, where they are wanted and where the death penalty is on the statute book?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take a huge risk before my officials come back. I may have to correct this, but I understand that we will not return people to countries that have the death penalty. I will return to that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first part of the document is a series of statistics. To what extent does the Minister expect that we will use those statistics, given that some of them appear to be dubious? They include nothing about people given exceptional leave to remain or another subsidiary status, or those who have won appeals. Are the statistics not rather misleading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right in that there has been much discussion about statistics. The Swedish presidency is concerned to have a much better base for statistical comparisons. It can be difficult to make meaningful comparisons between different member states and we welcome the fact that the communication envisages a better basis for the collection and use of statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that we have exhausted questions well within the allotted time, so we now move to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
	<p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13119/00, a Commission Communication on a Common Asylum Procedure and Uniform Status for Persons Granted Asylum; and supports the Government's active participation in the debate on the Communication and the Government's intention to participate in measures which would lead to the establishment of a common European asylum system, without undermining the integrity of the UK's frontier control.—[	<i>Mrs. Roche.</i>]</p>
	<p>11.25 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the question session helpful. I also found the Commission's document helpful in flagging up some of the important questions relating to asylum policy,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
which is something that Britain and other European countries will have to debate in forthcoming months and years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the Commission's proposals are sensible. They cover the subjects that western European countries facing similar problems because of migratory pressures should be considering together. My chief concern is the way in which the Commission and the Government are prepared to seek remedies to the problems that we face due to the abuse of our asylum system through Community legal instruments rather than through inter-governmental co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right and proper common sense that EU member states, and indeed other European countries such as Switzerland which also face migratory pressures, should work closely together. We should find out whether there are ways in which we can grapple with the challenge together. It is a challenge that will require a response not only in terms of detailed measures relating to procedures, reception and enforcement, which are the subjects of today's paper, but in terms of development and foreign policy, which we debated in this Committee last week when we considered the general effect of migration on the continent of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the Government risk locking us in a system whereby they permanently surrender control over our asylum system to supra-national institutions. The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) asked whether it was compatible for the Government to declare that they want a common asylum system throughout Europe, but at the same time to retain control over the frontiers of the UK. At some stage, a choice will have to be made. In my view, and that of my party, that decision should be firmly in favour of defending the right and authority of the Government and the British Parliament to control entry into our country, and to be held accountable by the British electorate for policy decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to the Government's motion, although I have no problem with the idea that the Government should play an active part in debating the Commission's proposals with our European partners, I do not agree with the declared objective set out in the motion that we should look forward to a common European asylum system. That is not a desirable objective, at least not in the way in which the Commission envisages in its paper. I hope that during the detailed negotiations, the Government will not lose sight of the difficulties that have been encountered over the years, which will not be resolved simply by transferring competence to a European level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read carefully the Commission's paper on the operation of the Dublin convention. The Minister is right to say that that convention has not operated in the way that was envisaged. I took particular note of the reference in paragraph 45 to the evidential difficulties that are involved in demonstrating that an asylum seeker is the responsibility of one particular country. In its review, the Commission drew attention to the fact that two different types of evidence could apply, probative evidence—whereby a person had a travel document showing clearly that they had come to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
the United Kingdom from another country and had claimed asylum there—or what the Commission termed indicative evidence, which I take to mean might be no more than the fact that the person seeking asylum had stepped off a ferry at Dover and the indicative evidence was that he had come from France, a safe country, and could have made a claim there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission, in rather roundabout and diplomatic language, drew attention to the fact that different countries have different standards in the sorts of evidence that they are prepared to accept before they will agree to take responsibility for a particular case. I do not see how simply substituting a Community instrument for a convention that is binding in international law will solve that problem— unless a whole sequence of individual asylum cases is brought before the European Court of Justice for it to issue a binding judgment on a particular member state's Government in a particular case. It is essential to overcome that evidential problem, regardless of how we seek a remedy to the problems that have arisen in respect of the practical implementation of the Dublin convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading through the paper, I felt that although there is a great deal of sense in some of its practical ideas, running right through it is the institutional ambition of the Commission to extend its remit further. That is found in its starkest form in the statement on page 7 that
	<br><q><p>"Divergent asylum policies in the different Member States must disappear".</p></q>
There will be no gain to the United Kingdom in giving up control of our own asylum policy. There will be no benefit in creating a common European asylum system if we are left in a position whereby a country such as France does not adequately enforce the rules and is not prepared to take responsibility for the people who are present within its borders. An alternative way forward would be through inter-governmental co-operation, rather than a post-Amsterdam arrangement of the sort that is envisaged here. Above all, our Government and the Governments of the other member states need to focus on the detail of the enforcement measures and the legal arrangements governing asylum. Unless we get those details right, no amount of high-falutin aspirations or grand statements of principle will bring about any improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, this is an important document. My party has long argued for the need for better co-operation among EU states on the subject of asylum seekers. The Kosovo war showed that an agreed system of responsibility-sharing among EU countries—that term is better than "burden sharing", because we should not regard the problem as a burden—can help to spread the load. If we are to adopt such a system in non-emergency situations as well, we must have EU-wide co-operation and procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Obviously, common procedures and approaches are in the interests of each member state and of asylum seekers. I am confused by the approach of the hon. Member for Aylesbury, who seems to want co-operation within the European Union provided that the United Kingdom always wins. Such an approach treats what is supposed to be a co-operative venture as a football match that one side must win. We do not believe that common procedures and standards would lead to a fortress Europe. The statistics are woefully inadequate, but they none the less show that the developing world already takes more than its fair share of the world's refugees. Europe must also play its part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we cannot know the legitimacy of a particular application until it has been examined, it is strange to hear Conservatives referring to bogus asylum seekers and unfounded claims before the claims in question have even been processed. All applicants should be treated equally and with dignity. The United Kingdom should not try to be the least attractive destination in the world for refugees, but that is the bidding war in which some members of other parties are apparently involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to some of the issues on which I have probed the Minister. Clearly, the primary concern for anyone genuinely seeking asylum is to reach safety and protection from persecution. However, I do not believe that it is incompatible with such primary concerns to seek a country in which one might feel more at home because of language, knowledge or historical or cultural links. To leave one's home, possessions, family, business or job and seek protection in another country is not an easy decision to take. It is therefore perfectly legitimate for such people to seek a country in which they are more likely to settle, rather than one with which they have no links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said, having the best asylum procedures and the most generous refugee status is of no use to refugees unless they can gain access to territory and admission to those procedures. The Minister's remarks about the UK's opting out of common procedures that might weaken our frontier controls give rise to a concern that the Government might not be totally committed to our taking our fair share of responsibility for refugees. It is clear that the Conservative party puts a higher priority on controlling entry to the UK than on its responsibility to the world's persecuted people, but I hope that the Minister will make it clear that that is not the Government's view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me reply immediately to the hon. Member for Taunton. With the greatest respect, I cannot understand how anyone could have listened to or read the Home Secretary's recent thoughtful speeches—in Lisbon last year, and in London this year—on the future of the convention without concluding that we are wholeheartedly committed to the fundamental right of people to claim asylum. We are also committed to building support for those in dreadful circumstances who are genuinely fleeing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
persecution and have no choice other than to leave their homes. Indeed, the Home Secretary's remarks on resettlement, in particular, made it clear that we are looking at the matter in a European context, and such an approach is repeated by the Commission in the document before us. No one can doubt that we are very committed in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Home Secretary's comments show that we are fundamentally committed to the right of people to seek asylum. Will she confirm that we are fundamentally committed to the right of people to seek asylum in the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, because we are a signatory to the convention and that is what being a signatory is about. The hon. Lady must appreciate that undermining the convention would do it no good. I am certain that she, like me, is a passionate believer in the right to claim asylum, so she will not want the convention to be undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with a couple of other matters. The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked about Eurodac. As I said, it covers those seeking asylum and illegal entrants who are detected at, or near, the border. It may take a year or two fully to implement, but as the hon. Gentleman will know we are making our own arrangements in that regard. He also asked about extradition and I took something of a risk with the answer that I gave. However, I am glad to say that my information was correct and I am breathing a sigh of relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
This has been a good debate, and both Government and Opposition Members have asked good questions. I can assure the Committee that, in our discussions with the Commission and other EU member states, the Government will take account of the points that were raised today. Indeed, that is why proceedings such as these add value to the process of government. As I said at the outset, the harmonisation of European asylum policies and procedures is a matter of great political importance. As work towards a common European asylum system continues in the coming years, it will be vital that the UK plays a leading role in shaping its development.

I am not entirely sure where the deliberations of the hon. Member for Aylesbury were leading. I should also say to the hon. Member for Taunton that the UK's opting in to all the provisions on asylum and stage 1 that have been initiated so far shows the Government's stance in that regard. We feel that it is important to have a common policy and I hope that the Committee will support the Government in our efforts to take a full and active part in the process that lies ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i></p>
	<p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13119/00, a Commission Communication on a Common Asylum Procedure and Uniform Status for Persons Granted Asylum; and supports the Government's active participation in the debate on the Communication and the Government's intention to participate in measures which would lead to the establishment of a common European asylum system, without undermining the integrity of the UK's frontier control.</p>
