	<div class='title'>Motor Vehicle Distributors</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the European Commission's review of the vehicles block exemption. The purchase of a car is perhaps the second most expensive purchase many of us will make. Continued maintenance and servicing of the vehicle is another major on-going expense, as anyone who has a car will know. Both activities are affected by the provisions of the EC's motor vehicles block exemption. The future of the European car distribution regime is a matter of great concern. All branches of the motor industry—manufacturers, dealers, component manufacturers, independent repairers—have strong views on the subject. So, of course, do us poor consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of introduction, it may help if I sketch in some of the background. The European Commission report is a review of the workings of the current system of new car distribution in the European Union. That review was undertaken by the European Commission, and it was planned when regulation 1475/95 was introduced. Indeed, the regulation contains a commitment to undertake the review. In layman's terms, regulation 1475/95, which is known as the cars block exemption, exempts car distribution agreements between suppliers and dealers from the general ban on anti-competitive agreements under article 81 of the EU treaty—an extraordinary arrangement. The block exemption allows motor manufacturers to structure their distribution networks on the basis of selected dealers with exclusive rights to sell the manufacturer's products in a given territory, known in short as selective and exclusive dealerships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 1475/95 replaced and amended an earlier regulation. An important aim was to enhance the power of dealers, independent parts manufacturers and consumers as against that of the car manufacturers. Another aim was to encourage greater cross-border trade in motor vehicles. From a United Kingdom point of view, serious concern about the operation of the selective and exclusive distribution system began to emerge in the second half of the 1990s, as sterling strengthened. The European Commission's regular surveys of pre-tax car prices across the EU began to show the United Kingdom regularly to be the most expensive market in Europe for most makes of car. Furthermore, prices remained high even though a high proportion of cars sold in the UK are imported and a strong pound ought to have exerted a downward pressure on prices. That is a mystery. In principle, suppliers importing cars into the UK ought to have
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
been able to maintain their profit margins in their domestic currency by selling cars in the UK for lower sterling prices, but such price competition did not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there were complaints that manufacturers were finding ways to make it hard for UK residents to purchase cars cheaply abroad for import into the UK, implying that the single market was not operating well in this sector. In 1998, in its first report, the Trade and Industry Select Committee criticised the operation of the selective and exclusive distribution system. Following a detailed investigation, the Director General of Fair Trading referred the market for the supply of new cars to the Competition Commission in March 1999. That report was published last April, and its conclusions were clear. Many selective and exclusive distribution system practices permitted by the block exemption were found to operate against the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present version of the cars block exemption will expire at the end of next September. The review undertaken by the European Commission was designed to assess how the present regime is working in relation to its aims. Inevitably, the review's findings also set the scene for discussion on what may be put in place after that date—what I shall refer to as the successor regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad conclusions of the review are clear. The present regime has failed to fulfil its aim of protecting the rights of consumers in the single European market. It has permitted practices that allow manufacturers to segment the single European market on national lines and to operate price discrimination. It has failed to enhance the position of dealers. Problems remain in the after-sales and servicing markets. Finally, the present system is not well adapted to innovative retailing methods such as internet sales or sales through non-traditional channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission's conclusions raise serious question marks over the justifications that have traditionally been advanced for excluding motor vehicle distribution from the normal operations of competition law and allowing the establishment of selective and exclusive distribution systems in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What of the future? The debate on the shape of the successor regime has already begun. The Commission held an open meeting in Brussels on 13–14 February at which a wide range of interested parties were able to set out their positions, and is commissioning a study of the potential impact on the European motor industry as a whole of a variety of different future regimes. That will no doubt inform its proposals for a successor regime. We expect those proposals to be put to member states for comment some time this autumn. Revised draft proposals are expected to be published towards the end of the year. There will then no doubt be further debate, in which all interested parties can put forward their positions, before a final text of a new regulation is adopted some time next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not have any hard and fast blueprint for the shape of a successor regime. That is not to say that we have no views on the subject. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
support the European Commission's conclusion that the regime is failing consumers in important ways—after all, that is in line with the findings of our Competition Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made it clear that we believe that radical change is needed to the EU regulations that govern the arrangements for the distribution and sale of new cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the comments made by Commissioner Monti last year to the effect that the car distribution regime in the EU should be reformed in a way that puts the consumer in the driving seat. However, we do not have any settled views on the precise content of such a change or a checklist of points that a successor regime will have to contain. The European Commission, the United Kingdom and no doubt other member states are currently in the middle of a thorough consultation exercise involving all sectors of the new-car market as well as consumer representatives. That exercise will help to shape the views of the Government and the European Commission on successor arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need hardly stress the importance of the market for motor cars in the UK. It is extremely important that we get the structure of distribution right, for the benefit of consumers here and across the EU. The European Commission review that we are considering performs a valuable role, as it highlights the shortcomings of the present system and helps to inform our discussions on how best to achieve the radical reforms that are clearly required. The Committee's debate will make an important contribution to the consultation exercise, and I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 for questions to the Minister. They should be short and one at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first declare an interest from my curriculum vitae. I spent six months in Directorate-General IV of the European Commission, dealing mostly with joint ventures but also all aspects of competition policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain what benefits to the increasing parallel imports of cars would result from the abolition rather than the renewal of the block exemption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be many benefits. I am glad that the hon. Lady is here to give us the benefit of her experience and expertise as a member of the body that considered competition policy. She will know that there are some obvious anomalies. The block exemption applies to only motor vehicles, planes and yachts—I may have missed a couple of other items. For an industry with such a central place in the economic and social lives of all our communities, we must keep reviewing and exploring the possibility that there may be better methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the least, great pressures are put on manufacturers and retailers through new avenues such as the internet. We know that many retailers would like to get into the market but feel that they are prevented from doing so. We also know of developments that could pose serious problems in
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
future. On-board diagnostic systems are increasingly built into cars, and the opportunity for the dissemination of technical information about those systems to independent repairers is a serious question. I worry a good deal about the opportunity for consumers to use alternative garages if and when they require them, rather than being tied exclusively to dealers and associated repairers that have some umbilical link to the manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All sorts of benefits could accrue. I am sure that the hon. Lady will agree that, in relation to the present system, it is important that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that the Commission's most recent report, which was released last month and based on data compiled by 1 November, found that the UK was again the most expensive market for all models examined, despite the recent price cuts. Will the Minister tell me why that is the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, this Minister cannot tell the Committee why that is the case. It seems extraordinary. Obviously, it is a source of great concern for the Director General of Fair Trading. He recommended that the matter be referred to the Competition Commission. The commission was adamant that the block exemption lay at the heart of the price differences between the United Kingdom and abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to make it clear in my opening remarks that we find it difficult to understand why prices remain very high when sterling is strong and 71 per cent. of car sales are imported. In some countries with high local taxation regimes, some models can sell for almost half the price for which they are available in this country. We think that the block exemption, through its selective and exclusive distribution arrangements, has certainly encouraged manufacturers to pick and choose the price at which they sell cars in different locations, in what is supposed to be a single market. The subject warrants serious investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Chope (Christchurch) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everything that the Minister has said leads one to suppose that he does not believe that it is at all in the public interest to retain the block exemption in any form. Will he tell the Committee whether he thinks that there are grounds on which it might be in the public interest to retain the block exemption, with regard to the voluminous reports from the European Commission and from the Competition Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am dreadfully conservative in my views on most things. It might be in the public interest to retain the block exemption, if only because it has worked. We have good safety standards, for example. I would be careful to ensure that any new regime that we established in the EU guaranteed that the best features of the current system were incorporated. That does not mean that I support the status quo 100 per cent.—I certainly do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
not, as I have tried to make clear. However, it is important that we do not react in a knee-jerk way and dismiss the status quo as completely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note, from the discussions in Brussels, that few organisations were in favour of completely discarding the block exemption. Even the Consumers Association was sceptical about throwing everything away. However, those organisations stated that the system needs a radical overhaul and review, if only because, as I told the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), there are new pressures on the market. New demands are being made on the way in which cars are sold, the ways in which they are viewed, and the ways in which after-care is dealt with. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must be careful about discarding the whole thing. We must review the matter seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Borrow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us about the views of our EU partners? He has explained that, in the UK, concern about the block agreement has arisen because of currency fluctuations in recent years, which have not been reflected in price changes for new vehicles in the UK. Are those concerns reflected in other EU countries, or are those countries relatively happy with the agreement? Are the currency fluctuations in the UK the main cause of the dissatisfaction, and is the issue therefore more to do with the effect of the those fluctuations on the UK car market than the block exemption structure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question, because there are differences in the way in which other EU states view the question. Their positions are surprising. I had assumed that the big producers—Germany, France and Italy—would be of one voice. They certainly are not. Much concern has been expressed about some practices. For example, some time ago Volkswagen was fined almost £60 million for telephoning dealers in Italy and telling them not to sell cars to Germans or Austrians because the market was different in Italy and their cars were cheaper there. Opel Netherlands was recently fined £27 million for involving itself in broadly similar practices. In this country, Volvo escaped by the skin of its teeth when it revealed some very dodgy practices. Among other things, it was warning retailers and dealers not to give discounts under certain circumstances or they would not get new Volvo cars. However, the company admitted that before the Competition Act 1998 came into force and saved itself a good deal of grief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a problem throughout Europe; but it is interesting to note that many different taxation regimes apply across Europe. For example, Denmark has a taxation add-on of 200 per cent., and the price of a Ford Focus in Denmark is mysteriously half the price of one purchased in the UK. That car is priced differently in Germany and Sweden, yet the distribution arrangements are the same. Cars are global products. They are traded all round the world. They are made in various parts of the world, but the components come from all over the place. It is strange
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
that prices can vary dramatically from one market to another when they might be only a couple of kilometres apart across a border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a big worry right across Europe, but the UK probably has had the most acute and certainly the most highly publicised difficulties. Sterling has certainly added to those difficulties, but I do not think that it is the major driver of the EU review and hence of our debate today. The worry is more generally about how the block exemption operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Loughton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we up the ante slightly from the Ford Focus to Mercedes-Benz? Will the Minister comment on the implications for the block exemption agreement of DaimlerChrysler's recent decision to rescind all the UK dealerships with only 12 months notice, using emergency powers under the block exemption rules, and concentrate its distribution of those cars in a small number of hands? Will he comment on the implications that that may have in stifling competition for that brand and range of vehicles, whether that move is likely to be followed by other manufacturers, and how much that may have coloured his judgment in his comments on the block exemption review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important matter. He is a free marketeer like myself—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I admit that I am the idiot who wrote the article saying that it was time to bury socialism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, it is for Mercedes-Benz to decide how to rationalise its dealership network. I understand that it wants to concentrate its dealerships into a stronger, more centralised organisation, and that it wants them to stand on their own two feet. It is interesting. I know that the hon. Gentleman will have read the Autopolis report "The Natural Link Between Sales and Service". Exhibit 3.5.1 on page 12 shows the number of dealer networks in Europe. The United Kingdom has 6,500 main dealers, second only to Germany, which has 17,000, but we have more than France, which has only 5,000. However, we have very few sub-dealers—only 800—whereas the French have 18,000. The retail volume per main dealer is interesting. Germany's main dealers sell 120 cars; the United Kingdom's sell 124; and Italy's sell 393. Those differentials are interesting. I have no doubt that someone with a global take on matters might argue that we should rationalise our approach in the United Kingdom. The people concerned are a pretty hard-headed bunch. The Government's dealings with BMW taught us a lot about dealing with the Germans. They do not take prisoners. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Perhaps I should withdraw that statement. They are pretty hard nosed in business. I sympathise with those who lose their job, but that will be a commercial decision for Mercedes-Benz.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of what the hon. Gentleman asked is whether others will follow suit. Will competition be reduced? I think not. I think that the genie is out of the box.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bottle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, then the bottle opens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will force their will on the retailing of cars in this country. They are already searching across frontiers via the internet for better bargains. They do not receive much co-operation from the likes of Mercedes-Benz or virtually any other car company, but they will demand different ways of buying cars and will create new markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Laxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To continue from the previous question, what are my hon. Friend's views on the decision that I understand Mercedes-Benz has taken to place a premium of, I think, 15 per cent. on right-hand drive cars purchased from the United Kingdom—from within the European Union? Is not Mercedes-Benz simply trying to terminate agreements with its franchise dealers and effectively to take control of its market, to force prices up or to stabilise them at a higher level than would have been the case if the existing franchise arrangement continued?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, those are questionable practices, designed to stop people buying cars across frontiers. I know that the Director General of Fair Trading is examining them carefully and keeping his eye on them. He now has the powers, as has Mario Monti, to do something about them, if he decides to. I hope that he will do something, because there is no question in my mind that the supplements prevent people from buying across frontiers, as they should be able to in a single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has raised an important matter, and I hope that he will be heard by the Director General of Fair Trading. I shall ensure that a transcript of our exchange goes to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Commissioner Monti is investigating restrictive practices used by the trade. What representations has my hon. Friend made about that investigation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made a full representation. We like to think that investigations by the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, and our insistence that the European Commission should be kept fully informed of developments, spurred Mr. Monti and the European Commission to undertake their review. They review such matters anyway, but I think that we have added urgency to the proceedings and provided a good focus. The Competition Commission investigation was thorough and excellent. It has been a great quarry for the European Commission, with respect to its method of reviewing what is happening all over the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Competition Commission report was damning. The Minister seems to be suggesting now that there could be some residual public interest in retaining all or part of the block exemption. Will he elucidate? Does he understand that it would be possible for the Government to withdraw unilaterally from the block exemption? Would the Government's
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
policy be to withdraw from it, or from renewal of it, if it did not comply with the recommendations of the Competition Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a pertinent question. Instinct tells me that we should try to move away from it. However, I think that the best way to proceed, given that I have been expounding the virtues of a single market across Europe, is to bring the Commission along with us on this issue. The matter is out to consultation at the moment, as the hon. Gentleman knows. We must move carefully. Nothing tells me that the block exemption ought to survive. Earlier, I tried to point out to him the fact that it is important that any successor regime contains the best elements of the existing one but embraces some radical alternatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister further about parallel imports? Let us imagine an individual such as myself returning from Belgium, having resided there for several years. If I wanted to take advantage of the price differential—the net prices in Brussels were considerably less, taking tax and other costs into account, than those in the United Kingdom, the country to which I was returning—parallel imports should have allowed me to purchase on the same day a vehicle of the same description and to return it to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a feature of the block exemption and competition generally that all sorts of barriers and obstacles are put in the path of such consumers, and they are well known to the Commission in Brussels. Presumably that is also true of the Competition Commission here, given that the Government have effectively applied articles 85 and 86, which are on competition, in the Competition Act 1998. Why is the scandal allowed to persist whereby it is, for example, impossible to buy a right-hand drive vehicle on the same day because barriers such as the six-month delay are put in place to prevent such parallel imports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes an important point and gives us a good example of the iniquities of the present system. As she has done the job in Brussels, I am sure that she understands better than me what an incredibly powerful lobby the motor industry has been and is across Europe. She will also understand the great reluctance of successive Governments here and across the EU, as well as of the Commission, even to contemplate taking on such lobbying groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady will probably not agree, but I think that we have made an important start. The Office of Fair Trading investigation under its previous director general, Mr. John Bridgman, was good and thorough. The Competition Commission has highlighted points such as those that she has made this morning. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has asked the European Commission vigorously to enforce existing rules on cross-border purchases and to take action if manufacturers or dealers breach their obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has already fined companies for obstructing parallel imports, and further cases are under investigation. To fine a company in that way is one thing, but to obstruct on a day-to-day basis
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
customers' ability to do what the hon. Lady wanted to do is another, and it is difficult. Consumers often do not report such matters. They do not feel that they have a collective voice in that sense. It is important that Governments take action, which is why we are complaining to the Commission and will continue to do so. In the end, I suspect that the practices will be eradicated only when we get rid of the block exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to quote briefly from the Select Committee on Trade and Industry's first report on car pricing. The Committee concluded that the link between sales and after-sales service and servicing no longer seemed to exist. The Consumers Association, in evidence to the Select Committee, of which I am a member, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We still believe that servicing among the franchised dealers is no better than servicing among independent garages",</p></blockquote>
and concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"local standards are lamentable".</p></blockquote>
In fact, the Minister's Department noted in a report that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Low customer satisfaction with franchised dealer after-sales service has been an historic weakness of the UK distribution sector".</p></blockquote>
The Trade and Industry Committee came to the conclusion that there was general dissatisfaction with the services provided by garages and that it had seen no evidence that franchised dealers were making any contribution to providing better customer service. Would the Minister care to comment on that view, in terms of the block exemption arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with every word of it. It makes a very important point. I know from experience—and I am sure that if we were to conduct a straw poll in this Room many would agree with me—that the standard of after-care, whether in repairs or servicing, that I have received on the rare occasion when I have bought a new car has been no higher from the franchised dealer's repair shop than from the little garage round the corner that I now use. I see the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) looking very glum as I say this. However, the prices have been radically different. What is more, my ability to go back to the little garage round the corner to say that something is not quite right, and my relationship with that business, is very different from the relationship that I might have with a big franchised dealer. I do not swallow the argument that companies advance about the proposal signalling the end of their ability to undertake complicated jobs. In any case, they should not have to undertake complicated jobs on brand new cars. It is a dubious argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report from Autopolis, "The Natural Link Between Sales and Service", makes an excellent read. Page 16 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The older the car gets, the more likely its owner is to purchase service and parts from independent providers."</p></blockquote>
It shows dealer service retention profiles for Germany and Italy and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even in Germany, where franchise dealer service retention is probably higher than anywhere else in the world, there is a perceptible fall-off in loyalty after the first ownership cycle. In
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Italy, at the other extreme, the franchise networks never even capture half the market from the beginning of the vehicle's life. The UK lies somewhere in the middle, with high loyalty during the new car ownership cycle (largely dominated by corporate ownership) but a steep fall-off thereafter…because fleet vehicles entering the second-hand car market are mainly cut off from their supplying dealers."</p></blockquote>
That is important. I should like to remind my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) that, as technology advances and cars have self-diagnostic systems on board, we must find a way to disseminate such technical information and specifications so that we can have a truly competitive market in the after-care of motor vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that he does not want to throw out the existing regime, but to create a new one that incorporates some of the best features of the current one. Can the Minister give examples of redeeming features in the existing regime that might be so incorporated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can. My great friend, who has the garage around the corner from where I live, has ideas about how a garage should look—very different from the salesroom of the franchised dealer down the road. That matters. Brand matters. That image of technologically advanced consumer products is important. I would like some attention to be paid to that. If we open that market, perhaps that will eventually happen anyway—perhaps dealers and repair garages will pay much more attention to the image of their businesses. Image is an important feature of a hugely important industry that employs roughly 760,000 people. I do not want the industry to become ramshackle. Car manufacturers and dealers have made innovative changes to the way in which they present their product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will forgive me when I say that his response to the specific question of the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) was rather woolly; the hon. Member asked what the redeeming features of the existing scheme were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier, in response to one of my questions, that the Government should be able to take the Commission along with it, suggesting a leadership role. What leadership role are the Government taking? The Minister said that the Government had no hard-and-fast blueprint. He gave the impression that the Government were shrugging their shoulders and leaving the matter to the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I gave the Committee that impression, I apologise. We have officials, who may or may not be present, who play a big part in the deliberations of the Commission. We played an active role in determining the way in which the Commission examined the block exemption throughout Europe. We have made it clear, in our analysis of the reports of the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, that we think that the block exemption regime has serious shortcomings. If the hon. Gentleman had pressed me further on the question
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
that was asked by my hon. Friend, I would have found it difficult to give him another example of a redeeming feature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have seen the Retail Motor Industry Federation's briefing on today's sitting. Looking forward to the new block exemption, should it be established, the federation raises the issue of contract termination notice periods, which is relevant to the issue of the Mercedes-Benz UK dealers. The federation suggests that the period of notice given to dealers should be extended to five years, and that the period of notice given by the retailer to the manufacturer should be two years. Given the investment that is required at dealership level to compete with larger outlets, moves in that direction might be appropriate, to create a balance between the two sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sceptical about the way in which the voice of dealers is being projected. The sector is filled with trepidation about sounding off against their suppliers. They are closely tied to those suppliers—the big car manufacturers—and their freedom of movement is constrained. I have noticed a big difference between dealers' private pronouncements and their public utterances. Frankly, I do not believe a lot of what I hear. I do not want to go any further than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like retailers in many other areas, such as the high street, where the markets for groceries and clothes have changed, car dealers should look reality in the face and become more creative in determining their future. Otherwise, they will be tied to the manufacturers, as they have been for many years, in a way that is not entirely healthy. They may see that as their only lifeline, but I think that there is life beyond it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made some positive remarks about cross-border trade. As he will be aware, under the competition laws, it is open to an individual who feels aggrieved to make a formal complaint to the Commission. In view of what he said, would he be minded to support an individual complaint, in an official Government capacity? That would lend some weight to the proceedings and perhaps produce consequential developments to open up the cross-border trade even more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to talk to the Director General of Fair Trading about the matter, and about how we might approach the Commission with respect to individual cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister consider withdrawing now, unilaterally, from the block exemption, to put pressure on the Commission to achieve the changes that he considers necessary? He says that the present regime has hardly any redeeming features, and purports to speak on behalf of consumers, who are being ripped off under the existing system. Why do not the Government withdraw unilaterally now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to explain why. It is important to complete the current consultation period. However, if it appears that the European Commission, or the European Parliament, will not be prepared to make any changes, the Government will have the will to declare the arrangement iniquitous. We would seriously consider getting rid of the block exemption in the United Kingdom—unilaterally, if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the evidence that has been presented this morning and that is contained in the reports shows that there is not really a single market in dealership. Anyone who was reflecting on the benefits of EU membership might develop a sceptical view of the operation of the single European market from that evidence. Does my hon. Friend agree that radical change is important, so that a genuine single market in car dealership can be established?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several sectors in the single market trouble me greatly, and detract from the general vision of a single market. Energy is one. It is difficult to trade energy with certain countries. The block exemption on cars is certainly another factor. It detracts from the appeal of a single market and, in the end, militates against car manufacturers. In an increasingly globalised economy, if they are not pressed to innovate constantly, and if they hide behind protectionist walls, it is not only consumers who suffer. The industry suffers from the fact that it is not advancing as speedily as it should in the face of open competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very useful table appears on page 112 of the bundle referred to as exhibit D, which is a car price differentials economic analysis, prepared in November 2000 for the European Commission, but whose conclusions are not necessarily supported by it. Table 23 gives the average gross dealer margins across the European Union over a three-year period that includes the introduction of the present regulation in 1995. Interestingly, in Denmark, where I understand the net prices remain among the lowest in the European Union, the dealer margins are also among the lowest. In the United Kingdom the figure is slightly below average, but still more than 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will see that the UK margins decreased from 17.5 per cent. in 1993 to 12.5 per cent. in 1999. Does he attribute that in any way to the workings of the present block exemption? Will he hazard a forecast about how non-renewal of the block exemption would affect dealer margins, particularly in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I look at those figures I wonder—as, I am sure, do other members of the Committee—why the dealers seem to speak with a single voice across Europe. There are serious variations. Dealers' ability to make money—which we want them to do: we want them to run successful businesses—becomes less transparent year on year rather than more transparent. The variables that go into the profit equation become more difficult to understand, not easier. That is bad. Margins have been reduced, and bonuses have been introduced. We have also seen the pre-registration scam in operation, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
often militates against dealers. Ultimately, it tends to cloud the whole picture, not only on whether dealers can make a good honest living and can make forward projections, so that they know where their businesses are likely to be over the next year or two, but on whether consumers are able to discover what the real price of a car should be. The hon. Lady is quite right. It is largely a mystery, but the magician is fundamentally and powerfully the manufacturer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask whether the Minister or his Department were represented at the meeting organised by the Commission in February, and whether he has received reports about the fact that, following the statement that he made at the behest of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, the UK parliamentary representative, Mr. Stanton, received the equivalent of a standing ovation for the lucid and pertinent points that he made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that Mr. Chris Stanton made some good points, and he faithfully reflected the feeling of the Select Committee. He made a good contribution to that meeting. We try hard to be properly represented at all such meetings and, whenever possible, Ministers try to attend. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured; we are very concerned about the subject, and we are determined to play our part in deciding what the successor regime should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the Minister to move the motion, I should inform the Committee that I have selected the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Ochil (Mr. O'Neill) and others. I assume that everyone has a copy of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
	<p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13889/00, a Commission report on the evaluation of Regulation (EC) No. 1475/95 on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of motor vehicle distribution and servicing agreements; and welcomes it as a useful contribution to discussions on the future shape or car distribution arrangements in the European Union.—[	<i>Dr. Howells</i>]</p>
	<p>11.22 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Page	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should declare all sorts of interests—left, right and centre. My whole working life has been connected with vehicle manufacturing or vehicle retailing, sales, parts and servicing. I have derived and continue to derive income from it, and I sincerely hope to acquire even more. To do that, we must have in place a fair and reasonable operating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The block exemption has been portrayed as the guilty party. It has been a little like the curate's egg—bad in parts but sometimes good. The manufacturers have had a grip over dealers in particular areas, and in return for that, the manufacturers have put in place various obligations, which are generally for the consumers' benefit. For instance, they are obliged to run a demonstrator force; to train technicians to be properly skilled in the techniques and problems of the vehicle; to have warranty systems so that when
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
something goes wrong with a car it can be dealt with properly; and to have a recall system to cope with crises in the construction and design of vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manufacturers, of course, sometimes behave in a somewhat draconian fashion. For example, they force dealers to deal only with the manufacturer's finance company if people want to use hire purchase or lease a vehicle. They also force dealers to have particular stocking levels. Indeed, until relatively recently, one manufacturer forbad a dealer to operate with any other franchise within a 30-mile radius, which one could regard as a remarkably stern penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the problems that we suffer today lie in the Government's hands, not only the present Government but Governments over the years, because they have used the motor trade and the motor car as an economic tool. Just as the Government use the Monetary Policy Committee to operate interest rates, they used the car industry—by purchase taxes and similar taxes—to regulate the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With high personal taxes—this is the genesis of our problems today—people began to get their vehicles through their companies. We all know that, if people do not pay for something themselves, they will have to be remarkably saintly to express great concern about the price—they are more interested in the product coming their way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vastly different pattern of purchase developed between the United Kingdom and the continent. That raised prices higher than they needed to be, bolstered by the fact that we had some of the most remarkably inefficient, low-production plants in the world. That created a price umbrella. In order for our plants to be productive, the price had to rise. When cars came into full production, all the other countries of the world came in under that umbrella, rather as steel companies did with British Steel in the 1970s and early 1980s. That was the culture that was built into our country then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then production went up all round. It was interesting that, when manufacturers got together with their dealers and predicted their market share, if one added it all up, the market was going to grow by 20 per cent. a year every year. Of course, that never happened. Vehicles became surplus and there were bonuses and extra incentives to sell them at a reduced price. That was fine, until one manufacturer in this country broke the block exemption rules and started to deal directly with large fleet users, circumventing the system. Somewhat unfairly, it sold to the retail customer through its dealer at one price and to the fleet user at another. That gave rise to all the complications with used cars coming back on to the market, with which I shall not bore the Committee. Of course, once one volume manufacturer did that, the others followed. They got themselves on a terrible hook and did not know how to get off it, although they are now trying to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right. I will not say that he damned the block exemption with faint praise, but he made one point about safety, which is an issue that we must bear in mind. A vehicle can be an unguided missile. Manufacturers and Government have a responsibility
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
to ensure that, whatever we put in place of the block exemption—we all accept that it must undergo major modification—safety recalls and warranty can be properly monitored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cars today are ever more complex and technical. While I heard the call to have the market opened for everyone, those who are entitled to service more sophisticated motor cars must have some form of certificate or approval. They need not be licensed by the manufacturer—they can be licensed by another method—but they must meet quality standards, much as we have the CORGI system for gas manufacturing installation, because cars today are exceedingly complex. For example, in one model to be introduced, it will be possible to dial up the manufacturer on the continent, who will download the new engine management system into the car. Those who carry out such servicing work do not have to be the manufacturer's dealer, but they must meet standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shrugged his shoulders in almost Gallic fashion when asked about price differentials between the UK and the continent. The Government and the European Union have been remarkably lax in pursuing the unacceptable differences. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) made some valid and pertinent points. There should be pressure for some fairness and equality over pricing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the Government produced a pile of paper X ft high on the pricing of motor cars. They laboured mightily and brought forth a mouse. The small reductions were welcome, but I know a manufacturer who gave his dealers a 10 per cent. discount to buy the car. It was promptly announced that the discount had gone to 3 per cent. and that there was a price reduction of 7 per cent. plus tax. On the face of it, that seemed marvellous. However, as the dealers make 3 per cent. on the sale of a new car, price reductions count little to individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York that I do not know where such marvellous figures come from, but I assure the Committee that seldom, especially with volume manufacturers, is anything more than 3 or 4 per cent. made on the retail price of a motor car, certainly not the 10 or 15 per cent. that was mentioned. Perhaps a return on capital of 10 to 12 per cent. might be the more accurate figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill (Upminster) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to what the hon. Gentleman has been saying carefully. How does he explain the major price differential between other European countries and the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I obviously failed completely when I said that the genesis was in the past. We produced some of the worst cars and had the lowest productivity, so we had a pricing structure for UK cars that enabled the continent and overseas manufacturers to do rather nicely underneath the umbrella price, which was greater than that on the continent. We still have a hangover from that. It must be properly tackled, as it
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
is unfair to the consumer and to most people trying to retail the product. Other people and manufacturers may disagree with that view, but we are where we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go any further into the issue of the various profitabilities of dealers and so on, except to say that it is a fashion to believe that motor dealers make plenty of money. About 25 per cent. of the main dealers of one of this country's major vehicle manufacturers are losing money, and the number of bankruptcies has been staggering. The specialists—Mercedes, Porsche and so on—make more than 1 per cent. on turnover: they make 3,4 or 5 per cent. The manufacturers are not standing still. As we huff and puff and talk, they understandably want to secure a future in which they can supply their cars, have their cars serviced and ensure that their products are treated and handled with the reliability that they would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, manufacturers are buying dealerships. They have an interesting negotiating technique. They say that they want to buy the business and if the dealer does not want to sell, they say that they will take away his franchise. The technique is wrapped up more subtly than that, but that is the end message. A garage dealership has a limited sales appeal outside of being a garage. Nine times out of 10, the dealer in question will offer the business for sale and go away. Manufacturers are directly buying percentages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another technique employed by manufacturers uses owner-drivers. Under the owner-driver arrangement, a nice, bright young lad or lass—usually a lad—is found. He or she is probably about 30 or 35 and is asked, "How would you like to run your own dealership?" An approach is then made to a dealer, who is told, "We want to buy your business," and it is taken over. The people concerned then install their own owner-driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Garages are quite expensive to buy and even more expensive to run. Even the most humble, pitiful garage will cost £1 million plus. Not many 30-year-olds are walking around with £1 million in their back pocket, so a soft loan is provided to enable them to operate. It will be appreciated, therefore, that a grip will have been placed on the young lad or lass, with respect to the way the business will be run—not for ever, but for the immediate future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem can be perceived in that if we delay, the game will be taken out of our hands. I see the moves. Mercedes has already taken the path in question. I have no connections with Mercedes, but I think that it behaved with a delicacy and tact in this matter that could be open to misinterpretation. Even bigger groups are being created. If we are not careful, I can see that a trend will occur by which even the large medium dealership, as distinct from the medium or small dealership, will be under severe threat and will vanish for ever. Perhaps that would be a good thing. We might want all car retailing to be conducted in the way that Currys and Dixons operate in electrical sales. That is fine if we want it, but let us plan what we want, rather than just standing back and watching what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The manufacturers are, in the main, multinationals, and the Government's controls are therefore quite limited. I have already mentioned one manufacturer cutting the retail price to 3 per cent. You would not want to set up and run a garage or car dealership, Mr. O'Brien, but if you did, you would go there and be given your standard 3 per cent. Perhaps the manufacturer would cut it to less than that figure, which might mean more money for the manufacturing side of the business, while the dealers that it owned would be struggling to break even. They might even lose money, but competition against them would be in serious trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My response to the enthusiasm for getting rid of the block exemption is to say that I can see huge advantages in doing it—aspects of the business have been subject to abuse—but to warn of possible consequences that could leave consumers worse off when we want them to be better off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill (Upminster) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to begin by making a few general points. The papers that we received for today's sitting were much easier to use than in the past. The index on the main report and the way in which the conclusions were set out, were helpful. In the past, a lack of a reliable way of analysing the documents made going through them time-consuming, but it was much better today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to regulation generally. We are often criticised by the Opposition for the extent to which we use regulation. Regulation is necessary in this case. Often, certain business sectors tell us that such regulation is necessary. There is also a consumer angle to the issue, and even the Consumers Association states that there should be some regulation. It is important to underline that regulation can play a role. It needs to be examined and scrutinised properly, and we are participating in that scrutiny today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with the remarks of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) about timing. That is crucial, because the problems for British consumers have been building up since 1985. The industry also needs certainty when planning investment. That is true of both manufacturers and dealers. It would be damaging to the industry and to consumers alike to carry on for too long without the correct set of regulations. It is imperative for the UK, and probably for the other EU member states, that the new regulations, whatever they are, are put in place.

I welcome the debate, because it is an opportunity for us to share our views. Although I am examining the issue for the first time, and have not spoken on it in the House before, it is clear to me that a balance must be struck—that there must be some regulation. The Consumers Association's briefing was helpful in that respect. It states that without some regulation, it would be difficult to protect the competitive nature of the industry. If there were a free-for-all, the armlock that the manufacturers have on the industry would continue. Some regulation is necessary, but it is a matter of getting the balance right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I was particularly interested in the enforcement provisions in the documentation. It appears that, although there have been headline cases in which manufacturers have been fined huge sums, that has not had the impact that it should have had. Those with vested interests have been prepared to flout the law and the regulations, taking huge risks. As a consequence, we still do not have adequate protection for consumers. Page 59 of the main report sets out some examples of enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report gives evidence of British consumers purchasing new cars in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Denmark and Portugal since 1997. A clear market trend of British consumers purchasing vehicles throughout Europe is emerging. Notwithstanding that trend, those consumers have still not received the benefit of the competitive prices that exist in other countries. They are penalised because of the high costs associated with the right-hand drive vehicles that they need. They are penalised by the delivery times when they purchase such vehicles. It is wrong that consumers are being penalised in that way. The Commission's regulations should be enforced to ensure that consumers get their goods when they purchase them, and at the right price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a new set of regulations. It is useful to consider what the Consumers Association's briefing says about what should feature in any future block exemption to ensure inter-brand and intra-brand competition. We have already seen in the example of Mercedes Benz how intra-brand competition can be thwarted. We should learn from current examples. Price competition discounts, product differentiation and access to markets for new entrants are all important, for the reasons that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire mentioned. Clearly, people who get soft loans without protection are in an armlock from which it is difficult to extricate themselves. That does not lead to a good single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need transparency, so that consumers and those involved in the business can see that fairness applies. The underlying thrust of the argument for maintaining some sort of block exemption relates to public safety—again, the hon. Gentleman properly referred to that. Public safety must not be put at risk by inadequate training or investment, so there must be a balance. The question of training and warranties must be addressed in future block exemptions, so that consumers are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to air those views, which reflect what my constituents tell me. They want to be able to look around the market and to get the best deal, but they want some consumer protection. They do not want to be ripped off, but in a business that requires massive investment, there must be certainty of a return for investors—whether in manufacturers or dealers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Chope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, leave out from "agreements;" to end and insert

	<br><blockquote><p>"notes its conclusion that the "natural link" between sales and after-sales service seems no longer to exist; notes further its conclusions that the objective of increasing the commercial independence of dealers has been achieved "to only a limited extent", that independent repairers are being denied access to technical information, and that they offer services at least as good and generally cheaper than dealers; notes further that car buyers still face difficulties when they try to purchase new vehicles in another member state; and, in view of the Commission's clear finding that the justifications advanced in 1995 for the block exemption are no longer valid, calls on the European Commission, in line with the views of the UK Competition Commission, to allow the block exemption to expire in September 2002.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment gives hon. Members the opportunity to give the Executive a lead. The Minister's motion is vague and woolly: it talks about welcoming the Commission report
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a useful contribution to discussions on the future shape of car distribution arrangements in the European Union."</p></blockquote>
However, the Select Committee and the Competition Commission, at the behest of the Government, have reached the unequivocal conclusion that the block exemption should be abolished, not renewed, when it expires at the end of September next year. The amendment explains why that conclusion is reasonable. It includes expressions from the European Commission's report and links them to the UK Competition Commission report. It gives hon. Members an opportunity to give the Government a lead. From the Minister's comments, it appears that, despite their rhetoric, the Government are acting hesitantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister would be the first to admit that when he was asked by the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) what he saw as the redeeming features of the existing scheme, his language was not as crisp as usual. He referred to "brand matters"—the image of technologically advanced consumer products being important—and said that he did not want his local dealer to be ramshackle. Those are worthy sentiments but, I submit, hardly consistent with the Government's avowed intent of giving not just this country but the European Union a lead when the block exemption expires at the end of September next year. If the Government were to accept the amendment, they would be making progress. They would thus have accepted that the existing scheme had no redeeming features and would not have precluded the development of an alternative scheme, perhaps incorporating some of the ideas proposed by the Consumers Association. They would be giving a clear lead that something dramatic and radical needs to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I was not present at the hearing last month in Europe, I understand that many conservative representations were made, saying that we should not get all fussed about it but leave things as they are. The Minister should be alarmed at that air of complacency, and at the evidence that the Select Committee received in Brussels earlier this year to the effect that the Commission does not know what to do. The Minister knows my views on matters European, but this is a good opportunity for the Government to
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
give a lead, and to use the threat of unilateral withdrawal from the block exemption, to which the Minister referred, unless something is done soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard with interest what my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire said from the Front Bench. I have to be careful because Page Motors in Ferndown in my constituency has carried out the servicing on my and my wife's Volvo estate cars very effectively. One has done more than 200,000 miles as a result of the quality of servicing, and the other has done more than 150,000 miles. That is due in no small measure to my hon. Friend's company, and I pay tribute to him and his employees. However, I wonder whether he is not a little too close to the business to be as objective as he is usually. He said that manufacturers are buying dealerships and that we are now seeing vertical integration, which is monopolistic and to the detriment of consumers. The logic that follows from that is that something radical must be done about the present regime before all the independent dealers are put out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced about safety recalls. For instance, one could have product recalls on safety grounds on a whole range of electrical goods; but no one has ever suggested that the only way to ensure that the system works is for dealerships to be owned by manufacturers that are subject to a block exemption from the normal rules of competition. Indeed, I note that that argument did not find favour with the Competition Commission or the European Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that unsolicited testimonial. I have nothing at all to do with that firm; it is other skilled people who do the work, not me. I might not look after the cars as well as they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On safety, it is not only a question of doing the job but of being able to trace vehicles before they can be recalled. A mechanism must be in place to do that. We all agree that the old block exemption system must be changed radically—it is an admirable notion—but it is only half the story. It is all complaint and no solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all complaint, certainly. The solution is expressed in the amendment: we should support non-renewal of the block exemption. Instead of being so vague about it, the Government now have the opportunity to come clean and say exactly what they want to see in its place. Time is running out. If people say that something else should be put in its place but cannot make precise recommendations, the special interests who now benefit from the block exemption arrangements—to the consumers' detriment—will say that as no one has come up with anything better we should continue with the present regime. However, everyone who has questioned the present regime—members of the Select Committee, the Competition Commission and now the European Commission—has concluded that it is unsustainable and acts against public interest in all respects. As an essential first step, the commitment to allow the block exemption in its present form to expire in September 2002 should be endorsed by the Committee, and I hope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire will support the amendment for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not preclude the replacement of the regime with some alternative, but it would give a deadline. It says that we think that the existing block exemption cannot be renewed beyond September 2002, and that unless some hard thinking is done to replace it with something fresh, we shall be dissatisfied and will do our own thing. Someone said earlier that a car was the second most expensive purchase that people make. I always thought that the spouse and the house were the two most expensive purchases, and that the car came third. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear some intakes of breath. I did not refer to spouses of a particular sex, I hasten to add. I know that my wife made a substantial investment when she married me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take such issues seriously in this country, which has such consumer interest in motor vehicles. The Government have made much during this Parliament of how they are on the side of the consumer. Despite that, they have not been able to pass their consumer legislation. Whenever they are in a corner, they continue to accuse everyone except themselves of being rip-off merchants. They commissioned a useful report from the Competition Commission, and I only wish that the Minister would act with more vigour than he has today suggested that he is willing to, which is why I favour the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Laxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, North) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one of the extremely rare occasions—it will probably remain so—on which the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) and I have common cause on a subject. I do not, however, have common cause with him on the general thrust of his contribution, especially its last section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief in drawing the Committee's attention to the amendment. The Select Committee on Trade and Industry reached a view—I believe that the Competition Commission reached the same one—that, as the amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the 'natural link' between sales and after-sales service seems no longer to exist".</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee obtained a great deal of information from various quarters and organisations when undertaking the inquiry into motor vehicle pricing. The unanimous view of its members was that we saw no case for the block exemption regulations to continue beyond September 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was asked whether he would be prepared to withdraw arbitrarily from the block exemption agreement. The amendment does not seek to secure that withdrawal, but would allow the exemption to wither on the vine. I want to reinforce a pertinent point raised by the hon. Member for Christchurch. In our discussions with the Commission on the subject perhaps only four or five weeks ago in Brussels, I detected a clear suggestion that the Commission was not floundering in deciding which way to go, but that it wanted a decisive lead in the consultations. It was not necessarily evasive in its
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
response to our questions, but I sensed that it wanted a lead from the UK. This self-explanatory amendment provides a mechanism to show it a specific course of action. I hope that the Minister and the Committee will support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch on moving his amendment so eloquently, and the Minister on speaking rather briefly to the motion. I should like to declare at the outset my personal support for the car industry, both manufacturing and dealing. The industry makes a major contribution to the national economy and to local economies and employment. Whether or not we have a buoyant car market is frequently considered to be the weathervane of the UK economy.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to place on record the absence of Liberal Democrat Members from the Committee this morning. Perhaps they do not consider it necessary to recognise or support the motor industry's role in the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will refer to exhibit F of the Competition Commission's report on new cars. The report deals with the supply of new motor cars in the UK. It makes several recommendations, and I would have thought the Minister and the Committee would have spent some time on them this morning. It concludes that substantial changes are necessary, and its conclusions are similar to those of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report recommends three alternative courses of action. The first option would be to allow the benefit of the block exemption to be unilaterally withdrawn in relation to individual agreements in the UK. The second option would be to prohibit acts permitted by the block exemption. Thirdly, the block exemption itself could be changed or allowed to expire. Those recommendations are clearly set out in point 1.20. on page 6 of exhibit F. Will the Minister give the Committee some indication as to what further action the Government propose to take, and on what time scale? He should bear in mind that the block exemption will be deemed to have expired, be in need of replacement or in some way have been brought to a conclusion by 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Consumers Association has remained robust throughout each review of the block exemptions, and this occasion is no exception. The association takes the view that the block exemption should be based primarily on what consumers want, and should ensure quality of service and remove the link between sales and servicing. The amendment so eloquently moved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, on behalf of the members of the Trade and Industry Committee, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the "natural link" between sales and after-sales service seems no longer to exist".</p></blockquote>
The amendment also strikes a chord when it goes on to note that
	<br><blockquote><p>"car buyers still face difficulties when they try to purchase new vehicles in another member state".</p></blockquote>
The Committee was able to pursue the matter directly in questioning, and I feel very strongly about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to note the Minister's offer. I took it to mean that, if in the future a member of the public wishes personally to lodge a complaint with the Commission, the Government will consider supporting that claim. That would be a great development. In my experience, few people have had the chance that I have to work behind closed doors, to sit in on some of the Commission's meetings and to hear the evidence that it hears. Simply lodging a complaint can be an intimidating so that offer is welcome. There are still many barriers. It is not uncommon to have to wait for six months for a right-hand drive vehicle from Denmark or Belgium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we entered the common market in 1973, many people thought that it was for the cheap booze and cheaper cars. We seem to have lost out on both counts. One could be said to be the failure of successive Governments and the other a failure of the system, which has been shored up in a succession of block exemptions. I urge the Minister to look at imaginative ways of further opening up the market to parallel imports. We are talking about genuine competition. It does not pose a serious threat because, as the Minister said, we want both manufacturers and motor dealers to earn a living; no one would begrudge them that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am full of admiration for the motor dealers who operate within Vale of York, or who provide services to my constituents. They are operating in a highly competitive market. In this country, we have the highest on-costs and the strongest currency, and we probably have the most rigid regulatory framework, so they need all the help that they can get. However, I do not believe that they need to hide behind the protectionist system of the current block exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the dealers' margins have been reduced. The Minister referred to the introduction of a bonus scheme, which is very welcome. Dealers' margins average 10 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire looks surprised and incredulous at that, but it is firmly documented and we have had no documentation to refute it, so I have no reason to doubt it. That is a very high margin, and if the dealers have any sense, they will put it back into their businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend that she will receive—not from me, but from others who read this debate—details of margins and retained margins, particularly on new cars from marque dealers. In fact, dealers like to sell used cars, because they make more money from the people who buy them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To assist such people when they read the debate, I would pre-empt any comment they wish to make by referring them to table 23 on page 112 of exhibit D, the car price differentials. That is an apolitical study that was made over a considerable time, probably at considerable expense. It should be recognised that UK margins, on average, are down from 17.4 per cent. in 1993 to 12.7 per cent. in 1999. However, they are still incredibly high. I urge the Minister to give some thought to what the impact would be of removing them. Would it be a severe loss to the dealer, or a pecuniary benefit to the consumer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have welcomed this morning's debate. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch in saying that the motion that the Minister moved at no great length this morning is particularly woolly. I hope that he will take the opportunity to give us an idea of where we go from here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very valuable and interesting debate. Many important points have been raised and I repeat my thanks for the opportunity that the debate has offered to explore the views of hon. Members on the important question of the future of car distribution in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to deal with matters in the order in which they were raised. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire gave us the benefit of his long experience in this area. I should like to hear what evidence he has for his assertion that margins are about 3 per cent., compared with the report's claim that they are nearer to 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now seen the reason: that is the gross margin given by the manufacturer; it is not the margin that the dealers achieve, because they give discounts on every car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. That has clarified the position for me. I made it clear at the outset that the Government do not yet have a fully settled position on the dealer regime that could replace the present block exemption when it expires at the end of September next year. With his usual vigour and insight, the hon. Member for Christchurch has said that we should have one, and I agree with him; of course we should, and we will. However, I put it to him, without the usual cliches or trying to score political points, that we have moved quickly. I know that I was worried about the matter when first appointed to this job two and a half years ago. As the hon. Gentleman knows better than I, reference to the Office of Fair Trading and then to the Competition Commission takes a long time. We had some most valuable input from the Select Committee, which has sharpened our focus a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain the timetable to the hon. Member for Christchurch. He will know that the Commission has the lead on changes to the block exemption. I assure him that we will be in regular discussion with the Commission during this year; I understand that it will issue its proposals in the autumn, which means that, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
the hon. Gentleman said, we must move fast and be clear exactly what we want the successor regime model to be. I understand that the Commission's proposals will be made public later this year; we can then all take part in a better informed debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister highlights that important landmark. I hope that he agrees that what is also important is that the Government are able to influence the Commission before it makes its proposals in the autumn. Will he let us know exactly what is happening to that end?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will certainly be forthright and clear in what we tell the Commission. I have tried to suggest to the Committee that I see little virtue in the continuation of the block exemption, but I cannot accept that it has no redeeming features—those on safety, for example, although they need not be part of a block exemption, are important. Safety is crucial for arrangements that affect after-sales and servicing. It is essential that nothing in the successor regime compromises safety. To use a cliche, that is a bottom line beneath which we cannot go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, it is not clear that we require the current limitations on competition in their entirety in order to address safety issues—the point that the hon. Member for Christchurch and my hon. Friends have made. There is no good reason to deny the independent repair sector the information, parts and equipment that it needs to meet its customers' requirements. Customers have the right to choose where to have their car serviced and to be assured that their chosen garage will have access to the parts, equipment and information required on fair terms. That must be guaranteed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On after-sales servicing, the review concludes that, although there are no major problems with the honouring of warranties of cars bought from local dealers, manufacturers have not always informed their dealer networks across the European Union that they are obliged to honour warranties on cars purchased in another member state. That is important. After-sales services provided by dealers do not always meet consumer expectations, although they are often more expensive than those provided by independent repairers. The review also notes that competition in the area is generally confined to the period after the expiry of the warranty, and argues that the so-called natural link between sales and servicing, which was central to the present system, seems no longer to exist. There is no good reason to deny the independent repair sector the information, parts and equipment that it needs to meet its customers' requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) stressed the need for a well-managed transition from the present regime to a properly and
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
fairly regulated successor regime, which will emphasise safety and allow increased and vigorous competition. That is my view too. We should study the situation carefully but quickly, as the hon. Member for Christchurch reminded us. September 2002 sounds distant, but it is not. It will arrive like an express train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) and the hon. Member for Christchurch, who moved the amendment, will be overjoyed to learn that the Government have no problem in accepting it. It sharpens the motion and is a good indicator of our thinking. The Committee will know that it is customary merely to take note of reports such as the one that we have been discussing. However, I am happy to accept the amendment because it reflects the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning's Committee sitting, together with the evidence that we have provided and the determination shown by the Government in their work with the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, signal clearly to the European Commission that we mean business. The Commission's response so far, and especially the response of Mario Monti, conveys a welcome sense that they share our worries about the impact on European consumers of the present regime. We look to them to present proposals for a consumer-friendly successor regime. I hear with alarm hon. Members' reports of the tentative response that they encountered in Brussels. It is important that the Commission should realise that the world is changing fast. Consumers' aspirations and demands are changing quickly. A failure by the new regime to embrace those new demands and aspirations will be to the detriment of consumers and the industry in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
