	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. You will be aware that, in effect, this is the major fisheries debate of the year and the one opportunity that Members usually have to discuss the fishing industry. To my certain knowledge, the subject has in years past sometimes received a full day's debate and, in recent times, been subjected to at least a half-day's debate. I understand why the Government want to conceal the debate in the relative obscurity of this Committee, but do you, Mr. O'Brien, have the right, if you felt it right to do so, to say that this matter should be more properly heard on the Floor of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls). I have taken part in all fisheries debates, which have always taken place on the Floor of the House. They have always been full-length debates, in which all hon. Members have had the opportunity to express their views. Such matters affect the whole of this Parliament. There is an opinion abroad that, because such measures come from Europe, we can do nothing but rubber-stamp them. It is a point of fact that we should have the opportunity to vote against such measures if we felt it necessary to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure Government Front Benchers have heard those comments. They are not points of order for me. I have been summonsed here to chair the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to deal with the points of order that have been raised about the nature of the debate. It is true that it has been the custom to hold this debate on the Floor of the House, but we wanted to hold it prior to the Fisheries Council debate on stocks and quotas. This sitting has therefore become the annual fisheries debate—a custom that I respect. It is important that hon. Members on both sides of the House who represent fishing areas have a say in such matters, and I very much regret that, because of the timing of prorogation, it has not been possible to hold such a debate on the Floor of the House,.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that hon. Members have the opportunity to scrutinise such proposals before the December Council. I was anxious that they had the chance to do so, which is why a Scrutiny Committee has been arranged at short notice to consider the long
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
explanatory memorandum. That is not to say that I do not accept the points that have been made about the need for a full debate. I have raised the matter with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House and strongly put the càse that, as we are holding this debate in Committee prior to the Fisheries Council, we should hold our annual debate in the new year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate my remarks very much on the total allowable catches and quotas, but hon. Members should be aware that—whatever the outcome of the Fisheries Council—there is widespread agreement that we need a North sea cod recovery programme. Indeed, we need a hake recovery programme in the south-west, too. The details of that recovery programme will not be discussed until January. There are important issues to be debated following the Fisheries Council, and hon. Members should consider this debate on the setting of the quotas and TACs as phase one of a multiphase approach to deal with fish stock management in the North sea. I am not the Leader of the House, so I cannot make promises on business, but I sympathise with the points that have been raised and undertake to ensure that my right hon. Friend is aware of the strength of feeling about the need for a proper, thorough debate, in order that a host of issues can be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the second year that the European Commission has produced a single consolidated text instead of submitting more than 20 separate draft regulations covering TACs and quotas. That is a welcome improvement. Sadly, however, that procedure has not speeded up the Commission's proposals. We, as the United Kingdom Parliament, have made it clear that we are anxious to receive the proposals as early as possible so that the industry and hon. Members have time to consider them, and we shall continue to press the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that negotiations at this year's Fisheries Council will be difficult. North sea cod stocks, in particular, are in poor shape. I do not believe that there is disagreement among various parties about that. The main debate will be how to tackle such a problem. The difficulties in this year's negotiations are compounded by the serious scientific advice on the state of a range of stocks and the scale of quota cuts that will be needed if stocks are to be managed sustainably—a matter that demands careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that quotas and TACs are just one approach to fisheries management. I do not want members of the Committee to think that I, as Minister, or the Government think that only one approach should be taken. We should also be thinking of other ways in which to manage fish stocks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No interventions must be made on the Minister's statement. Questions will be taken afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the efforts of the Commission to obtain the advice sooner, the scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea arrived only in November. It has to be analysed,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
and then we will try to make the proposals. The scientific advice of ICES is in accordance with the precautionary approach. It aims to keep stocks well above levels at which they are in danger of collapse. I have made it clear on several occasions that it is important to follow the scientific advice on setting fishery stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the advice from ICES was one of the most severe for a decade. Its advice this year is even more severe. That is of great concern because scientists believe that cod in both the North sea and the west of Scotland is at risk of collapse. Northern hake is also in poor shape. Many other stocks are now also assessed as either outside safe biological limits or as fished at excessively high levels. As a result, scientists have recommended significant cuts for many stocks, including most of those that are important to the United Kingdom industry. Although the situation in the North sea is poor, in many ways it is even worse in the west of Scotland, where the cod stock is close to collapse. Big cuts in the TAC are recommended. The biggest proposed cuts in the TAC are of stocks that are of particular interest to our industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in previous years, no adjustment has been made in the proposals for national quota allocations to take account of the Hague preference, which provides a safety net for quotas of certain species for the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. That device was hard won by the United Kingdom. It is disliked by member states that lose quota as a result, especially when severe cuts in TACs are recommended. The United Kingdom has always acted responsibly when invoking Hague preference, and I am still considering what invocations we should make this year. Above all, I shall be looking for the outcome that best furthers the interests of the United Kingdom industry and promotes the achievement of our objectives in those difficult negotiations. I am looking for an overall package from those discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposals for TACs in 2001 generally follow the advice of ICES but, in several important cases, are even more severe. Moreover, for stocks that are caught together with cod or hake, the Commission is proposing cuts in TACs of 20 per cent.—even when there is no specific advice on them. We would usually expect the TACs to be rolled over. I understand the reason for the Commission's action. It is concerned about reducing efforts on cod. It recognises that it is a mixed fishery and part of its solution to the problem is to reduce the quotas on a range of mixed species that are caught with cod. I do not necessarily consider that that is the right way in which to deal with the problem. Nor do I think that it is justified—an approach that I shall explain in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the proposed cuts, particularly on flatfish and nephrops, are certainly excessive and difficult to justify given scientific evidence. I have made it clear in meetings with the industry that I will base the United Kingdom approach on the scientific evidence. That is right, proper and responsible. Of course, if the Commission is arguing for cuts that are not based on scientific evidence, there is a case for challenging those
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
figures—and that would be my position. The industry is facing a difficult time as a result of the decline of those stocks, and we must not make that worse with unnecessarily severe cuts in other stocks. Instead, we must ensure that properly targeted measures are developed under a cod and hake recovery scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise that seeking less severe cuts than those proposed by the Commission does not mean that we are failing to take the scientific advice seriously. ICES provides it in good faith, and after thorough stock assessment and analysis we cannot ignore it. However, in a profoundly difficult year, it is hard to justify going beyond what ICES is arguing for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would strongly support a North sea cod recovery plan. I am pleased that the industry has made it clear that it wants to work alongside the Commission and ourselves in developing that, and I have made it clear that I am anxious that the industry be involved at all levels, as it has been on the Irish sea cod recovery plan, which, I am glad to see, is showing signs of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North sea cod is going to be the focus of this year's negotiations. Catch levels are already well down. The quota that was negotiated last year has not been fully taken up by the industry. Frankly, it has been difficult to find the cod to catch. There does not seem to be much prospect of an improvement in the cod fishery over the next couple of years. The number of young fish recruited to the fishery in 1998 was by far the lowest in more than 30 years. In those circumstances, not only is a deep cut in the TAC for next year inevitable, but special recovery measures are needed, and we will be talking about those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the TAC for cod was cut by 39 per cent, for 2000, the UK fleet has not managed to catch its full quota, which confirms the problem. It has been suggested that there is now nothing we can do to help the cod recover. The argument is that cod are victims of global warming and that higher sea temperatures have drastically reduced recruitment. That is only part of the story, although it is fair to say that cod tend to breed best when the temperature is lowest. There are now so few mature cod in the breeding stock that fishing has become dangerously dependent on the level of juveniles recruited to the fishery each year, which can vary significantly. Current levels are low, so it is inevitable that there will be exceptionally steep cuts in TACs. We must rebuild that stock and reduce the discards of juveniles. We must tackle that issue and that of juvenile mortality to avoid such variations in TACs and the dislocation that that brings to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ICES has recommended that, in the light of the high probability of the collapse of cod stocks, a stock rebuilding plan is required in the North sea and west of Scotland. There is no doubt that the scientific advice should be taken seriously. The industry accepts that, just as it accepts the northern hake recovery plan. I appreciate the support that we have had from the industry in the Irish sea cod recovery plan, which demonstrates such improvement that there may be a case for arguing for a slightly increased cod TAC in the Irish sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I have grave concerns about proposals from the presidency for deep water species, and I will make sure that that concern is voiced. Given the outcome from the Norwegian discussions—which were fair in the circumstances—negotiations between the EU and Norway are important in setting the scene for proposals on cod, haddock and whiting in the forthcoming Fisheries Council. The Council negotiations might be the most difficult for some years—certainly since I have been the Minister responsible. I recognise the impact and the potential socio-economic impact on the industry as a consequence of some of the cuts. However, stocks are under severe pressure, and unless we take action to deal with the problem it will jeopardise the future sustainability of the fishing industry in the UK and in Europe. I also recognise that TACs and quotas are only one approach. We need to consider the technical gear, the possibility of closed areas and, above all, how to minimise juvenile discards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My objective at the Council will be to secure the best overall deal for the UK industry, consistent with science and the need to ensure sustainability in our fishing industry. I have consulted in some detail with the industry, and I shall have further meetings with it. I want to involve the industry in the discussions to ensure that when we proceed, especially in the recovery programme, we have its input, views and, I hope, cooperation in implementing recovery programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that we have until 5.30 pm for questions to the Minister, which should be brief and asked one at a time to give ample opportunity for us to proceed. We shall move on to the debate at 5.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the proposed savage cuts in quotas to which the Minister alluded and the current fuel crisis and under-investment in the fishing industry, does he genuinely believe that the UK fishing industry has a future, in either the short term or the medium term? If so, what does he as the Minister responsible propose to do to secure that future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do believe that the industry has a future. This is a difficult period; there is no denying that. Fuel prices have impacted on the fishing industry, especially on sections with vessels that have high fuel consumption, such as the beam fleet. However, I disagree about investment. There has been significant investment in the industry, along with much new building, innovation and development of new species and stocks. There are encouraging signs of potential recruitment in stocks such as haddock, which has a good year class coming through. Whiting seems to be increasing, as does saithe, and nephrops stocks seem to be quite good, too, so it is not all doom and gloom. However, there is no doubt that it will be a difficult year for the industry, on top of a range of cuts and increased fuel prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
In examining the implications of the recovery programme, one matter that I shall discuss with the industry, along with the details of the programme, is whether a case can be made for structural measures to help it deal with some of the challenges. I am prepared to sit down and discuss the matter with the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister recognises the impact of the recent fuel crisis on the fishing industry. As he will know, trawlers leaving Whitby have further to go because of environmental problems in the industry. Can trawlermen in my constituency look forward to any short-term aid to help see them through the short-term problems that will be experienced as a result of the package that he is proposing to negotiate at the end of the week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be frank with my hon. Friend: there is not much chance of our giving subsidies for fuel as a short-term measure. We cannot do that; it is not legal, and in many ways it is not desirable in tackling the problems that the industry faces. I recognise the difficulties that the industry is experiencing, to which my hon. Friend has referred on many occasions. We should try to tackle those problems on a permanent basis, and if the industry is experiencing structural and overcapacity problems, we should be working on those aspects. If investment is needed, we should be considering where that investment should go. One area of investment that we should be considering is in quality, to maximise the return that fishermen gain from their catch. Funds are available for that, and I am prepared to discuss the matter with the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he was going to concentrate on the scientific evidence, because the proposal to cut nephrop fishing by 20 per cent. is causing most concern in the north Northumberland and Berwickshire coastal fishery. I was pleased to hear him say that the evidence for such a cut is less than scientific. It seems dubious to cut someone's income by 20 per cent. for the rather fanciful objective of possibly saving some cod in the by-catch. Will the Minister be robust and take a red line with him to the Fisheries Council, and make it on nephrop?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always interested in red lines, as long as people do not step over them. The hon. Gentleman is right: I have made it clear to the industry that I am prepared to take difficult and tough decisions based on scientific research. That will impact on the industry and cause it short-term pain; there are no two ways about that. However, I find it hard to justify cuts that will cause the industry pain when there is no scientific basis. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that that is true of North sea nephrops—I do not see a scientific basis for a cut of 20 per cent., and I will resist it. Although I understand the Commission's position on the impact of mixed fisheries and the need to reduce the effort on cod, there are ways in which to target reduced effort as part of a proper recovery plan.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister, in his master exposition of a disastrous situation, mentioned the Hague preference. We did not invoke that last year, even though it would have triggered an automatic catch for this country. We could have invoked it but did not because the Minister accurately predicted that we would not catch the quota—as we did not. Does he think that we might invoke it this year? Under the Norway-European Union agreement, the cod quota stands at 45 per cent. but, in that agreement, haddock and cod are linked so that, should we catch the quota this year, North sea haddock fishing will automatically stop. Will the Minister invoke the Hague preference to prevent that from happening?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend, who knows the industry well, that the cod and haddock fisheries are linked through the quotas. I stand by my decision of last year in not invoking the Hague preference, for which I was criticised by the industry. The outcome of one's overall negotiating position can become an issue, and I did not feel that invoking the Hague preference was justified for what would have been paper fish. I was not prepared to argue for a quota that the industry could not catch. Frankly, too much of that sort of thing has happened in the past—it has led us into the problems that we face today. Contrary to what the industry often believes, all Ministers want to do their best for it, and its needs tend to influence them deeply. In the past, that has led them to argue for unsustainable positions on quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear to the industry that I want to be guided by science on the question of quota. The position that I took last year has been justified by events, as people in the industry will privately concede, although they did not say so in public. The same will apply this year: invoking the Hague preference is not automatic. I argue strongly that it is a right for this country, which we have enshrined within the principle of relative civility. That is the position that I will take. I will consider carefully how we invoke Hague preference and what the impact might be, but as part of an overall negotiated outcome. We must consider what we want to be the total package of fish stocks for the entire country and all regions of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What horrified people in the west country were not simply the annual, ritually proposed cuts. As the Minister rightly says, the cut proposed was way beyond the scientists' recommendation. Apparently, scientists have said that the stock of whiting is within safe limits in areas VIIb to VIIk. That is a catch of particular interest to fishermen selling out of Plymouth, Looe and Brixham. However, cuts to the quota are proposed. As for sole in area VIId, scientists say that the quota could be raised, but the Commission talks of reducing it. I have seen it stated in the press that fishermen, who after all should know something about the matter, believe that sole in area VIIe are abundant and sizeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The Minister's remarks that his decision will be based on science come as some reassurance. Does he accept that a lie is given to the entire process by the fact that baby fish—fish below the age of reproduction—are not simply a by-product or a discard under the common fisheries policy? It is actually illegal to catch fish below the age of sexual maturity. If the Commission wants to be taken seriously on this matter, it must meet the Minister's objection about sticking with the science as the basis of the system. It is unsustainable for the Commission to posture as it does—saying that it is worried about fish stocks while allowing underage fish to be caught because it suits the eating habits of some EU partners. That is a difficult issue, which must be grasped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult issue, and, unusually, I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman on the matter. The issue of the minimum landing size for a range of species must be addressed, but there is logic in what the Commission says. The minimum landing size is linked with mesh size. If one wanted to raise minimum landing size and cut discards, one would probably have to increase mesh size. Currently, minimum landing sizes are based on fish that are a proportion of the discards happening now—the Commission has made those discards marketable. Changing the minimum land size would not alter the discards. I happen to agree that that approach is not right; it sends the wrong signals. I would prefer a bigger mesh size and bigger minimum landing size. As part of the negotiations, I shall make sure that the change to the Commission's proposals on the minimum landing size for plaice, which we negotiated last year, will become permanent this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the first to admit that the common fisheries policy has its faults. Traditional fisheries management is applied in relation to quotas and TACs in Norway and Iceland, which also have problems with declining cod catches. I am not saying that such management cannot be improved or that we should not address issues such as the juvenile by-catch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne Begg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning on Radio Scotland, a North sea fisherman complained that the quota system was a blunt instrument to control fish stocks. His biggest complaint was about the amount of discards. In his words, we are throwing away perfectly good food. I was pleased to hear the Minister talking about reducing juvenile discards. Will he expand on the proposals, for which he will press, to cut discards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. LAWRIE QUINN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Quota policy is a blunt instrument—there is no denying that. However, we have discussed the matter with other EU members for many years, and it is difficult to find an alternative. There must be a biological limit on how many of a particular species can be taken out of the sea, and there must also be a mechanism for distributing the fish quota among producer organisations and the fishing industry in the UK. Quota management is well understood and easy to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
enforce, which is why it is the traditional form of fisheries management in all countries, not just the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, however, that we must find a more sophisticated approach that involves multi-annual quotas and banking and borrowing, which are being introduced in this country and the European Union. We must also consider the issue of by-catch. Although the fisherman to whom my hon. Friend referred was concentrating on the issue of marketable fish that are discarded because of a closed end of quota, the bulk of the discards are juvenile fish caught as a by-catch of normal fishing methods. We must address that through the cod recovery programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the issue of discards, does the Minister not accept that one of the perverse, but inevitable, consequences of reducing quotas will be to increase discards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily, as it depends on the balance between the various stocks. It also depends on the nature of the recovery plan introduced in relation to effort control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has painted a fairly gloomy picture. I am deeply concerned about the question asked by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), as I think that it is important not to talk the industry down. My hon. Friend will be aware, from his recent meeting with fish processors from Aberdeen, Grimsby and Hull, that the industry has a positive attitude. It recognises that it has temporary difficulties, but believes that it has a future in the long term. I welcome his comments about having a proper debate early in the new session. If, by that time, the Minister has received the report from the Sea Fish Industry Authority on a 10-year strategy for the industry, it should be published as quickly as possible and form part of the debate. In times of crisis or pressure we need a proper debate on the issues that affect the fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a sensible suggestion. He is aware that we have taken up the Agriculture Committee's thoughtful recommendation to develop a strategy for the United Kingdom fishing industry. As my hon. Friend rightly said, that is under formulation; January or February would be a good time to discuss a range of fishing industry issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a difficult year for the industry—there are no two ways about it. But it is important not to talk down the industry and to recognise that because of the measures introduced in the past two or three years—at some pain to the industry in terms of recovery—some stocks are coming back. That is an encouraging sign, which shows that short-term pain can bring about longer-term gain in respect of fish stocks and sustainability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's assurance that he will be sticking robustly to the science in negotiations with his counterparts in
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Europe, especially on the potential collateral fallout in respect of whiting, saithe and nephrops from the necessary cut in the cod quota in the North sea. However, the Minister said little about the impact of the draconian cut in the hake quota, especially in the western approaches. I hope that he will elaborate on that matter, because British fishermen, especially Cornishmen, who catch hake in the western approaches are targeting larger fish; their continental colleagues catch juvenile hake and need to catch 200 times as many to get the same value at landing. That is a serious matter. If the Minister wants a satisfactory outcome for hake quotas for the United Kingdom, he must tackle the issue of technical measures and larger mesh sizes to stop the catching of juvenile fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept the hon. Gentleman's arguments. There is much more of a problem with Bay of Biscay hake stocks than with others. There is a problem with hake stocks generally and I accept the science on it. However, I am not sure that the Commission has interpreted the science correctly; its case for the scale of cuts in respect of northern hake may not stand up to proper, scientific scrutiny and we shall challenge it on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right about hake; I have spoken to fishermen from his constituency about the matter and the juvenile hake problem must be tackled. It is true that in the west country fishermen tend to target the bigger species, which is more selective. A fisherman to whom I spoke did not quite take the point that he was killing the breeding stock—juvenile mortality is high; therefore, killing mature fish has more of an impact than killing juvenile fish. However, the key is to get more juvenile fish to survive to maturity and to breed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. BILL O'BRIEN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's position on industrial fishing? If there are to be strict cuts in quotas and a new regime encompassing closing spawning grounds, different mesh sizes, and so on, all of which are necessary, it is ludicrous that we should also allow industrial fishing. The present system is bound to mean that young, edible cod and haddock are caught, turning the fishing grounds into a primordial soup. Why is industrial fishing not stopped in the crucial areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be stopped. My hon. Friend knows where I stand on industrial fishing, as my views have been consistent for a long time. The United Kingdom has made some progress in introducing closed areas for industrial fishing of sandeels for the first time. The problem, however, is lack of definitive science; when we argue about the matter in the Council of Ministers, it comes down to science and what can and cannot be demonstrated. I feel that, if the bulk of the biomass catch from the North sea is taken as industrial fishing, it must impact on the availability of food and potentially on the juvenile species. The TAC for sand eels is too high and should be reduced. I shall certainly raise that point in the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister speak about enforcement by both EU and non-EU nations? ft would be unacceptable if Britain enforced any agreement to the letter but other nations took advantage of the situation as fish species recovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important consideration, particularly for the proposed deep water TACs which I mentioned. There is a potential problem with deep water stocks. We do not know enough about them, but we know that they tend to grow and reproduce slowly. The presidency proposes to set TACs for those stocks, but the hon. Gentleman is right to say that, under the present proposal, TACs would apply only to the EU fleet. International fleets would not be subject to them. From the UK perspective, it would be better to agree effort limitation measures on deep water stocks through the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission—the international body—so that they apply to all vessels from all countries that pursue deep water fisheries. That is the best way to proceed, and I shall take that approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has often mentioned the problems of junior fish being caught and by-catches, and ways of trying to tackle those problems apart from quotas. Will he say how much closer we are to getting square mesh panels outside Scotland? Clearly, that makes so much sense in tackling the problem as he suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and I applaud the industry-led initiative—it is all the better for that—to introduce square mesh panels. We have submitted to the Commission the regulations for such panels in the English fleet. They have probably come back by now. We will apply that measure to the whole UK fleet as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister recognises that, for every job at sea, there are 12 shore-based jobs in the industry. He is also aware of the thriving recreational fishery. Will the quotas have an impact on that fishery? It takes a negligible catch from the sea, but makes a vital contribution to local economies such as those of Scarborough and Whitby.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As they stand, the TACs apply to all fisheries, including the recreational side. Some rod boats can take significant catches, which is why we need to take into account the potential impact on overall stock management. However, I agree that recreational fishing is an important economic activity around our coast. It has considerable regional importance and is completely legitimate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Totnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Brixham fishermen, who come from the second largest fishing port in England and Wales, recognise that the Minister is doing his best and the difficulties that he faces. However, I wonder whether he recognises the problems that they face. First, the working time directive means that they can spend only so long at sea. Secondly, fuel constraints place an enormous burden
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
on them when they go to sea. Thirdly, their fishing quota will be cut so savagely that they are unlikely to be able to make a profit. Many fishing captains believe that they will not make a profit this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, what does the Minister propose to do? Does he propose a larger compensation scheme? Does he propose that boats should be decommissioned or that some European boats should not be allowed in English waters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have agreements on the latter point; there are rights of access for EU vessels, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Many Brixham vessels do good fishing off the coast of France, so he should also bear that in mind. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that beamers in particular are having a difficult time because of fuel costs, and the beam-trawl fleet also has an overcapacity problem. I am prepared to consider some of those problems, but if it means using public funds I would much rather address long-term problems and try to bring about long-term solutions than subsidise short-term problems, which may not necessarily go away. Such problems may be suppressed for a short time, but sooner or later they will have to be dealt with. I accept the case for some public support, and some money is available through financial instrument of fisheries grant, but it must be used to tackle long-term problems and gain long-term solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to the problem of baby fish and under-age species? If I am right, he is saying that it is a by-catch and discard problem and that it is not caused deliberately. If he were running his own fishing policy in his own fishing waters, he would be able to insist on methods of catching that were far more species-specific than anything that can be achieved now. Although some juvenile species are caught as a by-product, the main reason for their being caught is that a number of our EU partners want to catch under-age fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the Minister can come up with a policy to deal with that problem, simply worrying about the discard will do no good. What has to be done—not even the Minister can manage this—is deal with the eating habits of those with whom we share our fishing waters. Unless he can do something about that, he will have to admit that he cannot do anything about the problem of catching fish below the age of sexual maturity which lies at the heart of our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that some countries have a market for small fish. Indeed, Scotland traditionally has a market for small haddock. However, that does not compare with the very small fish for which markets can be found in Spain and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I like to be optimistic. The European Union has a collective approach to enforcement, part of which is trying to squeeze out the market for small fish through onshore enforcement. The Spanish authorities have been taking quite a hard line. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be the ideal, but even if we had complete control over our own waters and put in place measures to protect juvenile fish there, and remembering that the UK does not have a traditional

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
market for small fish, most of the other countries using the shared waters of the North sea, the English channel and the western approaches would not be included in those measures. Without a Europe-wide approach, our fishermen's efforts would be for nothing. The common fisheries policy offers a potential advantage, because Europe-wide agreement is much better for fish conservation than national measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the proposed deep water quotas. Why are the French using their presidency to push that through? It should be agreed by the North Atlantic Fisheries Commission. If quotas are enforced on EU vessels, that will leave stocks free to be caught by the Faroese, the Russians and others. It seems a barmy proposal. Is it just a piece of perfidious foggery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can understand why the Commission is attracted to the idea of applying TACs to species that could be under threat. However, my hon. Friend makes the fair point that it is rather unfair to EU vessels to have TAC restrictions that do not apply to non-EU vessels in that same fishery. The logic must be to pursue the matter through the North Atlantic Fisheries Commission, and I shall argue for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what the Minister has said, it seems that, if we had control over our national waters, we could impose our own closed areas; indeed, we would probably have done so before now. What is the problem in the Council of Ministers? Having cooperated with our partners in the common fisheries policy for the best part of 27 years, how is it that such common-sense measures have not yet prevailed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not quite right. We have the plaice box and mackerel box, and several areas designated internationally—certainly in the European Union—for conservation measures. There is a case for further closed areas. Whether a closed area will benefit the fishing industry and conservation depends on where it is and what effect it has. Some areas, about which people have talked, where there would be benefit fall outside our limits. To make matters work, we must have European agreement. Fisheries management is much more effective on a European basis than on a national basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that, if the North sea recovery plan is to have any chance of success, we need to take strict action on industrial fishing vessels? Does he agree that there should be an exclusion on industrial fishing in the North sea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I was glad to secure agreement in the Council for the Wee Bankie closed area. In fairness, the Danes were constructive and worked with us in our continuing scientific analysis of that closure. By considering the impact of sea bed feeding inside and outside a closed area, one is able to draw scientific conclusions. That is helpful in relation to the on-going
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
argument about the impact of industrial fleets. There is a strong argument to extend the range of closed areas, and to reduce the total allowable catch and wind down the size of the industrial fleet in the North sea. Our priority should be fish for human consumption. Fish for industrial use are of secondary importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister means what he says about seeking agreement on a Europe-wide basis, does he not notice the growing European consensus that action should be taken about the short-term fuel problems? The Irish Government, like the French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian Governments, are now taking action in their own country. Those countries recognise the fact that, although most people hope that the high cost of fuel, which has risen during the past couple of years, is a short-term problem, significant quota cuts early next year would put impossible pressure on the fishing industry. If the United Kingdom Government could support the industry, albeit in the short term—the Minister has suggested that he is not in favour of short-term measures—it would help to soften the blow of the cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in Dublin last week in bilateral talks with the Irish Minister, and we discussed his proposals. As I understand it, many of the measures relate to the training of fishermen. We have recently announced a commitment of £500,000 to the UK fishing fleet so that we can provide free training for fishermen. We will pay for it. The Irish action is not entirely dissimilar to what we have put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the pressure for short-term measures because of fuel costs. I accept that fuel costs for the fishing fleet are a real problem, but it is difficult to deal with that through a short-term measure. Fuel is tax free for the fleet, so we can do nothing in terms of fiscal measures. We could use other means, and I am not afraid to explore suggestions from the industry, but the situation is not easy. We do not want a subsidised fishing industry in this country or in Europe generally. That would not be good for sustainability or environmental management. The trend, as marked up by the World Trade Organisation, is to move away from subsidies for the fishing industry, especially those that increase capacity while keeping unsustainable parts of the industry going when they would otherwise restructure themselves naturally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues are complicated. I return to my acceptance of the case for financial support of the UK fishing industry. However, I want such support to be clearly targeted with clear outcomes, and to be part of a long-term strategy, not a short-term fix.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decline in stocks is primarily related to fishing, although that is not to say that there are not other contributory factors. Dredging could be one such factor, and my hon. Friend will know that we now apply environmental impact assessments to any application for dredging. We consult the industry, and if we think that dredging in a particular area is detrimental to juvenile fish or breeding and spawning areas, we will not give permission for that dredging. However, the principal reason for the decline is fishing. Sole is a very desirable, valuable fish and many fishermen are keen to catch it, and that is the principal reason for the decline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If fishermen are not to break the law in terms of the working time directive, they will have to ensure that they catch enough fish when they are out at sea, in limited time, using fuel, and they will not be able to make ends meet. In that case, decommissioning becomes a possibility. Is the Minister planning to increase the money available for decommissioning? Will he ensure that every boat that is decommissioned in Britain is also decommissioned in Holland, France and Spain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Dutch have introduced a decommissioning programme for their fleet. It is one of the measures that people have claimed is a fuel subsidy package, but the bulk of the programme is for the decommissioning of beam trawlers because they are having financial problems. The rest of the financial package provides financial support for fishermen using beam trawlers who want to start using other types of equipment. Under FIFG, we can do that ourselves.

I am concerned about the hon. Gentleman's comments about the working time directive. My colleagues in Government and I worked hard to ensure that there was maximum flexibility in the way in which the working time directive was applied. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and other hon. Members who represent fishing areas have also made representations. Most of our fishermen are defined as share fishermen, and are therefore exempt from the working time directive. This should not be a major problem for the fishermen in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may know that there is considerable concern among fishermen that not only does fishing put pressure on fishing stocks, but there are other sources of imbalance in the North sea stocks. Does he share their concern about the abundance of saithe and its contribution to the declining numbers of sandeels, which are a resource for other demersal fish? Would he support more scientific effort to examine whether the saithe stock should be more actively managed, to regain the natural balance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support scientific analysis, and we spend a lot of money on research and development and on the assessment of stocks. During the past 18 months, I have been anxious to involve fishermen more directly in scientific assessment, to the extent that we have invited representatives from the fishermen's
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
organisations to sail on our research ships and to see what happens on board them. They have contributed suggestions and ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been anxious to involve fishermen in the analysis of information and the development of scientific advice. They examine the advice and the figures coming in, and that leads to better mutual understanding. The scientists gain from the practical experience of the fishermen, and the fishermen gain from observing the methodical way in which the scientists collect the information and how they apply it. That does not mean that there are not sometimes disagreements on the interpretation of the information. There is disagreement between the fishing industry and our scientists on the availability of saithe stocks. It appears that those stocks are improving. However, the improvement is fragile and I am not convinced that saithe are as prolific as some in the industry suggest. I am nevertheless prepared to listen to the industry's point of view: it is right to take practical experience as well as scientific advice into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware of the concern among fishery communities in the North sea about the size of the seal population. Will the recovery plan for the North sea deal with that serious concern, which is certainly felt in my constituency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the views on seals expressed by some of my hon. Friend's constituents. In all my ministerial actions—not just those regarding fisheries—I always seek to take scientific advice. I always examine scientific evidence about trends and take particular note of ecology. I have to tell my hon. Friend and the Committee bluntly that there is not the slightest evidence that seals are responsible for collapsing cod stocks. I will examine any scientific evidence to the contrary, but I know of no such evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware from his reading of the trade press of widespread concern that further drastic quota reductions will drive fishermen out of business. Does he not believe that, when people's livelihoods are destroyed by legislation, they should be compensated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is compensation to the extent that, where major changes in employment trends are evident in regions, considerable Government funds are available for retraining and restructuring. I hope that that will not apply to the fishing industry, which I hope will get through this difficult period. If some encouraging signs of stock recovery flow through, the industry should stabilise. That can be done, but I do not doubt that short-term pressures will be significant as a result of the decline in profitability of some sections of our fleet. I understand and sympathise with those circumstances. As I said, various measures can be taken, but they are not designed to provide direct short-term subsidies. There are no structures in place for that. The considerable funding available is intended for longer-term restructuring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still worried about my hon. Friend's position on subsidies and support for the industry. The Irish package mentioned earlier amounts to £11 million, £1 million of which is for fuel efficiency schemes. It provides direct support to the industry. My hon. Friend's answer is dictated more by the financial position of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food than by an aversion to supporting the industry. Will he bear it in mind that, if we do not subsidise our industry and help it to pull through, the catches will be inherited by nations that did subsidise to keep their fleets going?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is a serious point and I accept my hon. Friend's case, but the Department's funds are limited. If major restructuring is required, we shall have to seek a new package. I have to consider circumstances and the potential impact of recovery programmes and MAPG5, which cannot be ignored. I genuinely believe, however, that short-term fixes are not the answer. If there is a case for public support for the fishing industry, it should address long-terms problems to put it on an even keel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know that southwest fishermen were encouraged to freeze some of their quotas this year. Is there some logic to freezing quotas at present levels rather than increasing them? Is that the logic of bankability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that that is the logic. Stocks can be banked only when they are in a favourable position; otherwise it would be impossible to do so. I accept that, when stocks have been banked, that has been done in good faith. I think that banking and borrowing are an improvement in fisheries management and I am keen to defend the interests in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is not prepared to countenance consideration of short-term measures to deal with the industry's problems, perhaps he will consider one conclusion that can be drawn from this year's likely settlement on quotas, given what has happened in previous years. A long-term solution would be based on devolving the responsibility for managing stock in the zones and regions of Europe. For several years, this country's industry has recognised that technical measures are as important as quotas and TACs. Does the Minister agree that one of the conclusions that we should draw, and that he should take to his counterparts in Europe, is the argument for regional management of the common fisheries policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly agree. A regional approach is essential to the future of the common fisheries policy and we shall be arguing in that direction in the 2002 review. In some ways, we have introduced an element of regional management with the Irish sea cod recovery programme, which is a regional management structure involving those countries with a direct interest—predominantly ourselves and the Republic of Ireland, but also France and Belgium—and the fishermen who fish in those areas. It has worked. Given the sacrifices that fishermen have made, if there is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
potential for an increase in quota, in line with the science, we should be arguing for it in Council. I shall be keeping a close eye on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cod and hake recovery programmes are an element of regional management, so that dimension is beginning to develop. Other member states are beginning to show interest in it. Some United Kingdom associations have been in communication with associations in other countries. A great deal of work has been done in that respect in Cornwall, by the Cornish fisheries organisations. It is having an effect and beginning to pay dividends. I believe that we can make progress in the forthcoming negotiations in 2002.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated 28th November 2000 from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, relating to the fixing of fishing opportunities for 2001 and certain conditions under which they may be fished; recognises that a number of fish stocks have fallen to particularly low levels; and supports the Government's intention to sustain stocks for the future, and assist recovery of those stocks which are in danger of collapse, while negotiating the best possible fishing opportunities for UK fishermen.—[	<i>Mr. Morley.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Minister has received the feedback that we have had from the industry about the relegation of the annual debate on total allowable catches and quotas from the Floor of the House to the Committee. I do not want to imply that the Committee is an inappropriate place for a debate of this nature, but it has its limitations. The Minister was right, with a view to building bridges and dealing with his public relations in good time, to state that, because of the seriousness of the situation, a full debate will be held in the new year on the Floor of the House—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hopefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I see: hopefully, there will be a debate on the Floor of the House. The Minister, I think, promised it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister said that, in discussions with the Leader of the House, he had engineered time for such a debate. However, we shall certainly keep up the pressure, because it is vital that the matter should be debated in full on the Floor of the House, and that there should be time for all those with fishing interests to make their views known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it have helped our case if other hon. Members had realised that, under Standing Orders, they could have been present for the statement and contributed to the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. These issues are often relegated to page 3 or 4 of the Whip, and, dare I say it, not many colleagues look past page 1 or 2. However, I do not think that sufficient publicity has been given to the matter. That concern ties in with the Minister's comments about the Commission's proposals being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
issued later and later every year. We are left with little opportunity to read the tomes, which are thicker this year than most, in time to make a significant contribution to the debate. I hope that, at the Council meeting later this week, the Minister will tell the Commission that that tardiness is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate can be approached at three levels. First, it can be tackled at the level of the immediate situation. No matter what the Minister says, there is a crisis in the industry, especially over the cost of fuel. He admitted that in his later contributions to the debate. We must also bear in mind the short term, which leads to the question whether the industry can survive next year, given the swingeing proposed cuts in quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the survival of the industry in the medium term. What is the future, for example, for post-December 2002? Is the CFP the answer? Is there not now an overwhelming case for its drastic and fundamental reform? Along with many others, I support the view that the over-centralised management system has been exposed as incapable of delivering a sustainable and profitable Europe-wide fishing industry. As the Minister said, last year's ICES report was the most severe for a decade, while this year it is even more severe than that. Is not that an indictment of the CFP and how it works, with its emphasis on TACs and quotas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister admitted, on their own, quotas do not work. Reducing them each year is not the answer to the problem. Each reduction seems to lead to a further reduction. We have entered a downward spiral and the way out of such difficulty is not clear. In fact, the science on which we are basing some of the proposals is not clear either. As politicians, we are entitled to say—as, indeed, many fishing industries have been saying for several years—that such proposals are all too little, too late. Action should have been taken years ago. The future is bleak for our fishing fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give him his due, the Minister accepts that TACs and quotas are not the only issues that should be considered. He referred to his support for technical measures, such as mesh sizes, fishing gear and the setting of higher minimum landing sizes. Most people would agree with his statement that "We need to think of a more sophisticated approach," but why, oh why, have we had to wait so long for management changes to come into the fray for discussion? It is accepted that there is now more fertile ground for the introduction of larger mesh sizes and square mesh panels but, for there to be an even playing field, there must be better policing and enforcement. There is little point in British fisherman signing up to the measures, as the Scots have done in the North sea, if others are not taking them on board. Without enforcement, the changes are not worth the paper that they are written on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission promised us a paper on enforcement back in 1996. Where is it? Will the Minister press for it at the meeting later this week? It would be helpful to know either today or later his views on enforcement and whether such a proposal should come forward sooner rather than later. Even
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
before the proposals for the much-reduced TACs for 2001 take effect, the fishing industry is already facing a significant crisis, half of the reason for which lies in the threefold increase in the price of fuel. That problem, allied to low catch rates, has not only put into question the economic viability of much of the United Kingdom, but is increasing the risks to our fishermen as they go out in all types of weather in their desperate search for a catch that will cover their fuel costs, let alone pay part of their mortgage. If the price of fuel does not fall significantly—there is no sign of that happening—operators will have no option other than to tie up and many of them will be forced into liquidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England, if the larger trawlers—which will be particularly hit by the fuel increases—at our major ports such as Newlyn, Brixham, Plymouth in the south-west and Lowestoft, Hull and Grimsby in the east tie up in significant numbers, that will have a considerable knock-on effect on port and transport infrastructure as well as fish processing and the ancillary industries. There is strong case to be made that, such is the state of our industry in respect of this problem alone, it is, above any of the potential effects of the reductions in quota, the issue that could make or break the United Kingdom industry, certainly in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite numerous meetings with industry leaders at various levels, the Minister and Government have been ominously silent on the matter. Other EU countries have responded positively to lobbying from their industries. Apparently, those countries that have provided short-term packages for their industries—France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Italy—have now been joined by Ireland, which has added to the already uneven playing field. It means that, once again, UK industry will be poorly placed to benefit from an upturn in opportunities, should it occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of an EU-wide aid package, which will not happen now, it is down to individual Governments to devise their own. We understand that a direct fuel subsidy is not realistic but there is word on the block—to coin a phrase—that some countries are getting away with it, contrary to EU law. It is time that someone stood up and said something about that. The Government could take measures to offset huge fuel increases that would not contravene competition law. A long list of proposals has been put to the Minister, so he will find the following points neither unfamiliar nor exhaustive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Help could be provided in relation to regulatory costs by removing or reducing payments for vessel survey charges, light dues and satellite monitoring charges. Landing charges and soft loans could also be looked at. On taxation, the Government could consider suspending class 4 national insurance contributions, temporarily suspending the share fishermen stamp and lowering the threshold for tax credits for share fishermen. Other measures could be taken in relation to levies, such as the producer organisation levy and sea fish levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Apparently, the UK's financial instrument of fisheries grant allocation is subject to an underspend of £4 million. I think that the Minister alluded to his opportunities under FIFG, which might be a useful place to start to look for financial help of the kind that I mentioned. The Government's continued inactivity on the matter gives the impression that they have no view on the future for British fishing fleets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members are aware that the ICES advice for next year is severe, but is it not true that ICES has changed the way in which it applies the criteria to a more purist approach? Has that not been compounded by the Commission's draft proposals, in which it seemed to discard its usual role of filtering advice from the Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management? Instead, it seems to have focused almost exclusively on cod and hake stocks. Some of those problems seem to have been overcome as a result of recent negotiations in Norway, during which the linkage with other species was rejected. That resulted in much smaller cuts in haddock and whiting. However, the question remains of how confident the Minister will be in carrying forward a common-sense approach in negotiations later this week. At the heart of the problem is the Commission's wish to go further than the scientific advice. One is tempted to surmise that there may be political machinations in the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is widely accepted that cod stocks, especially in the North sea, are not in a healthy state. Fishermen tell us that their catches are well down. The Minister glowed when he told us that he was right to resist last year, as he believed that they would not catch up to quota, and he was correct. The statistics on landings tell a similar story. There is general agreement that urgent remedial action is vital. However, a reduction in quota of the magnitude proposed will have an unequal and disproportionate effect on the fishing fleets involved. The situation was made more uncertain by last week's agreement—mentioned in our question time—which was pushed hard by the Commission. According to that agreement, the North sea haddock fishery will be closed if the cod quota is taken before the end of the year. Many within the industry regard that as most unwise, and as setting an unwelcome precedent. If the deal is cast in stone, will the Minister say whether it can be revisited during negotiations later this week? Perhaps more to the point, does the Minister believe that the agreement is unwelcome and against British fishing interests? Will he urge his fellow Ministers to have a rethink about this linkage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the arguments about playing our Hague preference card. Again, there was some discussion about that in question time. There is a view that we did not play the card last year so as to secure more fishing opportunities in haddock for the benefit of those with haddock quotas. The Hague preference was introduced to address the very problems that the UK industry faces by allocating higher TAC quotas to member states whose fleets are especially vulnerable. There is no question now that the extra quota will not be required next year, especially in keeping the haddock fishery open if there is no change to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
linkage proposal. The Minister did not answer clearly whether he would resist all the pressures on him to continue the linkage or would play the Hague preference card. He reserved his position, as he did last year, but, given the present situation, he will never have a better opportunity. If the quota is set too low and is reached by the year end, it will have a massive knock-on effect on haddock fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some puzzlement, not to say anger, at the Commission's CAP proposals for nethrops next year. It had been assumed that, like the other proposals, they are linked to the restrictions on cod fishing as it is believed to be an important by-catch. There has been no new advice from ACFM this year, so why is there a proposed reduction of 3,440 tonnes in the nethrops TAC? It seemed to be quite an arbitrary decision. The Minister gave some indication that he could not see the reason for it and we hope that he manages to obtain a fundamental change in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another outcome of the species linkage on which the commission seems keen is the 20 per cent. reduction proposed in the North sea for species such as dab, flounder, lemon sole, skate, turbot, brill and the rays. There is a fear that this huge reduction will run counter to earlier Commission proposals to safeguard discards and that that will lead to an increase in discards, which is contrary to the whole purpose of the conservation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the issues raised in our question time was industrial fishing, which includes a large proportion of sandeels. The proposal on the table at the moment is that the quota is rolled over in the North sea and northern waters at around 1 million tonnes annually, despite the fact that the catch of sandeels last year was just under half of that total. Why was the rollover, which is set at that huge level, not reached last year? Was it because of the market for the produce or is there a real problem, such as the Minister alluded to with regard to cod last year, and the sandeels are just not there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sandeels provide some 40 per cent. of the North sea food supply. It therefore seems of crucial importance to the fish stocks and to any programme of conservation that we look carefully at the matter. The headline on page 23 of last week's 	<i>Fishing News,</i> "Big broods slow growth", refers to the concern felt by many fishermen in the North sea that the big incoming brood of young haddock is not growing at a fast enough rate. The article quotes a Dr. Hawkins of the FRS Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen, who maintains that there is no link between slow growth rates and lack of feed. Notwithstanding the rather obvious statement that, if there is a large brood, they are in competition for the food, it seems common sense to take note of the fishermen's concerns and to investigate them. Surely, under the precautionary principle alone, we should cut back on the sandeel quota; it makes little sense to initiate a cod recovery programme with all its upheavals, and not to build into the equation consideration of all food levels. It is unfair to put the blame for collapsing fish stocks on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
overfishing, rather than adopting an all-embracing approach, including the food chain and technical measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made light of the matter of seals, which was raised earlier. He said that, if people could provide evidence that they are causing a problem, he would do something about it. There is plenty of evidence: the seal population is expanding dramatically in parts of the United Kingdom. Research on how much one seal can eat in a day would show that, if fish stocks are under pressure as they are at present—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be sensible to reduce the seal population as quotas are reduced. The Conservative party should turn its attention to the matter, as it has only one policy on domestic affairs—should burglars be allowed to shoot seals? Marvellous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to my main point, which is that, given the pressure on stocks and the problems experienced by fishermen, the matter should be looked at and a sensible programme of culling should be initiated. Why does not the Minister say positive things about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it now Conservative party policy to cull seals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Liberal policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative policy is to investigate the concerns expressed to me and to the hon. Member for St. Ives that, in some parts of the country, seals are a problem. The Minister is right to ask for the evidence; we should not ignore the problem but consider it and, if necessary, bring in a sensible culling programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: MAFF has a number of research programmes and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology is doing some work on seals, but there is no evidence about the seal population. There is also a dichotomy in some of the claims: fishermen accept that cod stocks have gone down; they also claim that seal populations have gone up. There is evidence of a population increase but, in any predator-prey relationship, if the target of the principal predator at the top of the food chain is a particular species, when that species declines, the predators decline too. There is a glaring inconsistency in the claims about seals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says, but I was not aware that seals ate only cod.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All stocks are under pressure, not just cod in the North sea, as I have been told on more than three occasions on my visits round the country. I am merely reporting back to the Minister and the Committee that it is an issue perceived to be a problem by fishermen in certain areas. All the Minister has to do is to embark on research to discover whether there is a problem and if so a culling programme will be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a hard task ahead of him this week, but he has an opportunity at least to bat for Britain as a change and to use The Hague preference to gain some ground for our hard-pressed fishermen in the North sea in respect of cod. The Minister has a good hand to play and I hope that he plays it. He will not commit himself today, as he will want to reserve his negotiating position, but there will be deep dismay within the industry if he does not have something positive to offer later this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to take the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire back to the subject of seals. He would not take an intervention from me on the subject, but the leader of the European Conservative party, Mr. Edward McMillan-Scott, visited my constituency and told local fishermen that is was indeed the Conservative party's policy to cull seals. I would like clarification on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the main purpose of our debate. I wish to reinforce a point that I tried to raise with my hon. Friend the Minister in question time. It seems appropriate to start with the North sea environmental disaster that occurred off our coastline. Trawlermen in Whitby now have to travel further to catch fewer fish, and the cost of fuel has hit them hard. For the local fishing fleet, it is not so much a double whammy as a treble or even a quadruple one. If we want a sustainable fishery in Scarborough and Whitby, we must get the boats and crews through the present environmental crisis. I ask my hon. Friend to pay strong regard to that in his discussions later this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also take the opportunity to mention the great disquiet that was expressed last weekend in my constituency when the fishermen found out that the annual fishing debate would not take place before Christmas. I shall convey to my constituents what my hon. Friend the Minister said about the advantage of timetabling a full fishery debate once the recovery plan has been mapped out in the new year. He is welcome to come and talk with my fishermen, and I hope that we shall have an opportunity to do that before the annual debate so that he will be aware of the feelings that are abroad on the quayside and out in the North sea. The temperature in the community is rising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have told my hon. Friend the Minister, in debate and personally, that the people of Scarborough and Whitby are resilient, particularly the fishing communities. They have seen the failure of a vital part of the industrial complex in the area, but they have moved on, they have made innovations and they have found other ways of making a living. One of the strong successes for the fishermen in my constituency, particularly those from the port of Whitby, has been the move to recreational fishing. I ask my hon. Friend to check his figures. My records show that the recreational fishing industry is taking only 0.8 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
of the sort of catch that the other fishing vessels in Whitby are after. Not many of them are cod; most are species that are not up for quota reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman know of a legal definition of recreational fishing? It is a defined process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; I would define recreational fishing as boats sailing out into the North sea for eight or nine hours, taking many people from the former Yorkshire coalfields who probably bring a few crates of brown ale. They put their lines out into the water, they have a wonderful day and probably return with only one or two cod.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This big?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely huge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people support the local tourism industry, and the local pubs and hotels. A small town like Whitby cannot afford to lose the more than £2 million a year that they contribute to the local economy. We must consider that point seriously, and although this aspect of the impact of the quota cuts is insignificant in terms of the wider European picture, I ask the Minister nevertheless to have proper regard for it. If fishermen cannot advertise that they are trying to catch cod with rod and line, people will not visit Whitby and fishermen will not get bookings. That will lead to further decline in a community whose fishing industry has been in a spiralling decline since the 1860s. We in Whitby cannot afford to let that happen, and it should be noted that other communities throughout the country benefit from recreational fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to develop one issue that arose during questions. Emphasis was placed on the need for regional management of fisheries, and I strongly support that in respect of the North sea. The Minister and members of the Committee will recall that, a few weeks ago, during an Adjournment debate on the fish processing industry, I mentioned a prototype organisation on the Yorkshire coast called the Yorkshire coast fishing forum. Since that debate, I have discovered that the basis of that important initiative is looking extremely suspect. The organisation was set up with support from the PESCA fund, but from April that grant will no longer be available. Will the Minister explain how we can establish a transitional arrangement, until proper regional management of our fishing stocks is established? How can we sustain organisations such as the Yorkshire coast fishing forum, so that they can act as a springboard for renegotiation of the common fishery policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Minister is dealing with that matter, will he talk to his officials about the need to enter into discussions with regional development agencies throughout the country? I am thinking of Yorkshire Forward in particular, which is the regional development agency for my constituency and that of the Minister. In terms of understanding the complexities of the Yorkshire region's fishing
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
industry, that agency has a long way to go. If funding delivery mechanisms proved to be dead ends simply because organisations such as Yorkshire Forward lacked the right expertise, that would be a tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In towns such as Scarborough and Whitby, there are 12 onshore jobs for every offshore job. My constituency contains wards with the worst socioeconomic statistics in the entire region. If we were to lose fish processing jobs, which are mainly occupied by women, the socio-economic impact on those small communities would be devastating. I know that the Minister will take account of that fact in discussions with his colleagues in Europe at the end of this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the Minister well, because I want a sustainable and growing North sea fishery that will benefit the communities who rely on this vital part of the economy not only in Scarborough and Whitby, but elsewhere in the north-east of England and Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members, I was concerned to discover that this debate had been shuffled to the Committee Corridor. I therefore telephoned the Ministry to discover whether we would have an opportunity for the important annual fishing debate to take place on the Floor of the House. The Minister said that he would seek an opportunity, through the Leader of the House, for that debate to take place early in the new year. I welcome that on behalf of Liberal Democrats and I know that the Conservative party has also made its views known. It would be disappointing and an embarrassment for the Minister if we did not secure that crucial debate. We often have the opportunity to debate the matter at this time of year, just before the final quota settlement by fishing Ministers in Europe, but we do not often have the opportunity early in the new year. If the Minister succeeds in securing that debate, we may want to repeat it in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent months, there has been concern about the draconian cuts in fish quota, particularly for cod and hake. The Newlyn fish festival in my constituency was opened at the end of August by Brian Tobin, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, who is a Liberal, of course. He was an excellent Fisheries Minister in his day and is now a member of the national Government in Ottawa. He presided over closure of the grand banks in 1992 and his speech to the Newlyn annual fish festival included some uncomfortable truths for fishermen and politicians, including the fact that fish cannot be caught if they are not there. Judging by the Minister's replies to our earlier questions, he is taking the right approach. It is important to act according to the science and not simply to make fishermen suffer because of collateral damage to some of the associated species. The message from the collapse of the cod fishery off the grand banks of Canada during the early 1990s is worth remembering at this crucial stage in terms of the future of the European and particularly the United Kingdom fishing industry. Taking a robust approach and, if necessary, introducing significant cuts in the quota for species facing collapse are of primary importance.

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
The fishing industry does not often feature in the headlines of national newspapers, but it has done so recently. There have been unseemly xenophobic skirmishes in the newspapers about who is entitled to fish and the headline writers have had a field day with headlines such as, "Cod has had its chips." The serious basic point is that difficult decisions must be taken in the face of worrying scientific evidence which has emerged recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to have taken on board the comments made about the management of stock and the potential collateral damage from a significant cut in cod quotas—for example, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and the blunderbuss approach when a surgical strike is required. The Commission's proposed cuts are a little like throwing an unselective bomb into the issue. We need a less one-dimensional and a more sophisticated approach than that proposed by Europe. The Minister has been reassuring on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) suggested, there may be an argument for increasing the saithe quota in the North sea because of saithe depredation of sandeels. On nephrops, the Minister said that the situation was worth reviewing and challenging. The case for invoking The Hague preference was mentioned, so I shall not labour that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leader of the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation has said that the 60 per cent. cut in the south-west's cod quota, the 38 per cent. cut in its megrim quota and the 74 per cent. cut in its hake quota—on top of the fuel crisis—could mean
	<br><blockquote><p>the end of the Cornish fleet as we know it.</p></blockquote>
It has been suggested in the past that the industry has cried wolf, but it now faces such a serious and fundamental crisis that I fear that some of the gloom and doom interpretations of its future prospects could turn out to be accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our good wishes will be with the Minister at the end of the week in trying to ensure a decent, scientifically robust settlement that takes into account the need to address the industry's problems by implementing sophisticated technical measures rather than the blunderbuss approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed cut in the hake quota is especially galling for Cornish fishermen, as they have been pushing for more than 10 years for measures to protect small hake from capture before they are able to breed. For the past 13 years, scientists have consistently said that the capture of juvenile and undersized hake should be tackled, and Cornish fishermen are now asking why that was not done, because the situation has reached crisis point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission's proposal of a 74 per cent. cut in the hake quota means that every fisherman will suffer, irrespective of the type of gear that he uses. For example, Cornish gill-netters use a large mesh to catch larger fish. On average, each fish is 50 cm to 60 cm long, is five to six years old, weighs 3 kg and is worth £10. By comparison, other continental trawlers, who are able to use smaller mesh for gill nets, target much smaller juvenile hake of 27 cm. As each fish is
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
smaller, up to 200 times more fish are killed to make the same amount of money. For several years, Ministers and scientists have been aware that at least 8 million undersized hake are discarded dead each year. That is destroying the fish stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in respect of the 38 per cent. cut in the megrim quota, it is clear that many juveniles are being caught and discarded, especially in the otter trawl fisheries on the continental shelf. That problem could be addressed in several ways—for example, by creating a no-take zone in that area, by increasing minimum landing sizes or by introducing new minimum mesh sizes. Similar issues apply to monkfish, where it is not clear what is happening to the stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will understand that the proposed 60 per cent. cut in the cod fishery in the western approaches is not welcomed. According to the industry, there is no truth in scientists' claims that cod is a significant by-catch of gill-netters who target hake. Landing declarations of UK gill-netters show that average yearly landings of cod amount to a by-catch of less than 2 per cent. Perhaps most significantly, in the late summer of this year catches of juvenile fish on the wolf grounds were the best since 1994, when small cod and haddock were prolific. This year, the haddock are back and so are the cod. The industry believes that the introduction of 100 mm mesh for trawlers targeting those species has protected cod and haddock from excessive effort. Next year, even greater landings will be seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also bear it in mind that, although any cut in the quota will be keenly felt by our fishermen because of the UK's poor share of the total available catch, it will be relatively unnoticed by the French, who have a large proportion of the catch in area VII.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is xenophobic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests from a sedentary position that I am taking a xenophobic line, but the relative stability tenets worked very much against Cornish fishermen. The mathematical fact is that the impact of a substantial cut in the cod quota will be significantly greater for Cornish fisherman than for their French counterparts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have commented on the French proposals to introduce a new regime for deep sea fisheries. Some have suggested that the proposals are opportunistic and cynical, and should be blocked, but deep sea fisheries should be protected. We should take this issue seriously, although not in the manner that the French propose. At the moment, their record catch would give them an unprecedentedly high proportion of future deep sea stocks. There is a similar broad consensus on industrial fishing, and I hope that the Minister will remember that in his meeting at the end of this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I wish the Minister well in his negotiations. His responses have established a sound basis for his approach, and I hope that he will live up to the expectation of a full opportunity to debate this issue early next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not join the chorus of critics who complained that this debate has not taken place on the Floor of the House. Under your benign chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien, this has been a very successful debate. It has provided a useful opportunity to put questions directly to the Minister, and to listen to and test his responses. This is a good formula—better, in many ways, than the formula that was used when the Conservatives were in power. We used to tell the Minister concerned to fight for a particular issue when negotiating in Brussels, and he would go away and say, "I'm fighting for Britain." There would be no debate on his return, because other interests of particular importance to Conservatives would take precedence, and fishing would once again be betrayed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we get several bites of the cherry. We are putting our questions to the Minister and testing his responses, with the prospect of a debate when things have moved further on. That is a good way of doing it. It is also good because, in many respects, the only advantage of having a debate on the Floor of the House is publicity. It gets into the newspapers, but that just means that the parties take unrealistic stands, as in the debate on the presidency conclusions on the Floor of the House this afternoon. I mention that in passing, because those are the conclusions of a meeting held on 7, 8 and 9 December, but they were written and transmitted from the British representative in Brussels on 8 December. In Europe they write the conclusions before the meeting, which is a sensible way of doing things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats will probably want to defend those European standards, but a debate on the Floor of the House leads to people taking unrealistic stands. The Conservative Front-Bench team would be saying that they would have got a better deal and supported field subsidies for the Government. There would have been the usual abject grovelling sycophancy from the Liberal Democrats, "My Europe, right or wrong," whereas here, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), actually ventured a criticism of France, which took unusual courage. Because it has taken place in Committee, under your skilful chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien, it has been an effective and interesting debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend, in his capacity as chairman of the all-party fisheries group, would suggest that all members write to the Leader of the House and not only advocate a debate in the new year, but say that this is the better format in which to take on board our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be useful to use this format again when my hon. Friend the Minister comes back. It stands to reason that we must have a debate on the Floor of the House. However, this debate has been so
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
successful that it is well worth repeating that format. My hon. Friend should be congratulated on agreeing to present the case in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little worried by the response of my hon. Friend the Minister on The Hague preference, because that was sanctioned by the 1983 stability agreement. It is a means of safeguarding the position of the British industry. It gives us a guaranteed tonnage if the TAC falls below a certain limit. Grimsby does not qualify. Logically, it should be included in north Britain, but we are not included in that definition for some reason—probably as a result of an obscure European prejudice, or perhaps geographical ignorance on the part of Commissioners drawing up the areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefit of an increased guaranteed tonnage for the UK in the affected quotas is that it could be distributed throughout the British industry, so that, although Grimsby would not benefit directly, it would benefit indirectly. I was worried when my hon. Friend the Minister said that he would look at the matter in the light of the negotiations, because asserting The Hague preference would be unpopular among his European colleagues. He would not make himself loved. The fear of a row should not be the reason for not introducing it when necessary, and it is necessary at this juncture, particularly because of the link between cod and haddock in the EU-Norway agreement. If we catch the much reduced cod quota—we did not last year; the Minister is absolutely right about that, but this year the quota is reduced—then haddock stops too. That would be disastrous, although we must bear it in mind. It is a way of helping the British industry and asserting ourselves—something I like to see in the negotiations and something that the Minister will, I hope, consider very seriously indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was enormously cheered by his comments on industrial fishing, which must be stopped. It is impossible to justify to our fishermen—and to our electors—carrying on the massive industrial fishing effort, grinding everything into fishmeal, including fish good for human consumption, thus devastating their stocks. That must be stopped. A total ban is the only approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that British representatives in Brussels will fight the link that the Commission has created between cod, hake and the other stock. It means that, when there is a reduction in cod, there must be an automatic reduction in other TACs. That makes no sense at all. There is different scientific advice on different quotas, and the prevailing circumstances are different. If the Commission's decisions, justified for cod on scientific advice, cannot be justified for other species on the same advice, we should mistrust them. Indeed, such decisions would fly in the face of scientific advice. I am not sure why the Commission introduced the link—possibly to show itself as effective and vigorous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an extremely strong case. There is no logic to the Commission's proposals. We have all, including previous Governments, said that we depend on advice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
from scientists, but the Commission appears to be ignoring such advice. Does the hon. Gentleman think that there is a hidden agenda?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not tempt me down that path. I always think that there is a hidden agenda. In terms of the Commission, there almost certainly is one, but discussing it would divert me from the main thread of my argument—which is to go out and have a fish dinner as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at an important stage in the life of the fishing industry, which is so vital to our constituents, as it is to our country, our national diet and everything else. We must confront the crisis. The shock of the decline in stocks and the threat to cod has brought the industry and the public up against the conservation problem. We have come up against it not when the cavalry is on the horizon, but when there are prospects of change and a more rational approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cod and hake recovery plan must be developed into a recovery plan for the whole North sea. The Ministry is devising a plan for fishing based on the recommendations of the Select Committee on Agriculture, which reported 18 months ago. We need a national scheme for the rejuvenation of fishing and a recovery plan for areas that are especially threatened. If a plan were successfully developed for the North sea and enforced by regional co-operation and all the technical measures possible on mesh sizes, closing of grounds, and especially on spawning grounds, it could lead on to an overall recovery plan, which is what we need. We need a recovery plan for species and areas, and a national plan for fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fishing has rightly been a paranoid industry—it has been persecuted, or certainly not helped as it should have been. Fishermen are beginning to realise that they need to work together and plan in the face of the conservation problem. Now comes the problem of their survival in future. They are aware of and accept the necessary measures, are conversant with the conservation problem and are prepared to go along with the sort of measures that will produce the needed recovery plan. However, it is important that the mood change at this juncture, so that the industry is helped over the hump to inherit the future that lies ahead. It would be disastrous if, for want of Government support because of the financial crisis at MAFF, and for want of European support as well, the fishing industry in this country shrunk, began decommissioning and sold its quotas so that more quota-hoppers came in. The beneficiaries of such a decline in the British fishing industry would be my friends the French, the Dutch and the Spaniards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should help the British industry by seizing the mood that is now emerging, and use the pressures of the crisis to alleviate that mood. We should hold out hope to people in the industry, and show them that the prospect is there and that the Government will work with them to grasp it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall call only two more speakers, so that the Minister has time to wind up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Great Grimsby rightly said that the debate had been successful. However, he made the mistake of believing that he had been promised a sequel on the floor of the House. The Minister, with his usual cunning, appeared to suggest that, before slightly backing off from the idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been successful, but it was not held here for that reason. I acquit the Minister of responsibility for what has happened, but the debate was held here today simply because the Government have mismanaged their timetable. They filleted the House of Lords—to use a topical phrase—in the belief that it would then become nice, kind and tractable. Finding that that did not work and that they had got themselves into a mess, they realised that they had to go through some show of holding a scrutiny debate on this matter. "That's OK," they thought, "We can put it on in European Standing Committee A and we will have done the absolute bare minimum." That is what lies behind the debate—the question of priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have found the time for, and given priority to, a fully contested Bill on fox hunting. The fox is not an endangered species, but they will devote lots of time to a completely fruitless debate on the matter. In this Committee, we are dealing with two endangered species: fish and fishermen. The Government decided that the matter could be put before a European Standing Committee, and that that would be sufficient scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend see any contradiction in the Government's declared intention to push through a Bill that will save the lives of a few thousand foxes, because to kill them by hunting them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not debating fox hunting. Can we stick to the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Let us compare the hunting of foxes to the wanton destruction every day of the week of thousands of tonnes of fish discarded dead into the sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right. This is all about priorities, and it says something about the Government's priorities that the debate took place in this way. I hope that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby is successful in his negotiations with the Leader of the House, and that in due course there will be a full-scale debate on the Floor of the House. The hon. Gentleman is right when he talks about publicity. Yes, in a sense, what have we lost? All the old favourites—to use that term widely—are, I hear, having that debate today. However, the House of Commons should hold this debate on the Floor of the House. It is that important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have been beguiled into a false sense of reassurance by the fact that, on this occasion, no one attacked him particularly. The Minister has been lucky—the Commission has done him a favour by taking a position that is so extreme and absolutely barking that he can pose as the great champion of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
fishing industry without having to address the fact that the policy within which he works is wholly unsustainable. He came here today fearlessly pledging—I am not being sarcastic—that he would go to Europe and demand that scientific advice be adhered to. Well, I would hope so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go through all the species again because time is short. The Commission is overturning the advice on various species given by scientists who, in the opinion of west country fishermen, already take a fairly rigorous view of the matter. That Commission decision has particular relevance to the west country. The Minister says fearlessly that he will go to Europe—but I know what will happen. He will come back in due course and say, to coin a phrase, "Fish in our time." He will say that he has insisted that the scientific evidence be adhered to, and if he can secure a debate on the Floor of the House, or, more to the point, if he cannot avoid it, he will try to claim credit for the fact that the policy is intact and scientific advice has been adhered to. What we should have been talking about today—on the Floor of the House—is the policy itself. The common fisheries policy is hopelessly flawed. That explains the speeches of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. On the one hand, he wants to be a party loyalist. He still believes that it is a slight possibility that one day he will be made a parliamentary private secretary to someone, but on the other hand, he is absolutely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always hope. On the other hand, he is absolutely itching to get stuck into the CFP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been discussing the conservation of species today as though the common fisheries policy were designed as a conservation measure. It was never designed as a conservation measure. Every time quotas are imposed under the CFP, are fish in some way safer? Of course not. Fish do not know about the policy. Fish swim into the nets regardless of whether they are within the quota. Every time we decrease the quotas, we do not save the life of one solitary fish. All we do is produce the abomination whereby many millions of dead fish are hurled back into the sea. That is the common fisheries policy. My own party should have realised that many years ago, and now it has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to have heard from the Minister a recognition that the CFP cannot continue. If anyone coming out of the cold and sitting in the Strangers Gallery wanted to know what aspect of the CFP shows how wrong and rotten it is, we would have to come back over and over again to the baby fish, as they are sometimes called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is cunning and beguiling. He commits himself to doing everything and giving all possible assistance, short of actual help, with regard to baby fish. He tries to imply—within the present policy he has no choice—that the problem of baby fish is very difficult, that we must tackle it, and that baby fish should not be part of the discard. However, that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
quite deliberate. Minimum sizes are set because some of our European partners want to catch baby fish, and with several species can do so legally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the common fisheries policy as presently constituted, and within any CFP remotely like it, the problem will never be solved. It will never be tackled while a lot of Ministers from disparate countries sit around the table at the Fisheries Council and say, "Over the years we have pillaged our own waters, but at least we still have the British waters to pillage." While a CFP is based on that policy, it will never be possible to solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Year after year, until the past two to three years, we have heard the nonsense of the Minister responsible, be he Conservative or be he Labour, threatening Armageddon and being criticised by the Opposition. He then returns with slightly less than Armageddon, and proclaims it as a triumph. That is the nonsense of the CFP. Species come close to extermination, and fishermen are likely to go out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one way of dealing with the problem, and it is this: we need a policy whereby this country controls its own waters. Why would that work? Because if we were to control our own waters, we could quickly introduce the necessary measures relating to netting to catch specific species. There would be no horse-trading about fish. There would be no question—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment, as I am always anxious, for electoral purposes, to let him say as much as possible about fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we set our own policy, we would have an incentive to get it right, and if we were in that position, others would assert their own control, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that it is Conservative party policy to re-establish national control over UK fishing waters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where the hon. Gentleman has been for the past two years—the west country or the Houses of Parliament. I shall tell him what he clearly does not know, although everyone else does. We have made it absolutely clear that when we are returned to government we shall insist on return of control, and we shall do so with all the firmness that we showed when we said that we wanted our original budget rebate. That was given to us not by concession but because we made it clear that that was what we were going to demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister will have to do—but, frankly, he is almost too honest, and certainly too intelligent, to try—is to show why there is a possibility of radical reform within the CFP. It will be a happy Christmas for him, because all he has had to do today is discuss a ludicrous situation. However, when he has found that the scientific advice has been adhered to—as I am sure that he will—he will still find that the CFP is about dumping dead fish in the sea, and that conservation has not been advanced by one jot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply to the debate will be important. It will enable us to know exactly what message he is taking away from the Committee. I shall be brief and, to that end, I shall pass the briefing of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation to him after our proceedings, in case he has not seen it, to avoid my having to read certain details into the record. We have benefited from hearing the statement. It should be exported to the Floor of House to ensure that the background details of our debate are known. The pressure is on the hon. Gentleman to succeed in persuading the Leader of the House to hold a fuller debate in the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the hon. Members for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) and for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) are no longer in Committee, but in the debate on the Queen's Speech the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central talked about seeing a glass half full rather than half empty. Perhaps that might have affected him, because he took away from our debate on the fish processing industry and our meetings with the Minister a feeling of optimism about the industry. The telephone calls that I have received from fish processors in the north-east of Scotland have highlighted optimism about the future being stable, but I do not detect that in the short term. While I do not want to talk down an industry, it is important that Treasury Ministers recognise the serious and immediate crisis facing the fishing industry. Whatever comes out of the negotiations will be extremely important. Whatever the results, the problems facing that industry will have to be addressed before the debate early in the new year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One message that I have received from fishermen is that fish do not know national boundaries, and thus the solution to the problem must concern the fishing zone—the North sea as a whole. Drawing artificial lines on the map and saying, "We'll have one rule here and another rule there," is not the best way to save fishing stock. A key measure is zonal management; it must come into force. Square mesh was dealt with in the statement.

In response to the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), the Minister said that he was not sure where he stood on decommissioning. If it is recognised that we must have a certain amount of catching power versus a certain amount of sustainable fishing stock, we must somehow reach that balance. It seems that the industry's case for decommissioning is strong, and it feels that it is a victim of the Fontainbleu agreement. I point again to the Treasury. In the good years, it was banking its money under the agreement from both agriculture and fishing. These are the bad years. If we were another country in the European Union and were not affected by the agreement, there would be much more incentive to put the money back. The message is that if we get cheap insurance with a big no-claims discount, when it comes to making a claim we have to stump up that no-claims discount. The Minister must go back to the Treasury and say, "That is the position, and you, the Treasury, must recognise it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I shall finish with some technical details. The Minister accepted that the Commission has gone overboard on nephrops, monkfish and herring, and said that he would consider the position. We shall see how he succeeds. As for the predators, the argument about the saithe seems strong. I do not want to create too much confusion about seals, but let us consider any balanced ecology where man has interfered. Man has taken away the killer whales that were predators on the seals. The seal population has grown. We must constantly be looking at such matters and recognise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Seals can be killed at the moment, but in an area such as Aberdeen where the mouth of the river is in the city, the police will not look kindly on people with rifles shooting in the river mouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister recognises the seriousness of the industrial fishing problem, and he now has to convince his colleagues of it. Unless we get long-term, sustainable balance in the fishing stock, we will not have an industry for the future. I repeat the message that there is optimism for the future, because fishing has the capacity to be sustainable. That is still to be achieved: the Treasury must recognise the seriousness of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of time constraints, I shall be brief. I, too, welcome the Minister's assurance that he will use his best offices to secure a full debate in the new year. I go further than some right hon. and hon. Members in saying that if he does not do so, it will be a worrying demonstration of the importance that the Government attach to the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My views on fisheries policy are well known to the Minister. We have crossed swords in many previous debates. My view remains that the common fisheries policy is a practical and environmental disaster. I share the belief of my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) that fisheries policy must be repatriated. I have never changed my view on that: I have expressed it for as long as I can remember and there is increasing evidence that it is the only way in which to proceed. Control of our own fisheries waters must be returned to our Westminster Parliament. We are making no progress in the collective at Brussels. This afternoon we have mentioned technical and other measures that have simply not materialised after so many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make three points. First, I want to illustrate the effects of quota cuts, which have failed to address the fundamental problem. They will increase the discards—of that I have no doubt. Even the Minister accepts that there is a risk—shorthand for agreeing with me. The quota will impact drastically on the economies of fishing countries, on jobs in the fishing industry and on the viability of fishing communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eight years ago, the Commission concluded that quotas were not working satisfactorily as a conservation measure. However, we all know that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Commission's answer to every problem is more of the same appalling medicine—quota cuts or additional regulations. All we ever get is tinkering with the existing mechanism and no fundamental reform. As my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge said, fundamental reform is impossible to achieve within the collective: it takes only one country to veto it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is extremely serious; I would like to address it to all Members of Parliament. It is a shame that we are not conducting the debate on the Floor of House, where more Members could consider the morality of the policy. How much longer can we go on supporting a policy, year after year, when we all know from evidence—some of it photographic—that thousands of tonnes of perfectly fresh saleable fish are being dumped back into the sea every day of the week? That is an outrageous affront to ecology and the environment. Many Government Members are supposedly concerned about animal rights and cruelty to animals, yet the most obvious aspect that everyone knows should be dealt with is the one that they choose to ignore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my third and final point. The responsibility for this appalling policy rests with Members of this House. It is not the Commission, the European Parliament or the Commissioners who are responsible; we voted for these measures and we are responsible for them. I should like to have had the opportunity to say that in the House. It will not be on my conscience when we continue with a policy that is exterminating entire species offish. I have consistently voted against the common fisheries policy and I shall continue to do so on every occasion. I ask right hon. and hon. Members to search their consciences and ask whether they can go on supporting this appalling policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer the points raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, my hon. Friends the Members for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) and for Great Grimsby, and the hon. Members for St. Ives, for Teignbridge, for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) and for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many points have been made about the format of our debate. It will be beneficial if we have the full-scale debate on the Floor of the House as a follow-on. We are talking about the detailed aspects of the forthcoming Fisheries Council on TACs and quotas. Perhaps I am putting my neck on the block by arguing for a format in which I receive an hour of grilling from well informed hon. Members. I can see the advantage of a format such as this in principle, followed by a debate in January or February. The matter is not in my power, but in that of business managers. I have undertaken to speak to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, as the case for a full-scale debate is entirely justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
I reassure hon. Members about the link between the cod quota and other quotas, especially haddock. That link would generally be managed by individual producer organisations, which would make matching stocks to effort a little easier. MAFF data on catches show that we can distinguish between cod and haddock fisheries, so there are areas of sea with predominant cod or predominant haddock. A fishermen told me that there is anecdotal evidence that cod, being a cold water species, have retreated northwards into deeper water and that there may be a concentration of cod stocks in the deeper water of the north North sea. We can identify where the fisheries are, which makes effort control easier. It also makes it easier to argue about the Commission's proposal for a blanket effort reduction across all stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A perfectly reasonable point was made—I think by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire—about TACs for dab, flounder, skate and rays. It is predominantly a by-catch fishery, but the uptake in the United Kingdom was well below the TAC, or that proposed by the Commission with a 20 per cent. cut. I do not feel greatly concerned about that stock; I think that we can manage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions were asked about restructuring and adjustment of the UK fleet. Given the pressures on the fleet, it is inevitable that we shall have to consider it. I have said that I am willing to talk about it with the industry in the new year. Some funds are available through FIFG. If we go for a decommissioning scheme, we shall need considerable extra funds, which will mean making a case on behalf of the industry—and I have told the industry that I shall do so if need be. I am worried about decommissioning, because it has knock-on effects that cannot be ignored. It has benefits, too. In the most recent decommissioning round, some of the money went into modernisation of the fleet, but I am sensitive to the fact that it has consequences on individual ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decommissioning is a cost commitment. I gently say to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that if one promises tax cuts and cuts in budgets, one cannot promise additional expenditure elsewhere. I notice that there were no promises of figures from the Conservative party about decommissioning and restructuring or support packages. The balancing of resources has to be borne in mind. I am prepared to make the case, but one has to do so in an overall Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the issue of enforcement, although progress in common European standards has been made. The UK was a big driver in that, incidentally. We believe that we are making progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned seals, so I repeat that the issue is one of evidence. I have studied in detail the Canadian research about the effect of seal predation on the cod fishery on the grand banks. The Canadian Government started that research to prove that seals were a factor; it was not independent research. However, they could not prove that seals were responsible. Although cod stocks went down and have not recovered, the seals are healthy because they eat a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
range of species, including some predators of commercial stocks. The issue is complicated, and we should not allow seals to be used as a scapegoat, as often happens. I am not clear about the Opposition's policy. It seems that they have moved from executing burglars to executing seals. Neither policy is without risks, as we shall see in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives mentioned undersized hake and megrim, and I freely concede that that is an issue. The introduction of the 100 mm meshes has been helpful, although there was resistance from some people, even in the industry. However, those meshes are the right way forward and the solution to the problem of juvenile discards. The hon. Member for Ludlow feels strongly about the issue, but in his enthusiasm he sometimes forgets that the bulk of discards of juvenile and unmarketable fish occur as a consequence of normal fishing patterns. We must address all discards, whether they occur as a consequence of quota policy or fishing methods, and I am more than willing to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby apologised for not being able to be present at the end of the debate. He supports a change in format and mentioned the Hague preference. Implementation of the Hague preference is a complicated issue and not automatic. It requires the support of the Commission and other member states. From a minority position, the UK and the Republic of Ireland would be trying to push through a policy that essentially took fish from other member states and gave them to us. It is not easy to take such a position, but our right to do so was established in the common fisheries policy and I intend to use it where appropriate. I will certainly consider it carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned industrial fishing, and I have made our position clear. The Danes are decommissioning some of their industrial fishing vessels, and there is a strong argument for reducing the amount of sandeel stocks, but I suspect that we shall not resolve the argument at the forthcoming Fisheries Council. The debate is on-going, but must be addressed. Although it may take time to effect changes, I assure the Committee that I am committed to doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Teignbridge mentioned west country stocks and the fact that the Commission has gone beyond science. It is a question of effort. I absolutely accept that quotas are a blunt management issue, but they are not a feature of the CFP. We have used quota management before as a member of the CFP. Other fishing countries use quotas as part of their
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
fisheries management. They are an established part of such management, not an invention of the CFP, but that does not mean that there are no problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only two minutes, so I shall finish my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Teignbridge mentioned national control. We cannot turn back the clock, although people can argue that decisions taken in the past were not in this country's best interests. The idea of establishing national control needs to be further explained. Which vessels will be excluded from our waters and what will be the consequences for our fishermen fishing in non-UK waters? How will that be achieved if fishermen do not agree? It was rightly said that that issue was one of treaty change, which would require abolition of the veto. The Conservative party is not keen on doing that, and people should not make false promises to the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council will be difficult. Hon. Members who have spoken agree on the issues on which we need to concentrate. I shall certainly try to address those issues and obtain the best deal for our industry. I shall also try to keep an eye on sustainability, sound science and the long-term future and viability of the UK fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
