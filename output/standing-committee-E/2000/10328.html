	<section>
	<div class='title'>Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the quorum for Standing Committee C is three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Scrutiny Committee for seeking this debate. We welcome the opportunity to describe our approach on the directives and to answer any questions that members of the Committee may have. We shall certainly take the Committee's views into account during future discussions and negotiations, but I hope that at the end of the debate it will feel able to agree to the motion that seeks support for the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fully support the environmental objectives of the two directives, which I hope will be uncontentious. The proposal on waste from electrical and electronic equipment aims to protect the environment through the prevention of waste by increasing the recycling and recovery of WEEE and improving the environmental performance of all operators. The proposal on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment aims to ensure the harmonisation of legislation controlling hazardous substances in such equipment. The second aim is to limit the environmental impact of electrical and electronic equipment when it reaches the end of its life, through the minimisation of the use of hazardous substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that a growing number of European Union member states are taking unilateral action in these areas making it increasingly important for a level playing field to be created by taking action through European legislation. It is important that the aims of the proposals are in line with the United Kingdom's own policies and goals set out in the national waste strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite our support for the directives' objectives, we have many concerns about the texts. As the Scrutiny Committee noted, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds the proposals, which we may discuss later in the debate. Our concerns centre on what is practical for the UK and what we can do to maximise the environmental benefits without compromising our competitiveness or damaging small businesses. As the Minister with responsibility for small businesses, I stress that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as is practical, we want a WEEE directive that is clear about what it is setting out to do and how it intends to do it. Lack of clarity will make the proposals difficult to implement and enforce. We fully support the environmental goals of the proposals, but it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
essential that any targets proposed are achievable within the time constraints set out and, furthermore, are easily measurable. The latest council working text is helpful in that respect. A switch to basing the recovery and recycling targets on the average weight of appliances, rather than on each appliance, would allow under-achievement on one product to be compensated for by over-achievement on different class of products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also seek maximum flexibility for some provisions such as the producer responsibility financing requirements in the WEEE directive, so that member states can implement them in the most suitable manner. For the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances directive, we want to ensure that all applications in which a substitute is not available or substitution is not practical are accounted for and granted appropriate derogations. On competitiveness issues, we are particularly concerned about the potential impact of the WEEE directive on small businesses, and we have been working with the Small Business Service and in working groups to seek to minimise those effects. We have established a small business panel to help us get a better handle on the impact of the proposals on small producers and retailers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot guarantee that all our concerns will be dealt with in the final versions of the two proposals, but we are making progress in working group negotiations and have secured support for derogations that will be helpful to small retailers. The implementation timetable is approaching something that we think is achievable. If we can secure support for complete exemptions for the smallest businesses, the overall cost and regulatory burden would fall considerably without undermining the environmental advantages to be gained from the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scrutiny Committee suggested that a proposal on hazardous waste diminished the need for the WEEE directive. I want to make it clear that that is not the case; we see the two directives as complementary, and it will take many years for the volumes of hazardous substances now entering the waste stream to be reduced. Many of the products have 15-year lifespans, and the hazardous substances directive bans will not begin until 2008. Therefore, many years—in some cases, a couple of decades—will pass before the hazardous substances directive has a real impact at the end of the life of those products. It is clear that we also need the treatment requirements of the WEEE directive. That will be the major route to reducing the environmental impact of hazardous waste in existing electrical and electronic equipment for at least the next 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my opening remarks will be helpful to the Committee. I look forward to questions and to our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that their questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There should be plenty of opportunities to put questions to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Amess. This is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the uncertainties and the huge cost implications arising from the two directives—the costs amount to between £1 billion and £1.5 billion a year, according to some estimates—why did the Minister in her letter of 7 December seek parliamentary clearance before the Environment Council meeting of 18 and 19 December?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment, who represents the Government at the Environment Council where the directives are negotiated, believed, on advice from our ambassador at the European Commission, that it would be helpful to the debate that was likely to occur at the Environment Council if the directives had already received parliamentary scrutiny. My right hon. Friend understood, as did I, that the Committee would be happy with that. We believed at the time that considerable pressure would be exerted by the presidency to agree a common position at the Environment Council meeting. In the event, that did not happen; the Committee felt that it would be inappropriate to give scrutiny before it had had a chance properly to go through the papers in detail and hold the debate. The issue was not of any importance, but that was the context in which we made that request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne Mcintosh	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my welcome to you in the Chair, Mr. Amess. The Minister said that in the long term, the overall cost of regulation would fall. I presume that that is what she meant. What is her Department's prediction of the initial cost of implementing the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have prepared initial regulatory impact assessments on both proposed directives, of which the Committee has copies. We shall revise those regulatory impact assessments as we get more information from industry about the likely costs and as the directives change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The preliminary estimate is that the total costs resulting from the WEEE directive could be as high as £560 million a year, plus £6 million to £7 million in one-off costs for information provision. We estimate that the hazardous substances directive will cost about £290 million a year before 2008, when the ban comes into effect. Obviously, however, we shall try to implement the directives in a manner that will cause as little financial burden to fall on industry as possible. As I said, we are requesting an exemption for the smallest producers and retailers, which would substantially reduce those costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the existing cost estimates. A substantial part of the £560 million is an estimate provided by retailers, through the British Retail Consortium, relating to the impact on retailers of the retail take-back provisions. Some key members of the British Retail Consortium have said that they are building a cost model to allow them and their fellow members to get a much better handle on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
precise costs. At the moment we have rather broad brush estimates that are based, for example, on the square footage believed to be required to store the material and how much it will cost to rent. They are trying—we support them in that effort—to get a much better fix on the costs, but we are also trying through negotiation, and especially through the small firms exemption, to reduce whatever the costs turn out to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you, Mr. Amess. My question relates to articles 4 and 7 and separate collection and financing. In some areas, local and waste authorities might cover some of that collection, but in the longer term article 7 places the burden on the producer. If public sector collection is to continue, that might indirectly subsidise particular manufacturers in some countries. The directive has a competitive element that does not seem to have been worked through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that important point. The notion of producer responsibility has wide support, and it is clearly right that producers, not necessarily individually but perhaps collectively, should pay for the treatment of such waste collected from private households. We are trying to provide as much flexibility in the directive as possible, so that in considering the costs of collection, which involves the local authority point, as we approach implementation we shall be able to establish the fairest allocation and sharing of the costs involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was flummoxed by the Minister's response to my earlier question. Given the huge uncertainties that remain about the directives, it is astonishing that she should try to bypass parliamentary scrutiny of the directives at this stage. I hope that the civil service will not advise Ministers to do so in future. I find it extremely reprehensible. We are dealing with a significant set of directives that will add hugely to business costs, and the Committee is one of only two opportunities that the House will have to debate the issues involved in any detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the hon. Lady appearing before the Committee today when it is the Minister for the Environment who is negotiating the directive for the Government? Parliament needs to be able to question the Minister who did the deed, not another Minister. That is important, because the suspicion is that one Minister faces Europe to negotiate the matter in Europe, and another Minister, with a friendly, pro-business face in Britain, debates the issue in Committee. Why can we not question the Minister who is involved in the negotiations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is simple. I am the Minister, and the Department of Trade and Industry is the Department, with policy responsibility in the United Kingdom Government for such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position in the Government. We decide for the United Kingdom who has policy responsibility on different issues, and policy responsibility for such matters lies with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Department of Trade and Industry. As I am the DTI Minister responsible for the environment, I have that responsibility. At the European level, it is for the Council to decide which Council of Ministers deals with which directive. In this case, it is the Environment Council, which my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment attends. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that there is a difference of opinion between my right hon. Friend and myself, or that we say different things to different audiences, is simply rubbish. We take exactly the same view on the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government support the goals of the directives, although we have worries about the details. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and I had a helpful discussion about the directives with the regulatory impact panel, which was chaired by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office. There was no disagreement between the Minister for the Environment and me, or between the regulatory impact panel and us. We agreed the negotiating position that the UK Government should adopt and, especially, the desirability of securing an exemption for small retailers and producers, which would greatly reduce the costs to business of implementing the directives. That was supported equally by the Minister for the Environment and me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the concept that the producer should pay for the cost of damage, but I am concerned about the impact of historic waste. A burden could be imposed on producers and retailers that would arise from historic factors. In some cases, the historic factors could be such a burden that they could put businesses in severe difficulty. Would it be a way forward to treat historic waste differently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that one must adopt a different approach to historic waste. We are examining the matter, which was also raised in the context of the vehicle life directive. In the context of this directive, most people will agree that historic electrical and electronic equipment waste can be sensibly covered only by a collective approach. Some companies that produced such products up to 15 years ago no longer exist. Other companies have experienced such a dramatic change in market share that basing an individual financing approach on current market share could be devastating for individual producers. In other cases, it may be the other way round—if one took the original market share and imposed it now, it would be devastating for the company. It is easier to say that there must be a collective producer responsibility for historic waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is less clear-cut for new products. An individual producer responsibility for new products would strengthen the incentive for producers of new products to ensure that they build the reduction—and ideally elimination—of waste at the end of products' life cycle into the design and manufacturing process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Mcintosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's answer to my initial question, will she accept that the disadvantages and cost to producers and manufacturers outweigh any advantages that may flow from the directives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that point. Following an initial assessment of the directives, it is clear to the Government that there are real gains to be made from sensibly drafted and implemented directives about such a matter. To a large extent, this is a matter of common sense. All consumers can see the extraordinary build up of electronic and electrical gadgetry in our homes and lives, particularly if we have children. We all acquire more televisions, video recorders, mobile telephones and other such items. There is a real issue in relation to personal computers, the product life cycle of which is shrinking and the replacement cycle of which is speeding up quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens to such equipment when the consumer no longer wants it or when it no longer works? It is essential that we put in place an effective framework that will incentivise producers to design and manufacture those products in such a way that, when they stop working or are no longer wanted, most if not all of the components and material can be recycled, or the entire product can be re-used. If we do not do that, we will build up the most appalling problem for ourselves—more and more material, much of which is bulky and heavy, and some of which contains hazardous substances, will end up going to landfill. We do not want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for putting the framework in place at a European level, not simply a national one, is that to which I referred in my opening remarks—the single market aspect. It is undesirable for different member states to impose different requirements. Producers would then have to make products to different standards for different markets. Alternatively, the country that is the most demanding would, effectively, impose its requirements on the rest of the single market. It is much better to ensure, within the framework of the single market, that there is a level playing field for the production and, ultimately, disposal of such products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under paragraph 1 of article 4, member states should ensure that the provision is enforced within 18 months. Does my hon. Friend feel that that is too tight a timetable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend. We want the collection requirements to commence at the same time as producer responsibility, but we would prefer that to be 30 months, rather than 18 months, after the adoption of the directive. We are continuing to discuss that with our colleagues in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the Minister's last-but-one answer, this is only a single market issue if one goes down the absurd route of forcing companies, whether through domestic law in the Netherlands or elsewhere, to take on the responsibility, rather than finding another solution, to which I shall refer later. What is the Minister's assessment, given that she is happy for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the directives to be accepted by Parliament now, of the additional cost that will be passed on to the consumer? For example, how much extra will a typical fridge cost as a result of the directives? Will she insist that the extra cost is separately itemised on the invoice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, I have not seen any well-founded estimates of the additional costs to consumers. There were suggestions in an article in 	<i>Sunday Business</i> last weekend of an enormous increase in costs to consumers. I do not know where those suggestions came from, but they seem to have no basis whatever in fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline the point that I was making about small retailers and producers. About 70 per cent, of the total number of firms producing electrical and electronic equipment employ fewer than 10 people. They, in turn, are responsible for only about 5 per cent. of the total turnover of the sector. Therefore, if we can obtain an exemption for manufacturers employing fewer than 10 people, we can exempt the great majority of firms from the impact of the directive without affecting the achievement of the environmental goals, because those small firms are responsible for such a small amount of the output. There is an equivalent situation in relation to retailers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is to make sure that the discipline that we have imposed on ourselves in the United Kingdom is introduced into the cost-benefit analysis of proposed regulations at European level. One can only make an effective judgment about costs versus benefits and about whether the proposals should be amended—for example, with the small firms exemption—after a rigorous and disciplined regulatory impact assessment has been undertaken. Having made a judgment about costs versus benefits, one can then consider where the costs will fall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scrutiny Committee's report refers to the Commission having addressed the relative costs of the proposals and estimates the collection costs of re-use and recycling for households at between 500 million and 900 million euro a year. Will my hon. Friend tell the Committee what will be the United Kingdom's share of those estimated costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may have caught me out on that. The figures that I quoted earlier are United Kingdom figures from our own regulatory impact assessment of the costs that would fall on manufacturers, collectors and others in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that the basis for the directive lies in the fifth framework directive. I had the good fortune to visit Brussels on Monday and Tuesday of this week as part of the annual visit of the European Scrutiny Committee, following the visit last year of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs. We followed up several items under the fifth framework programme and the emphasis that the Commission placed on that programme was deemed not to have
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
been a success. One of the reasons for that is reflected in, for example, the European ground water directive, now coming up for review.

Does the Minister therefore not have some sympathy with the request from the European Scrutiny Committee that there is no urgency for the proposal to go ahead? Would she, or whichever Minister is to negotiate on the Government's behalf, not be minded to argue in the Council of Ministers that the proposal would be better placed within the sixth framework directive, given that the targets will be much tighter and there will be much greater scope for us to reach those targets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes an interesting point, and I shall certainly reflect on that. It relates to the hazardous substances directive, which has a foundation within the environmental provisions of European law. The electrical and electronic waste directive is grounded in single market law, and we want to keep it there, as we have done successfully so far. The waste directive predates the sixth framework programme and I am not sure how much sympathy there would be for the hon. Lady's proposal, particularly since not only is the Commission strongly committed to proceeding with both directives, but so are all other 14 member states. The proposal, although interesting, would not gain any sympathy from other member states. We would be better advised to continue our present negotiating strategy, which reflects our commitment to the directives' goals, but seeks to achieve them in a more sensible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further to the earlier question of my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill), I referred only to United Kingdom costs. However, we regard the Commission's estimates of the costs throughout the European Union as being far too low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right. The hon. Member for Upminster raised a good point about the disparity between the so-called regulatory impact assessments prepared by the European Union and the more rigorous, but still less than adequate, regulatory impact assessments prepared in this country. In response to my question about how much that would add to the cost of a typical fridge or washing machine, the hon. Lady said that she had seen no well-founded estimates and said, "I do not know". What right does she have to come before the Committee, proposing such wide-ranging directives, without having an answer to that fundamental question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not mislead the Committee and pluck figures out of the air. The two directives proposed by the European Commission enjoy widespread support. In the United Kingdom, as in other parts of Europe, the directives' goals are supported by manufacturers, retailers and the Government. However, we are not satisfied with the drafting of the directives, or with their analysis of costs and benefits, about which we are seeking more detailed information. There are equivalent requirements in Japan, which has a high-cost and high-price retail economy, and the evidence suggests that the cost is about £25 per fridge. It is difficult to draw accurate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
comparisons, and we believe that the cost will be lower in the UK, but it is not yet possible to produce detailed estimates for each of the items covered by the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Scrutiny Committee's first report states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is identified in the Community's Fifth Environmental Action Programme as one of the target areas for prevention, recovery and safe disposal".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister will agree that, regrettably, the Commission occasionally gets things wrong. For instance, with regard to the current foot and mouth crisis, a high-ranking Commission official, whom I have known for about 20 years, admitted to me that he was unaware that the EU ground directive was preventing infected animals from being buried. Therefore, if we are to impose a substantial cost on producers, would it not be preferable to have the legal base and the remit of the directive in place at the beginning, rather than return to the matter in three or four years, after having penalised producers in the UK, who are facing increasing global competition, especially from third world countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The WEEE issue was identified in the fifth directive, so it predates the fifth framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is strong support throughout the EU for tackling the issue of hazardous substances that are used in the manufacture of many products. Unless action is taken, those substances will continue to enter the waste stream for many years. The proposed hazardous substances directive is intended to be implemented in 2008, which allows adequate time for producers to adapt their processes, change the design of their products and, in some cases, invest in new plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fast-growing consumer market for electrical and electronic goods throughout the EU. We should neither deny that that creates problems, nor delay addressing them. There is support for the directives from retailers, as well as from environmental groups and the Governments of member states, because they acknowledge that problems exist and that they must be swiftly and sensibly tackled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the draft regulatory assessments in relation to the options in paragraph 3.3, reference is made to the fact that the financial cost
	<br><blockquote><p>"will predominantly fall upon manufacturers, importers and distributors".</p></blockquote>
The document goes on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Depending on the implementation option, some costs may fall on Local Authorities".</p></blockquote>
What studies have been undertaken in respect of the likely additional costs to local authorities? What would be the impact of relaxing burdens on local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can give my hon. Friend the detail that he requires on local authority costs. As I said earlier, we will want to consider how best to implement the measures and how the costs of collection should be shared among the various parties
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
after we have finalised and agreed the directive. That is the same sort of issue that we have to consider in relation to the end of vehicle life directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that in Japan such measures add about £25 to the price of fridges. That will alarm Lee Refrigeration, a major employer in Bognor Regis, which is already fighting tight margins in a fiercely competitive market and says that demand is inelastic. That is a major hike in the price of domestic goods for consumers in this country. Will reference be made to that in the Labour party manifesto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we might enjoy one of those intelligent and useful discussions that we so often have in this Standing Committee, without resorting to such cheap party political points. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not go around the country saying that the price of fridges will rise tomorrow by £25, or say that to Lee Refrigeration in his constituency, because it would not be true. As I have said, we are quite clear that any additional costs to consumers will be significantly lower than they are in Japan, which is a high retail price country. We also seek the support of the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues to make significant changes to the directive that will substantially reduce the costs compared with the original regulation impact assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell the Committee what stage the process has reached? I think that she said that she hoped that a common position would be reached at the March Council. However, I understand that in December the European Parliament had not even considered the matter, so I should be surprised if it managed to consider it quickly enough to reach that common position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I referred to the common position I was talking about our expectation before Christmas that a common position would be arrived at with urgency at the December Council of Environment Ministers. As for the European Parliament, its Industry Committee voted on its amendments on 27 February, and the Environment Committee will presumably vote on its amendments on 24 April. The plenary session, during which the final vote on the European Parliament amendments is expected to take place, is scheduled for 15 to 16 May, so the earliest time at which a common position could be adopted is June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question whether the issue would be included in the Labour party manifesto was not a party political point but a constitutional point. The Government propose to add £25 per the cost of every fridge in this country. It may be less, but the Minister did not give us another figure; the only figure that she has given the Committee is £25. If she can give us another figure, will she do so? If the matter is not mentioned in the manifesto, how can people who object to a measure that will create such a hike in the price of consumer white goods do so constitutionally? What can they do to stop it happening in our democracy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Will the Minister also tell us what she means when she says that the retail and manufacturing sectors of this country support the goals of the directives? Does she mean that they support the environmental goals that deal with waste electrical and electronic equipment, or that they support the proposals that retailers and manufacturers will be forced to take back these goods?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I mean is that those sectors support the goals of the directive. They understand that there are environmental problems in relation to hazardous substances and waste, and they want to help in taking action to deal with those problems. Neither the Government nor the Commission are suggesting a consumer responsibility principle. We are suggesting that producers, not consumers, should pay. It will be up to producers to decide how they deal with the resulting costs. There is a long lead time before the hazardous substances directive comes into effect. Production processes, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, are changing and improving all the time. As companies invest in better plant, processes and design, and better skills for their work force, they can increase productivity and reduce the cost at which they produce goods, so there will not necessarily be any additional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman takes an extremely crude and simplistic view of how manufacturers deal with rising standards. Manufacturers have the greatest incentive to improve the quality of their goods and productivity—to produce better goods at lower cost. The principle within the directive is one of producer responsibility, for which there is wide support. However, the actual costs depend not only on the final wording of the directive, but on the volumes of goods manufactured and all the other aspects of the production process to which I have referred. It is a pity if the hon. Gentleman allows his and his party's rather wild anti-European feelings to contaminate his views on the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot possibly comment on my hon. Friend's views but they seem reasonable and sound to me. The Minister must be aware that the reason for the debate is that the European Scrutiny Committee requested an opportunity for the proposals to be considered in depth, and it was not convinced of the Minister's explanation as to why the lifting of the scrutiny reserve was necessary. In view of the rather relaxed timetable that she set out before the Committee this morning, in which there is no prospect of the earliest common position being reached or even discussed before June, does she not agree that it is therefore inappropriate to rush the proposals through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to rush them through. I am seeking support for the sensible position adopted by the Government towards the directives, which seems to be the proper thing to do. I explained the circumstances in which my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and I thought that it would be helpful and not problematical to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Committee to lift the scrutiny reserve before Christmas. The Scrutiny Committee rejected that request, perfectly rightly. As it turned out, no common position was arrived at at the December Council and we are now negotiating in the Council working group. We await the view of the European Parliament and, as I said in my opening statement, we welcome this scrutiny debate this morning. We can take the Committee's views into account as we continue our discussions in the Council of Ministers and the working group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that the Minister can tell the Committee with a straight face that she believes that the hazardous substances directive will lead to a reduction in the price of refrigerators. Has the hon. Lady visited a fridge manufacturer? If not, would she like to visit Lee Refrigeration in Bognor Regis to discuss the directive? Could she define contaminated goods within the terms of the directive, because there is no requirement to take back the goods if they are contaminated? Does a deep fat fryer covered in fat qualify as contaminated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used the term "contaminate" to refer to the effect of anti-Europeanism on the hon. Gentleman's views of the directive. He raises a serious point about the extremely old and unpleasant fat-coated electrical fryer. One of the issues on which we are concentrating in the working group discussions is the problem of the range of domestic electrical equipment that might be caught by the directive, to reach a rather more sensible definition of the sort of domestic electrical and electronic goods that we want to be taken back, especially by retailers. Contaminated goods are those that present a biological hazard or might be radioactive. Even under the existing proposals, retailers would be entirely within their rights to refuse to take those back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Retailers, in particular small independent retailers, but also some chains, have genuine anxieties about how to handle the practical implementation of take-back—how to find the room to store the material before it is taken away for treatment and how to train staff and deal with the health and safety issues that may arise. We are discussing the matter in some detail with the British Retail Consortium to ensure that we reflect those anxieties in our discussions with the Commission and the Council of Ministers and that they are resolved in the drafting of the directive as well as in the practical implementation that will follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My anxiety relates to people such as elderly or disabled people having to return goods such as cookers and heavy fridges and perhaps having to pay for such collections. How will a procedure be put in place to help such people return goods to retailers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for providing not only an interesting question but a new face in the debate. In the case of large white goods, on the collection of which the UK has a pretty good record, many retailers already make arrangements when delivering a new product to take away the old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
We want to encourage that practice and see it increase. That will be the answer not only for many elderly people. When I last replaced a cooker, I could not have carried it out of the house, let alone anywhere else. It makes sense, as those are the sort of goods that would typically be replaced, for the take-back to occur at the same time as the delivery of the replacement good. In other cases, it may be a question of considering the facilities that local authorities already provide. My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster referred to the role of local authorities. Existing mechanisms are in place not only for collection but in some cases for separation and treatment of such waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following that logic, how would a local authority or the Government recover the cost of removing a fridge of Japanese origin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many local authorities already charge. The approach will vary from council to council, but many local authorities will provide a service to their residents for the collection of especially heavy waste and will charge for it. How they would recover the cost in the case of a fridge, for example, of foreign origin, is a matter that we shall need to consider as we discuss with manufacturers how the costs of producer responsibility should be shared. We shall consider the matter as we approach implementation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from my hon. Friend's excellent question, how would an internet company fit in with the arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the issues that we are currently discussing with the European Council and Commission to establish where responsibility should fall and whether it should fall on the internet retailer or at some other point in the value and supply chain. The matter has not yet been resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the Minister's answer to my previous question, does she share my anxiety that her proposals and the agreement that she wants to give to the EU directives, in particular the one on waste disposal and WEEE, will hit domestic producers unfairly and will have a negative and greater cost impact on domestic and European producers than on their Japanese and other competitors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in my opening statement, competitiveness is one of the issues about which we are concerned. However, it is a mistake to assume that, when the European Union or an individual country puts in place high environmental or product quality standards, that is necessarily damaging to competitiveness. What we have seen in industrialised countries generally, and in Scandinavian countries especially, is the advantage that can be gained by producers when Governments set high environmental standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those standards, in turn, incentivise or require manufacturers to design cleaner products and cleaner processes for the manufacture of those products. That, in turn, enables them to have a head start in moving into other markets as consumer expectations and environmental standards rise in those other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
It also gives manufacturers a particular incentive to ensure that their investment programmes give them higher productivity and lower costs in other parts of the production process, in order to compensate, if necessary, for higher costs arising from higher environmental standards. The assumption that underlies the hon. Lady's question is not correct. Requirements to take back and to treat waste that arises will fall on retailers, and, collectively, on producers. That will apply to waste that arises in this country or in other parts of the European Union, regardless of where the product was originally manufactured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assumption behind my hon. Friend's question is, in fact, absolutely right. I invite the Minister to visit Lee Refrigeration in Bognor Regis, which is one of the only remaining major domestic fridge manufacturers in this country. She would learn a huge amount if she were to discuss these issues with that company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that there are still many issues to be discussed with the European Union, so I find it astonishing that she did not want to debate the issue in Parliament. Ample scope exists for a further debate on these issues once they have been resolved in Parliament. As I understand it, she is seeking two key derogations—one for small businesses and a second on the range of products to be incorporated within the directives. How much support is she achieving for either of those derogations, especially that for small business? Which other member states are supporting her in that endeavour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue has not yet come back to the Council of Ministers. It is being pursued in the Council working group, and helpful discussions have taken place, especially on the issue of the timetable. Certainly, there are people in other member states who understand the problems of small retailers and small manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a strong argument to make on the matter. However, that underlines the importance of the retailers and producers operating not simply at a national level but at a European one. Collectively, throughout Europe, they are making the same arguments to the European Commission. In other member states, they are making those arguments at a national level, to Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have advanced the general argument about the need for more effective business representation, especially small business representation, at a European level. In other member states, we have argued the case vigorously with our business organisations. I am happy to tell the Committee that there is evidence of a change of heart on the part of other member states. However, Council discussions are confidential, and I am certainly not going to start naming other member states at this stage. That is a matter for those member states, especially while we are still in discussions on the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The target for introducing the restriction of hazardous materials, on which we have concentrated this morning, is 1 January 2008. What
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
expectations does the trade have of being able to achieve that, and how easy will it be to substitute other materials for those that will be restricted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the producers' concern is not so much the target date, but the substances for which there are no practical substitutes, such as lead used for soldering processes. We are seeking a derogation for lead because there is not a practical substitute for it. That is only one example of such a case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed to the debate, will the Minister clear up some confusion? She said that retailers would have to pick up the cost, but I am not sure whether she meant the cost to the producer and, therefore, that the Japanese and third country manufactures would make a contribution at that stage. However, she went on to say that the cost of removing a particular article, such as a fridge or deep freezer, would be borne by the consumer, so it appears that the consumer will be given a double hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned, as are constituents, that despite the Japanese saying that they expect the unit cost of a fridge to increase by £25 because of considerations of waste disposal and good waste care, the Minister does not think that there will be a unit cost increase to UK manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister disingenuously accused my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) of making political capital from the matter. We cannot be responsible for methods that the tabloids will use when arriving at what they believe the cost of a fridge will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I made it clear that the underlying principle of the directives is producer responsibility. As in the end of vehicle life directive, we need to discuss how costs should be assessed and where they should fall. In my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster, I said that it will probably be appropriate to treat historic waste differently from waste that arises from new products. That is primarily a matter that arises from the WEEE directive, but it is a matter of producer responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 3(b) of the RoHS directive and the definition article of the WEEE directive defines a producer as a person
	<br><blockquote><p>"who imports that equipment on a professional basis into a Member State."</p></blockquote>
What is the US Government's opinion about the directives? Do the directives conform to World Trade Organisation rules, and will the Minister assure the Committee that they will not be the cause of yet another dispute between the EU and the USA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the directives conform to the World Trade Organisation rules, so there is no reason to believe that they will give rise to another trade war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will manufacturers who go out of business after one or two years bear their fair share of the costs incurred by the directives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that there is a real issue about producers that go out of business. We will consider the issue of collective responsibility for historic waste. However, the matter underlines the complementary nature of the two directives. The hazardous substances directive will reduce the problem in future years and decades because less problematic material will be used to make new products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will be the Government's response in the Council if they fail to obtain the support of other member states for the derogations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's attitude towards our colleagues in the European Union since the election is in striking contrast to the Conservative Government's attitude during their 18 years in office, so we are confident that we shall attain our goals. Reasoned argument with our colleagues and Commission officials generally achieves good results for not only the United Kingdom, but the European Union as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain her next course of action. How can she have a view about what happens in the Council of Ministers? If its discussions are confidential, how does she know about them? She is not a member of the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Council of Ministers comprises Ministers of all member states. To ensure that the interests of the United Kingdom are properly represented, my right hon.

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 10802/00, draft directives on waste electrical and electronic equipment and on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment; notes the Government's current negotiating line on the Document; and supports the Government's actions.—[	<i>Ms Hewitt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

They involve huge expense to consumers, a huge change in the law and in the way in which business must structure itself. I re-read the Labour party's manifesto before Committee and there was no mention of such a policy; nor was there reference to it in any of the four Queen's Speeches. I have not received one letter from a constituent suggesting such a change, let alone any letters demanding one. I had not been lobbied as a Department of Trade and Industry Opposition Front-Bench spokesman on the issue until yesterday, when I was approached by those who are against the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the points that have just been made and given that the whole process started in 1991, what was the view of the Conservative party and the hon. Gentleman on the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from talking about the Labour party manifesto, I have assiduously eschewed making party political points. The reason why I referred to it is because we live in a democracy and proposals are put before the country in manifestos; minor proposals can be missed out because they would expand manifestos into three volumes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about a minor proposal today. It is important. It will cost industry billions of pounds and will add about £20 to the cost of consumer goods. We should not get into a "You did this. You did that" argument. I am making an important constitutional point. We are being forced to adopt the directives through qualified majority voting. I suspect that many hon. Members of all parties are worried that such laws are being made month-in, month-out, piling huge burdens on to business, and that there is nothing that we can do as a democracy to stop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tend to agree with the hon. Gentleman's point. However, if he were really serious, surely his party's manifesto in 1997 would have contained a proposal objecting to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that the regulations have been placed before Parliament. What is most worrying about proposals from the European Union is that the whole process is murky. It is almost as though that is deliberate, so that people do not know about them. After today, however, people will know about the proposals and I hope that they will be subjected to much wider public discussion before they become law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When he was reading the Labour party manifesto, did he see the section on the environment and on the need to improve recycling levels?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. Landfill is important, but there are other ways in which to deal with the matter. To force companies to take back their product at the end of the lives of those products is not the way to deal with the problem.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that it was. The Minister is a conscientious politician who wishes to work for the national interest and, although she has fielded questions robustly, I detect from her demeanour that
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
she, like me, is depressed about the directives. That is also apparent in her epistle to the European Scrutiny Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am frequently lobbied, both as a constituency Member of Parliament and as a member of the Opposition trade and industry team, about the increase in regulatory burdens. The Minister is also concerned with that, as it is one of her ministerial responsibilities. Recently, she wrote to me about the matter. She stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My role as a Minister for Regulatory Reform is to ensure that new regulations are not introduced unless they are absolutely necessary and impose the least cost to business. To this end, the Government has considerably strengthened its systems of regulatory control."</p></blockquote>
I mentioned that the disposal of old electrical equipment is a problem. Recently, I dumped an old fridge at the Wandsworth tip. It was a free service, but I wondered what would happen to my fridge and to hundreds of thousands of others. However, the directive's proposals are not the correct response to the issue. The principle of subsidiarity should be applied to it: Great Britain should decide how to tackle the problem. It would become a single market issue only if end-of-life cost and burdens were imposed through the law on manufacturers, which would be a catastrophic route to follow. To create a fair single market, it would be necessary to harmonise that throughout Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the UK trades throughout Europe, would it not affect our businesses if other countries imposed such burdens on manufacturers? Therefore, if a manufacturer or country decided to follow that route, it would be a single market issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each nation should have the right to take such a decision. If a country did so, its standard of living would fall. If a Government decided to tinker with their value added tax system to encourage consumers to buy recyclable products, that would cause the country's standard of living to fall due to lower revenue from VAT receipts. Every country should be entitled to take a decision that would make their manufacturers more inefficient than ours. That should not automatically be a single market matter—nor should differing rates of corporation tax—although the hon. Gentleman has argued that it should be. Competition among member states is a good way of keeping burdens to a minimum, especially corporation tax burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been proposed that manufacturers should be forced to take back their products at the end of their useful lives because that would encourage them to design recyclable component parts. That is a clever notion. However, such a market response could be triggered in a less burdensome and bureaucratic way by ensuring that alternative ends for such products reflected their true cost. It astonishes me that landfill sites are economic, given that building land in west Sussex costs over £1 million an acre. The market will always respond if it receives the correct, gentle signals. Major retailers already offer to remove customers' old washing machines or fridges to encourage them to purchase new products. It is troublesome to have to hire a van to take an old fridge to the Wandsworth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
dump, as I have recently discovered. I would much prefer to buy such a product from a retailer who offered to take away my old machine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Market responses are always preferable to the heavy hand of the law and the Government machine. The market will find the cheapest and most efficient ways of responding, which rarely cause unforeseen consequences. Waste is a difficult issue because, if free municipal tips did not exist, irresponsible people would dump their refuse in a quiet country lane at night rather than pay a fee to a contractor. We have already recognised that problem, which is why we have a free refuse collection service and why we have municipal dumps paid for from local taxes. We can find a domestic solution to the problem by combining what the local authority does with the waste with incentives for consumers to buy equipment with which it is easier for the local authority to deal. I have suggested lower VAT rates during this debate. Anything would be better than this complete and utter mess, which will undoubtedly become as unworkable as the waste packaging directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just described the current situation and told us that, in his experience, it is not working—that he had to take a fridge to the dump and does not know what will happen to it. How can he argue that that state of affairs will change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not argue that there was no problem. There is a problem, and it came to my attention a few weeks ago as a result of taking a fridge to the dump. I am saying that we should be having a debate in Britain about how to respond to this problem domestically. For example, we could respond by having differential VAT rates. That is just one idea, off the top of my head. If we debate the issues as a nation, we will come up with many other ways to encourage people. We should provide a market signal that they should be buying products with more recyclable components.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am saying not that there is no problem, but that we should find domestic and market-oriented solutions to the problem. Otherwise, this scheme simply will not work. I guarantee that the waste from electrical and electronic equipment—WEEE—directive, if implemented in the UK, will not work, just as the packaging directive has become an unworkable nightmare. Under the packaging directive, the manufacturer of a component for, say, a tractor is responsible for the packaging used for that component, even when its purchaser has taken it to the other end of the country for use on a farm. The manufacturer remains technically responsible for that packaging, so no one obeys the directive. People are finding ways around it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in passing laws to deal with problems if those laws are absurd and unworkable. That is precisely what the WEEE directive is, with the added problem that it will cost industry billions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
pounds a year. The Minister appears to share that view. She made it clear in her explanatory memorandum that the directive may be
	<br><blockquote><p>"difficult to implement in practice, since the directive applies to such a wide range of goods."</p></blockquote>
The memorandum goes on to state that the directive is
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely to impose significant further burdens on business, and the likely costs and benefits have not been fully assessed."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In addition, the Government is assessing the desirability of specific provisions, including those on treatment and recovery, to ensure that the requirements are appropriate for all types of products and represent the best practical environmental option."</p></blockquote>
That is also the view of industry, despite what the Minister said. The Industry Council for Electronic Equipment Recycling—ICER—is a cross-industry group that deals with waste electronic equipment issues. It is drawn from materials suppliers, producers, retailers, recyclers and the waste industry. It is very critical of these directives and states that some of the targets—the recovery and recycling and re-use targets—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are unattainable, e.g. 70 per cent, recycling target for equipment containing cathode ray tubes (CRTs) when there is no accepted recycling process for CRTs. Others may be technically attainable … But the costs of achieving this marginal increase in recycling/re-use will be disproportionate to the environmental benefit."</p></blockquote>
The retail industry is alarmed by the directive. The scope of the proposals remains ambitious, covering a multitude of appliances from small toys to household items. The industry feels that the initial scope should be restricted to large domestic appliances. I acknowledge that the Minister is seeking to achieve that, but she has not yet succeeded in doing so. I hope that, if she is not successful, she will stop the measure coming before Parliament. She has said that it should not apply to small appliances or to small businesses. If she fails to secure those exemptions, I hope that she will not bring the statutory instrument before the House—if she is returned at the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Retailers have serious concerns about the requirements in the directive for collection points within retail space. Many issues make that proposal impractical, not least those relating to health and safety. Disposing of a fat-infested 10-year-old deep fat fryer or a fridge of which the door may be infested with pathogens has huge health and safety implications. All sorts of issues must be tackled as a consequence of these directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the scope of the proposals, the recovery targets are ambitious. UK processing facilities are currently limited and, in some cases, non-existent, as with cathode ray tubes. That echoes the point that was made by the ICER.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that no provision has been made for producers that entered and left the market before their products reached the end of their lives. The Minister acknowledges that she is trying to deal with that issue, but she may fail. What will she do if she fails to ensure that the European Community addresses the measures? Will she still bring them before the House and expect a compliant majority to vote them through?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The costs are staggering. The Federation of Electronic Industries said
	<br><blockquote><p>"We, and other sectors of Industry, are greatly concerned that the proposed Directive has the potential to damage severely a strategically important sector of European industry … The financial impact of the measures on the UK will be enormous: running costs for the take-back schemes and meeting recycling targets could be 1.25 billion Euro/year; new investment-technological changes for phasing out certain substances, redesign, establishing take-back, providing information to customers and recyclers could be 2.5 billion Euro/year; and 6.5 billion Euro to deal with historical waste".</p></blockquote>
Those figures are staggering. A euro, depending on circumstances, is about 66p or 62p. When one converts the figures to pounds, one sees that they are very large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulatory impact assessment gives similar figures, so the industry is not simply making wild guesses. On the restriction of hazardous substances directive, the assessment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Industry estimates that the one-off policy cost to firms of this Directive could be as much as £1.2 billion (annualised to a policy cost of £290 million p.a. up to 2008)".</p></blockquote>
The Minister quoted that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A host of issues need to be tackled. What about the economic and environmental impact of using alternative substances to those banned? The Minister referred to lead solder. If that were to be replaced by other substances, more electrical charge might be used to get through a less conductive metal. That has CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> effects of people making separate, deliberate journeys to take back their old toasters or personal computers? Evidence and research by PC World shows that, if people offer to take back an old PC when they buy a new one, they come back with it on a separate trip because they want to transfer all their files from the hard disc of one to the other. Such issues must be assessed. The Minister has said that more assessment needs to be undertaken of the environmental impact of alternative substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the WEEE directive, the regulatory impact assessment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Industry estimates that the costs of distributor takeback may be high. One preliminary estimate is that the cost of retailer takeback could be as high as £500 million per annum".</p></blockquote>
That is £0.5 billion of extra costs per annum from one directive and £300 million extra from the other, so the total is £800 million. That is eight times the administrative cost of the working families tax credit, about which industry is now squealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great respect for the Minister, despite her left-wing pedigree. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Her former left-wing pedigree. She will remember a parliamentary question that I tabled about 18 months ago, in which I asked her to list all the regulations that applied to a refrigerator manufacturer who employed 1,000 people. Her first attempt at a response was to refer me to the website of the Department of Trade and Industry. I telephoned the parliamentary unit at the DTI to complain about that, as I do not see why a Department cannot simply tell me what regulations have been passed by the House. I presume that the regulations were proposed by the DTI, so there should not be a problem, and I think that the Minister would probably agree. I was informed that the DTI would try to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The DTI lawyers worked on the problem and asked if I could wait a week, which was fine. They then asked if I could re-table my parliamentary question, which of course I did. I waited weeks and was eventually given the names of three regulations that applied specifically to fridges. There was no mention of all the other employment and company law, and health and safety and environmental rules and regulations that would also apply to the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister wanted her Department to give a full reply. Why should she not? It would not be any skin off her nose, as there is nothing to hide. The truth is that the Department could not give a full reply because my question was too difficult to answer. This Government of all Governments expect a full reply to be given to such questions by every manufacturer in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached saturation point with regulations. As a minimum, we need a regulatory moratorium of several years to let industry catch up. Ideally, we should start reducing the level of regulation, but so much is done by qualified majority voting. It would help if the Government were to vote against the measure. I hope that hon. Members who really care about what is going on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way; I want to finish. I hope that hon. Members who care about what is going on will put party politics aside—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is a serious point. I hope that hon. Members will try to tackle what is becoming a hugely serious problem, more serious even than landfill sites. I speak of the intolerable burden of rules that is crippling industry, suffocating innovation and enterprise and damping down enthusiasm for business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer first to the matter of party politics raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). I intended to approach the subject in a non-party political manner and I was surprised by his contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked the Minister for a list of regulations. If I were in the Minister's shoes, I would be tempted to send him "Halsbury's Statutes" and one or two other legal tomes. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was making a party political point with an unreasonable question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it was unreasonable. The Department of Trade and Industry has a team of well-qualified lawyers and experienced civil servants. With those resources, such a question should not be difficult. Someone setting up as a fridge manufacturer with 1,000 employees is expected to have the answer to all those questions. Expensive City lawyers have to be employed to find the answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a serious point, and I expected a quick but full response. I raised the question not as a party political point against the Minister but as a point against Administrations generally, whether Conservative or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Labour. I suspect that the answers given by the last Tory Government would be the same as the Minister's. I made a genuine point about how we administer ourselves and we must tackle it urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I have debated the impact of regulations before. One company's regulations are another person's protection. A balance needs to be struck. Regulations specific to fridge manufacturers will be fairly limited. The other regulations apply to any industry and most companies will be affected by them. The point was a little unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the principle of what we and the European Commission are trying to achieve in shifting the balance of responsibility to the producer. I believe that it was a principle of the Conservative party, even if it has changed since. The Minister was right to mention that the country is engaged in a broad debate on the subject. Consumers and the population at large believe that we should try to attack those problems. That is certainly evident among younger people. Those hon. Members who visit schools will know that, at every question and answer session, we are asked what we are going to do about the environment. Constituents who write to me on environmental issues often complain that we are not doing enough. I can understand that. The problem is getting the right balance. Debates such as this need to concentrate on that balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal started in 1991. The broad principle must have been approved by the previous Government, or it would not have got this far. I believe that qualified majority voting on the subject was not applicable at the time. In other words, it would not have been a QMV subject in 1991, so it would have been possible for them to stop it in its tracks. I suspect that they had to acknowledge, as I do, that something needed to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to raise that subject with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, but he would not give way. Will my hon. Friend confirm that it was the Conservatives who extended qualified majority voting? Not only did they accept the principle of producer liability, they made sure that we had to deal with it under the current arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who, as usual, has a handle on the detail. He is absolutely right and if the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton were consistent, he would have acknowledged that in his contribution. If he were a Government Member, the relevant proposal would have been introduced because there is a general view in society that we should be doing something about the environment. Looking at the list of hazardous materials that will be restricted, I know that there will be concern in my constituency, where we have several landfill sites. What we put into those sites is a major issue. Unless we do something about it, we will damage
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the planet for our children and our children's children. The question is whether the proposals strike the right balance, and I have some concerns about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time allowed for introducing the proposals—18 months—is tight. I know that the Minister said that we were trying to extend the time to 30 months. We should do whatever we can to extend the period, although obviously not indefinitely, so that small, medium and larger businesses can cope with the proposals. There will be knock-on effects in the high street, for example. Smaller retailers, such as the electrical shop in the high street in my constituency, where space is very limited, may be under a particular burden. Such retailers will need time to work collectively with local authorities and others to make the necessary arrangements for storage and collection. Disproportionate cost burdens may fall on such businesses if we do not get the exemptions right, although larger businesses may have sufficient resources. We already have a problem trying to retain high street trade, which must compete with the big retail centres. I would not say that high street traders were now in their coffin, but the proposals could represent another adverse impact. We must bear that in mind when considering the effect of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the possible impact on local authorities. I have been raising the issue of the burdens on local authorities for some time because we tend to concentrate on the burdens on industry. We hear of central Government—this is a criticism of the previous Government, as well as this Government—putting burdens on local authorities without properly funding them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the regulations are to work, we need the active co-operation of local authorities in partnership with local retailers and chambers of commerce. Unless we provide adequate funding—it might be necessary for industry to participate in some way, and some of the documents point towards collective funds—further burdens will be placed on local authorities, many of which are already stretched, and they will not be able to implement the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There needs to be a cultural change, something that we tend to ignore. Many people go to the shops and buy their electrical goods without thinking about the old ones that the new ones replace. We need a culture change, whenever possible taking our toaster, or whatever, with us when we go to buy another one. There may need to be a lead-in time while best practice in take-back is disseminated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the hon. Gentleman highlighted the absurdity of the whole directive: that we should take our toaster with us when we shop? It is utter nonsense to say that people will take their food mixer or rice cooker with them. That is just not going to happen, is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not happen overnight, but it may happen. Personally, if there were a facility in the area to take replaced goods, I would be tempted to take them along. That is the cultural point that I was making. When I dispose of my rubbish, I take the bottles to the local receptacle; I did not do that a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
couple of years ago. More and more people are thinking that way, certainly in my local authority—so much so that the containers at the local tip tend to be insufficient. That means that demand exists. Constituents have complained to me that local authorities should be doing more to meet it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A cultural change is building up about recycling and the best thing to do with waste; people are conscious of the problem. I am not sure that the current proposals give sufficient impetus to that. If the Minister touches on that point when she winds up the debate, that will be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear it in mind that the proposals would certainly have an effect on small business—larger industries would be able to build them into their costs. However, we must also bear it in mind that the average cost of fridges and other electrical goods has tended to fall in real terms. Although there is a competitive element, the margins are sufficient to make the proposals possible. It would be right for people to consider the impact of the regulations when they design and produce materials. The market would acknowledge that and make the necessary changes to its planning. I give the proposals a cautious welcome, but we have a lot more work to do. I agree with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that we need a much wider debate in Parliament and outside, because the proposals would have an impact, but I think that they would be broadly welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne McIntosh	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are asked to take note of the European document containing the two directives, to note the Government's current negotiating line and to support the Government's actions, which I have difficulty in doing. I note with horror that I have here a Government pen here that says "Your Britain Your Europe", which the Minister may want to have back as I am not entirely at one with her proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Minister a word of caution in case the House ever comes to consider a statutory instrument about the proposals. She will remember the toy safety directive in 1992, introduced under the Conservative Administration, which sounded innocuous, said good things about toy safety and covered new EU manufactured toys and imported toys. In its enthusiasm, the Department—I do not know if any of the Minister's advisers recall this—added a condition: the sale of second-hand toys to charity shops was to be abolished. That led to a flood of correspondence for me as a Member of the European Parliament, and we coined the phrase gold plating of directives. I hope that the Minister will quash any attempt to gold plate these two directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that the Committee has had the opportunity to consider the proposals in greater depth. After our discussion, the Minister must be aware what extra burdens will be placed on producers. I am sure that her Department can advise her on the lengthy proposals and debates during the time of the European product liability directive, which caused great
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
consternation to producers. Hon. Members of all parties want to avoid imposing impossible burdens on producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good discussion of how the consumer will fare. The hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) may consider taking his toaster on the tube—I suppose that that is more likely than him taking it on the bus, in his case—but for many of us frailer creatures the prospect of carrying larger items of domestic consumption, including computers, is not that realistic. The burdens on retailers would also be considerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are retailers that will deliver and remove material. People would not carry a fridge to a shop, would they? It is delivered and it can be taken away. That is the best practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the best practice. However, I do not think that we have received a complete answer from the Minister about how, if one orders a fridge or toaster through an internet company, which is a growing practice, those arrangements would be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister paid lip service to the competition argument, which needs to be a priority. This country's competitiveness, and that of other European producers, in relation to our international counterparts should be given due weight. I find myself in discord with the Government over that aspect. The European Scrutiny Committee raised some significant issues and my mind has not been put at rest. Major uncertainties remain, particularly about the WEEE proposal. Also, uncertainties have undoubtedly increased, as I think the Minister accepts, because of the pressures to shorten the implementation periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An aspect that we have not considered this morning and on which there was no opportunity to question the Commission this week, but which concerns me greatly, relates to whether we will ask the new applicant countries, which, it is hoped, will join the European Union after 2003–04, how the measures will affect them. We shall add to the acquis if the directives are adopted before the chapters that the Commission is currently negotiating have been concluded. That would worry me and my constituents greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is premature to lift the scrutiny reserve and that is why I cannot support the motion. Regrettably, I remain unconvinced by the Minister's explanation of her reasons for considering it necessary to lift the scrutiny reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be some confusion about the costs. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has outlined some of them. The initial regulatory impact assessment suggested for waste disposal alone an annual cost of between £540 million and £545 million, with one-off costs of £7.3 million and £8.6 million. Costs for the proposals on hazardous substances are estimated, in the initial regulatory impact assessment, at as much as £1.2 billion on a one-off basis, with unquantified on-going costs arising from the use of more expensive materials or increased energy use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
I should like guidance about something that this morning's discussions did not make clear. The figures that we have today are, as far as I am aware, those that were given in the initial regulatory impact assessment. The European Scrutiny Committee asked for an update of those figures and it is incumbent on the Minister and the Department to provide that update before they ask us to lift the scrutiny reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has not yet been any discussion this morning of who is to pay for training, which will be required by retailers, producers and local authorities. I understand from briefings that I have seen that no amount has been specified. If the Minister could share those figures with us, they would be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will rehearse the argument that I made during questions. The fifth framework directive remains the legal base for the directives, as the Minister is aware. However, in the Commission and among the member states, life has moved on. There is general agreement that the targets set under the fifth framework directive were not easily achievable. I humbly suggest to the Minister that the targets set under the sixth framework directive are a more appropriate way of achieving our aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of producer responsibility is not alien to Conservative Members, but the estimated costs are horrendous, for both the start-up and the continuation of the two directives. It will be difficult to implement the two proposals within the suggested time scale. The new legislation will give rise to historic costs, as well as the costs that we have discussed. By any estimate, the costs outweigh the potential advantages. The Minister should seek not a long delay, but the opportunity to switch to the targets of the sixth framework directive. The Commission and the member states seem to be reaching a unanimous agreement that that is the way forward. I am unable to support the motion as it stands, and look forward to the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I would like to respond to the points that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made. He raised the question of the role of local authorities, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster. Our waste strategy, which has been jointly adopted and proposed by my Department and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, sets statutory recycling targets for local authorities for the first time. They will therefore need to develop, for example, more effective kerbside collection and more adequate bring systems, which provide places to take our rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a strategy should effectively persuade every local council in the country to do what is necessary to meet challenging targets for recovery and re-use, and for waste minimisation. In future, as my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster concluded, the public will
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
have easier access to waste recovery and recycling depots. That will ease the current situation, and promote the change of culture that he discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned the need for a market-led strategy. Let us remember, however, the previous Government's approach. They identified six sectors in which the principle of producer responsibility was appropriate: packaging, newsprint, batteries, tyres, vehicles and the electrical and electronic equipment that we have discussed today. Yet the hon. Gentleman complained about packaging regulations. Those regulations were adopted as a result of the packaging and packaging waste directives, agreed in 1994 by his own Government, which he avidly supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Lady preaching, but is she arguing in favour of the regulations or not? Is this the best way—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is a serious point. I have been a Member of Parliament since 1997, and as a new Member I find a lot of the party political bickering that goes on in Parliament infuriating. I have written an article in 	<i>The Times</i> making that point to the public. If the hon. Lady believes that the packaging waste directive is right, she should say so and explain why, or she should say that it is wrong and do something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may so, the pot is calling the kettle black. It was the hon. Gentleman who started the party political bickering this morning. I do not go in for that, and it is a great pity when this scrutiny Committee, which plays such a valuable role, degenerates into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was complaining about the packaging waste regulations. Those regulations stem directly from a directive that the Conservative Government concluded in 1994.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to finish responding to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We gave effect to that in the regulations. The reason why they are complex is that they share the burden of producer responsibility throughout the packaging chain—the raw material manufacturers, the packaging converters, the packer-fillers and the retailers. The regulations were drafted in that way because most of the industry wanted that shared approach rather than a translation of the producer responsibility principle—which the Conservative Government proposed for the packaging sector—which placed the entire burden on only one part of the packaging chain. We are dealing with serious problems that the previous Government also tried to tackle in negotiations with the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I much prefer that answer. It is much more important to say whether the Government support that arrangement. That is what I want to hear as a Member of Parliament and as a member of the public. That is how the Minister should approach the matter, rather than saying that because it was done by the previous Conservative Government it is therefore right. It may not be right. The hon. Lady is in government because the previous Conservative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Government got so many things wrong, and she must say whether she supports the measure. I want to hear the principal arguments of the policy, not which tribe implemented it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can continue in that spirit of elucidation. If we get the two new directives right, they will send precisely the right signals to the market, which the hon. Gentleman would support. At the moment, the real environmental costs involved in producing electrical and electronic goods and disposing of them when they come to the end of their lives are being externalised on to the environment, which is the economist's jargon for saying that they are being dumped in landfill. Those costs are being externalised by producers to the detriment of the environment in which we all live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the principle of the approach and of producer responsibility that lies behind the directive and the packaging directive is absolutely right. It is about creating the right framework and the right market signals so that producers and other parts of the supply chain can act more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The waste resource and action programme, a joint initiative between my Department and the DETR, recognises that there are real market failures in turning what is currently treated as waste into a resource for further production. Markets for recyclates do not work well at the moment. We are trying, through the waste and resources action programme, to develop much more effective markets in, for instance, plastic and glass, which are two of the key components in the electrical and electronic equipment that are causing such problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assessment suggests that some aspects of the directive may encourage collection, for which the Minister is arguing passionately, while others, especially the cost of meeting recycling targets, may have the opposite effect. Is her Department aware that the proposals may have the perverse effect of doing the contrary to what she is hoping to achieve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes an important point. In a sense, there is a trade-off. There is a balance between how far we increase the separate collection of waste to reduce the amount going to landfill, and how far we can achieve the environmental objectives more effectively by taking that part of the waste that is already separately collected and getting more of it reused or recycled. Part of what is already separately collected is taken off for re-use and some is separated out and taken for recycling, but a significant proportion of what is left goes back to landfill. By increasing the recycling rates of what is already separately collected, we can reduce the amount going to landfill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if we increase the amount of waste that is separately collected, other environmental costs are involved, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said. Waste that may currently be going to landfill must, in future, be transported separately. There are environmental costs as well as benefits at different stages of the process. A really accurate cost-benefit analysis is complex because so many different
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
kinds of product are involved, and a complex value chain links the original production right through to the end of life. We are trying, reasonably effectively, to understand the nature of those costs and benefits and the trade-off between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our goal is simple—to agree sensible directives with the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the Parliament. Once that is done, we can examine how best to transpose those directives into United Kingdom law and ensure their practical implementation. We will continue to work with the electrical and electronic equipment industry to try to achieve cost-effective recycling, by developing new recycling techniques and stimulating new outlets for recycled material. The main lever that we can use for that is our own recycling programme and the waste and resources action programme to which I referred. We also have a research and development project under our recycling programme with the industry council for electronic equipment recycling that is designed to develop a new approach to cathode ray tube recycling, which is one of the most difficult parts to deal with in waste television sets. The technology for separating out different components, treating and possibly recycling them, is constantly changing. It is therefore important that we also invest in research and development with the industry to ensure that, in future, stuff that cannot currently be re-used or recycled may, with the development of new treatment techniques, become available for recycling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised the general issue of regulatory burdens, which is a concern that we share. I am surprised that the Opposition decided only last week to vote against the Regulatory Reform Bill that we introduced. This is not a party political point—one of the problems that we have is the weight of regulation that has built up, not only over the years but over the decades. I recently asked officials to dig out the weights and measure regulations, because they are of enormous concern to many thousands of businesses. A large pile of dusty, yellowing documents was delivered to my office—twenty years' worth of weights and measures regulation. I will refrain from making the obvious point about which twenty years those were, but my hon. Friends will understand. Each regulation had been placed on top of the other—legislatively, not literally. It was impossible to understand the latest change that had been made without understanding all the rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a particularly astute example. The hon. Lady will be aware that the Administration to which she alludes but does not name had a history of negotiating successive derogations in support of local business. Why have her Government not been minded to continue to apply for such derogations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been making the point that, through the current directives, we seek an exemption for small manufacturers and retailers, and I shall return to that point in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
It is difficult for any Government to find the time to simplify and update weights and measures regulations through primary legislation because many other things need to be done. The Regulatory Reform Bill will enable not a change of substance but simplification through secondary legislation. We will be able to deal much more effectively with the problem of 20 years' worth of weights and measures legislation—and a great deal else besides—in a way that makes sensible use of parliamentary time and eases the regulatory burden on business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the hon. Members for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton would support such a measure, and perhaps the hon. Lady is about to tell me that she does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my short time in the House, I have been struck by our lack of scrutiny of European legislation compared with that of Back-Bench Members of the European Parliament. I should have expected the Minister to see some attraction in using primary legislation. I mentioned the example of gold plating, and I could furnish a list of the many similar mistakes about which I am most concerned. Secondary legislation and statutory instruments acted as the model, and as a result there was insufficient discussion on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has invaluable experience of the legislative processes of the European Parliament and the House of Commons. Regardless of which party is in power, there is the real issue of what could be described as the Whitehall culture. We in this country are fortunate in having fine officials—many of whom, I am happy to say, are in my Department—and an outstanding tradition of public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is part of the civil service tradition that one crosses all the t's, dots all the i's, and tries to deal with every possible eventuality and every business in each nook and cranny of the sector in question. As a result, one ends up with absurdly complicated statutory instruments, guidance and forms. That is the culture that we have to change, and it is a matter not simply of parliamentary scrutiny—important though that is—but of establishing a much more effective process of regulatory impact assessment. We need to involve the Small Business Service, which we created and to which we gave a particular responsibility, in regulatory reform, and take on board the work of the better regulation taskforce. We are putting in place levers that will help to change the Whitehall regulatory culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious, Mr. Amess, that I have digressed slightly from the specific issue of the directives, so I shall turn to the other points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster. He was right to express a concern for small retailers. They are under enormous pressure and we do not want to make matters worse. Our analysis shows that 99 per cent. of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
electrical retailers in the UK are small, generally independent firms. Between them, they account for about 75 per cent. of all such outlets, but for about 20 per cent. of total turnover. They exactly parallel the small producers to which I referred, most of which are small and have an even smaller share of the market than their electrical retailer counterparts. That is why we are seeking an exemption for small retailers and small producers, and I am fairly confident that we will get it. That would relieve the vast majority of retailers from the burdens that could be associated with the directive, without compromising the achievement of environmental Bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for dealing with that specific point. Will she tell us about the general view in Europe on the matter? I get the impression that there is a similar balance in other European countries in respect of small electrical retailers. I am not asking for information about confidential negotiations, but is there a view that those countries should have similar exemptions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a growing understanding of the difficulties that the directive could cause for small retailers. We hope that the associations of retailers and producers will make their views known to other member states, as well as to the European Commission. They helped in the conclusions of the Lisbon summit last year, and the progress since made. At that summit we took the initiative and achieved agreement with our European partners on a small business charter. An important element of the charter is the commitment that, in considering regulations, the European Union will take particular account of their impact on small businesses and seek to reduce their burden. That is something that already happens in the United Kingdom. An exemption for small retailers would significantly reduce the estimated costs of £500 million per annum—as I said earlier, that estimate comes from the retail industry and has not been independently validated. We are working with the British Retail Consortium to see what can be done on that issue. Similarly, an exemption for small producers will reduce the total administrative costs of implementing the directive. It is vital that we achieve the flexibility we need in the directive and we are already doing so through the working group. That will allow us to implement the directive—when it emerges—with the least cost to business, and particularly to small business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster raised the important issue of timing. A divergence of views exists among member states on that question. Some want 60 months before the introduction of producer responsibility, others think that 18 months is the maximum acceptable period. In this country, the information technology industry is comfortable with 18 months, whereas the consumer electronics sector prefer 60 months. There is no single view, even among industries in the United Kingdom. We think that a compromise of a period of about 30 months before the introduction of producer responsibility should be acceptable and would assist industry. We would then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
like a gap of 12 months between that introduction and the deadline for the legal requirement to meet the recovery and recycling targets. That would give business an appropriate time in which to achieve the requirements. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his constructive points; they are on our agenda for negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Vale of York raised the issue of the toy safety directive, which was negotiated and implemented by the previous Government and she talked about gold-plating. Without knowing all the details, I think that her initial proposal to prevent giving old toys to charity shops is absurd. It is a good example of the need to change the culture of Whitehall, so that we have a common-sense approach to the negotiation and implementation of directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also raised the issue of e-commerce and purchases over the internet. We do not know how that will develop, but most of the products with which the directives are concerned are produced by local suppliers. For example, one may purchase a product from Dixon's over the internet, rather than from a shop. Regardless of where a retail shop is based on the internet, there still has to be local fulfilment. The goods that one buys are physical goods: they cannot be delivered virtually, but have to be delivered to one's home or office. That creates an opportunity for precisely the kind of take-back to which my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive does not say that: it says that the retail premises will be used as a place to take back the equipment. It makes no mention of goods being collected; the onus is on the consumer to take the goods to the premises. That is why many retailers are so opposed to it. Under voluntary schemes, whereby retailers voluntarily take back people's fridges and washing machines, those goods do not go to retail spaces in the high street, but to warehouses in cheap land miles away from anywhere, where specialists deal with all the waste products from throughout the country. The internet will not be covered by the directive as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, we are discussing e-commerce with the Commission. The hon. Gentleman should not get too hung up about the precise wording of the directive, because we are in the process of changing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive places obligations not on consumers, but on producers and retailers—in the case of retailers, to make take-back facilities available. I do not wish retailers to be required to come and collect goods: that would be too onerous, and I assume that it is not what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is proposing. In the case of goods that are purchased through e-commerce, the retailer has to arrange for those goods to be delivered to the purchaser's home or office, and it therefore makes sense for a take-back to be arranged at the same time. I am sure that that will at least be permitted by the directive, and it would be useful if we could ensure that it encourages it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens if someone purchases a toaster over the internet and it is delivered by the Royal Mail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then we can talk to the Royal Mail. I am not proposing that we should try to amend the directive to make a take-back by post compulsory. A toaster may not be a particularly good example, but for larger goods that are not necessarily delivered by the Royal Mail it may well be possible to arrange a take-back facility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the whole point of producer responsibility in this respect that it will make companies think about the issues and come up with solutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes exactly the right point. We are working with retailers and the industry to ensure that we have practical schemes of this kind and that they are permitted or encouraged by the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Vale of York mentioned the important issue of candidate countries. Debates like this are being closely followed in those countries. The Commission is well aware of the lasting impact of such directives on candidate countries, and it is entirely open to them to negotiate derogation from this part, and from other parts, of the acquis in the course of the negotiations on their membership of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered the cost issues to which the hon. Lady referred. Exemptions for small producers and retailers would substantially reduce both direct and administrative costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss McIntosh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the purposes of my report back to the European Scrutiny Committee, was a subsequent regulatory impact assessment conducted after the initial one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hewitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, we revised the regulatory impact assessment partly in the light of changes to the original draft directive. Those documents are included in the bundle that is before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a valuable and interesting debate, which has reflected the complexity and importance of the issues that are dealt with by the two directives. I have heard the concerns raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and I assure them that we share those concerns and that we have taken them into account in formulating our negotiating position. We are making real progress in agreeing with other member states amendments to the directive that will deal, in particular, with its impact on small firms and the issue of timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee will feel able unanimously to endorse the motion and to support our negotiating position on the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
