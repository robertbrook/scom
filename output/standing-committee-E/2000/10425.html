	<p>[	<i>Relevant Document: European Union Document No. 14329/00</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Robert Ainsworth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal before us is an important one for aviation safety. Although the draft regulation was forwarded to the Council only in December last year, its origins date from much earlier. To put the issues in context, I shall briefly outline the genesis of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In December 1996, the Commission made a recommendation for a Council decision authorising the Commission to start negotiations on the establishment of a European organisation responsible for civil aviation safety regulation, based on the existing informal body, the Joint Aviation Authorities or JAA. The Community had already legislated in the field through EC regulation 3922/91, which incorporated a number of JAA standards into Community law and provided a system for adding more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The June 1998 Transport Council mandated the Commission to negotiate the setting up of a European aviation safety authority, or EASA, as an international organisation. In preparation for such negotiations, representatives of member states agreed a draft outline treaty in October 1999. However, a few states—notably Ireland—raised potential constitutional problems in ratifying such a treaty. That led the Council to ask the Commission to draw up proposals for an alternative Community system, involving the creation of a Community agency— which is the proposal that we have before us today. The Government wrote to the European Scrutiny Committee on a number of occasions to keep hon. Members informed of developments, but did not submit an explanatory memorandum until the formal legislative proposal emerged. We have before us that explanatory memorandum, number 14329/00, dated 18 January 2001, and the Scrutiny Committee's report, dated 7 February 2001. I wrote on 22 March to the Chairman of that Committee to provide further information as requested and to welcome the recommendation for a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is a complex and important one and we want to get it right. The UK Government have always strongly advocated working together in Europe to harmonise and raise safety standards. In taking that line, we have enjoyed the consistent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
support and advice of the Civil Aviation Authority. We have also worked closely with, and enjoyed the support of, the UK manufacturing and airline industries. It is no secret that we originally favoured the option of an international organisation, but we recognise that there is no future in trying to establish such an organisation if the treaty on which it would be based could not in practice be ratified by all EU member states. We have therefore accepted that that is not a viable solution within a reasonable time scale and are fully committed to developing an alternative way forward. We need to move on and we now have a real opportunity to put aviation safety regulation in Europe on a sound long-term footing for the benefit of passengers, the general public and our industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detailed discussions are continuing in the Council's working group. A number of changes have already been proposed and we expect more. Various issues were brought before the April Council in Luxembourg and others will come up at the June Council. Although the Commissioner has said that she hopes for a common position in June, that is becoming increasingly unlikely: our latest information is that the European Parliament is unlikely to deliver its opinion before July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating only the EASA proposal. Although the European Scrutiny Committee originally recommended a joint debate on the aviation safety and EC single European sky proposals, we have agreed to keep the issues separate. In view of the continuing work on the draft EASA regulation, the Government welcome today's debate. I shall be pleased to respond to questions on the proposal's details and more generally on the Government's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. They should be brief and one at a time, so that all hon. Members may speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Syms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Poole)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister is not limping as badly as he was earlier this week and that he appears to be on the road to recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about the institutional architecture. We are debating a Community agency; are there other examples of such an agency? The membership of the organisation will include ins and outs—how will they interact? I note that the directive says that it will be possible for a Community member to go to the European Court for judgments. How will that impact on the proposed organisation and what will happen for countries that are outside the European Community but inside the agency? How will the means of control be established? Will it be done through the Council of Ministers or will a special committee be set up—perhaps including ambassadors of outside nations? My concerns centre on the interaction of those two parts to ensure that the proposed body works as a proper organisation and that countries outside the EC that subscribe to the organisation are slotted in properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal is not breaking new ground. There are other examples of agencies similar to the one that is proposed, most notably the Medicines Evaluation Agency. The hon. Gentleman is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
right that there could be difficulties with countries that are outside the European Union but want to be inside and working with the agency. However, those countries will be able to use the European Court of Justice. There have been discussions with such countries about their preparedness, and there do not appear to be any insurmountable problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome the Minister on what I think is his first visit to this Committee? As a long-time Committee member, it is good to see a veteran of the Committee that considered the recent Transport Bill here. With that in mind, he will recall countless hours of debate on the aviation part of that legislation and on consultation with the Ministry of Defence, particularly on European security forces and the RAF. What consultation has taken place on the proposals with security forces across Europe and, most importantly, with the RAF?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to explain the Government's position to the Committee and, obviously, consultation has taken place in Government and Government agencies. Our approach is supported by not only the CAA, the industry and the airlines in the UK, but the MOD; neither have we had any indication of opposition or problems envisaged by other European states about that, so we do not see a problem. The directive, limited as it is to product certification and the rest, applies only to civil aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister about the 40 pages of specification and detail that apply to aeroplanes and helicopters and appear towards the end of the document. Will he tell us who is responsible for ensuring that aeroplanes and helicopters are safe to fly and comply with all the appropriate regulations, and whether that will be altered in any way by the creation of the proposed organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The CAA is responsible for all aircraft under the British register. It will continue to be the responsible body and to issue airworthiness certificates. However, it is important to recognise that in this area, more than in any other, we cannot simply be an island. It has long been recognised that there is a need to work together with other organisations to lift standards across a wider area, so the agency will be responsible for setting the standards according to which those certificates will be issued. That will apply to our own CAA as well as to other European CAA equivalents in the other European states that sign up to the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend draw the Committee's attention to areas that have not been covered in the document but are vital in terms of aviation safety, and specifically the physical infrastructure associated with airports and landing strips? He is aware that I am a chartered civil engineer. I am not sure whether I should declare an interest in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
the debate as a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Certainly in terms of codes of practice associated with physical infrastructure, it is important to know how the proposals would have an impact on design criteria, and the physical implementation of safety around our airports and airfields.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulation covers product and type certification, the rule-making associated with product, and the setting of standards for the issue of airworthiness certificates by the CAA. There is an intention, spelled out in the documentation, to consider those other issues that are currently covered by the JAA relating to the standards that apply to the licensing of aircrew, airports and air traffic management systems. However, that would have to be covered in further regulation that would also require parliamentary scrutiny. Currently, the regulation is limited to the areas I mentioned earlier, but there is an intention to broaden it at some later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a chequered and frustrating history in bringing us from the JAA over many years to the current position. I support the creation of the agency and what it seeks to do. There are a number of other important areas that the report focuses on. The Minister is perhaps not in a position to tell us when he expects the other areas to be brought within the agency's remit and for it to be a fully functioning body, but what is his ambition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, as the hon. Gentleman predicts, impossible to say. It has been a long road to where we are now, and there were other proposals that we supported along the way. As I recognised in my opening address, we were not able to implement those. Both the manufacturing industry and the airline operators in this country would like us to go further than the current regulation. There is pressure to do so, and much support for a European CAA. We have been at the forefront of those discussions, because we can see huge benefits, not only to our industry but to the travelling public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The CAA has been one of the great successes of this country. The regulation moves a great degree of competence outside national control. Within these documents and the morass of paperwork there is a suggestion that Europe may wish to take over registration and the regulation of air traffic control and airports in the future, as the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) said. Does the Minister see that happening, and when does he believe that Europe will make its proposals in that area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question is broadly the same as that asked by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), from my days in Committee on the Transport Bill. We have a very good record of and reputation for air safety, and our aviation industry has been successful over a long time. However, we have long recognised the need to move forward and the fact that we cannot do a job within our own boundaries. There is more European integration on aircraft manufacture than in many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
other industries, and the aviation industry is governed by various international agreements, as hon. Members know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can satisfy ourselves that we have got the structure right and that the agency will have the strength to make the improvements that we envisage are possible with the proposal, it will be our intention to bring other areas within EASA's framework, but I cannot say how quickly we will be able to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the answer that the Minister gave me earlier, is there evidence that other countries that will be affected by the agreement have standards that are unacceptably low or lower than ours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have asked that question many times in preparation for this debate and in trying to get on top of the brief that I now have as a Minister. I am told that there are variations in standards, but they are not the main issue for air safety in other countries. The way in which standards are enforced, applied and monitored—which has been very effective in this country—tends to lead to far more variation than the standards or rules themselves. The fact that we have the expertise of the CAA, which takes air safety extremely seriously, leads to the good record that we have in the UK. We are not necessarily applying standards higher than those in other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is probably aware that the European Parliament's Transport Committee feels that the proposals lack imagination and backbone in some respects. It is especially concerned about the proposed organisation's perceived autonomy. Do the British Government have a view on that? Would the traditional British approach in this area find favour with our partner nations in Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee's view is as my hon. Friend describes, it does not concur with the general thrust of what we are trying to achieve. We want an agency with a high degree of autonomy within the competence that has been decided for it. It should be able to develop its credibility and reputation, so that it can not only ensure that its standards are properly enforced throughout the European Union but deal effectively with organisations outside Europe such as the Federal Aviation Administration. It is essential that we get the structure right and that we ensure to the maximum degree possible that safety considerations are ring-fenced and not impinged on by other considerations that inevitably affect inter-state relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our negotiating position has been to try to make certain that the agency is independent in respect of the standards that it is obliged to enforce. It must be given resources to recruit the staff who will give it the credibility necessary to improve standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other agencies throughout the European Union might have similar responsibilities, but some of us doubt whether the rules and regulations prescribed in specific countries are enforced. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), the Minister said that the enforcement authority in this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
country would be the Civil Aviation Authority— nothing wrong with that—but what surety or assurance can he give the Committee that the respective authorities in other countries will enforce the measures? If they do not, what is the point of the co-operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to avoid the wider European debates that often break out in this place. Co-operation must obtain in this respect, because the JAA is not a legally based organisation capable of enforcing its decisions within individual countries that sign up to agreements. We are left to reach a consensus in the first place and it is then up to the agencies in individual states to enforce what has been agreed—not necessarily best done on a uniform basis, as I acknowledged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why our own CAA has stressed the need for a legally based agency capable of imposing standards, inspecting them and ensuring that they are enforced within member states. The CAA is not frightened of those standards being applied to itself. It is happy to have our systems inspected. It and the Government see great benefits in ensuring that standards are also inspected and imposed in other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Joint Aviation Authority—we all know about its problems—generally tried to work closely with the FAA in the United States. The size of the aviation market there made that a sensible option. The European Aviation Safety Agency is now being set up, so can the Minister assure us that it will collaborate with the FAA rather than compete with it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that there are other agendas within the European Union—particularly a social agenda that deals with passenger rights, what happens in the cabin and so forth, in order to popularise what the EU is achieving. The agenda is not always relevant purely to safety issues. My main concern with this new organisation emerging in Europe is whether it will lead to worldwide collaboration. There will be great benefits for this country if it does, but if the different authorities view each other as rivals without the same agenda, it could create problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. What he says brings us back to the issue of trying to insulate the agency from any concerns other than aviation safety. EASA must become a strong and credible organisation that can deal with the FAA as a partner. If it is established in that way, it will bring huge benefits well beyond the boundaries of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FAA has looked and commented on these proposals as they have been developed. Many of its points are in line with the Government's proposals for a proper structure and clear accountability. There are no fundamental differences between its concerns and the position adopted by the British Government in negotiations to establish EASA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the financial statement? Regarding the financing of the proposed agency, has consultation with national airline operators taken place? Page 93 deals with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
fees generated by interested parties—stakeholders, I suppose we would call them. Has there been any consultation with, or feedback from, British companies involved in manufacture for national and European operators? Does the level of fees envisaged in the document have any correlation with the situation in the North American market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal is not different from what applies now, in that the fees pay for certification. There will be a transitional period, and we recognise that the figures might not be at exactly the right level at first. There might be some subsidy from the Budget during that initial period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK industry pays such fees now, and we do not expect to depart from that. The proposal was developed and discussed with the industry, and there have not been any significant objections. It is an issue, because the proposal could involve costs resulting from fragmentation of our industry. The costs of the European certification system that are imposed on our industry are not comparable with costs to the Americans. The lack of such costs to the American industry gives it a competitive advantage. Further improvements and cost reductions can be made, but I believe that the British industry recognises the potential and supports the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that fees are raised as much by the FAA in the United States, so this is a relevant competition issue. The back page of the directive states that no figures are available with respect to the financial implications and regulatory impact assessment, and that the figures could change, depending on the type, certification and size of aircraft that will be encompassed in the scheme. I am not happy that we do not have any figures, because we are passing a regulation under which that is an important factor, particularly for manufacturers and airlines in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason that there are no figures is that cost benefits are envisaged as a result of the proposal. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that FAA fees are non-existent in some areas, and that provides a competitive advantage. However, the UK industry already operates within a certification system under the JAA, and the rules that apply to the JAA do not provide for regulatory impact assessments. The rules for EASA do provide for RIAs, and we might achieve a more balanced approach as a result. Such studies have not been necessary in the past, and there has been a need for overall consensus within the JAA.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some disappointment was expressed by countries that are members of the JAA but not of the European Union that the original proposal for an international JAA-based legal agency were not implemented; we were disappointed as well, because we thought that the difficulties could have been surmounted. The non-EU JAA countries accept the difficulties that have arisen, but because they know that there are benefits for them as well as for the EU countries, there is no great opposition to the proposal for an EU-based agency, despite the fact that they would have preferred the original proposal to have gone through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell us anything about the proposed location of the headquarters or the staffing of the organisation? Over the last few years, this Committee has seen many similar proposals and its members have regularly asked whether that type of organisation might be headquartered in the United Kingdom, bearing in mind the significance of English to the industry. Can he give us any grounds to hope that the headquarters might be set up in the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The growing use of English in the EU is a great advantage to us, but there also issues of access and different countries are bidding to provide the headquarters. Our main concern has been about the staffing of the agency. We have tried to ensure that not only is it headed up by an appropriate individual, but that it has the quality of staff to build the kind of reputation that will be needed. Most of the thrust of our negotiations has been to ensure that staffing arrangements are appropriate and that the budget is adequate to attract people of the necessary calibre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to come on to that topic. The importance of high quality staff is emphasised in the Minister's letter and the paperwork. is. Whenever I have dealt with it, I have always been surprised by how small the CAA is. It has been successful because it has been able to rely on the airlines and the air traffic control organisations to ensure that safety is paramount at every level. Are we confident that there are enough trained staff given that we will inevitably lose some of our CAA staff to the other organisation? As air traffic control has already been split from the CAA, there must a limited number of people with the necessary skills. Other countries on the continent may not have our levels of excellence and there may be an initial staff shortage. What initiatives do the Government intend to take either nationally or internationally to ensure that there are sufficient staff to secure the safety standards that the agency wants to institute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be frank with the hon. Gentleman. There is always a lack of suitably qualified and competent staff in almost any area. I have not thought about the size of the pool of labour and talent and how the agency can be set up, but I am confident that we will be able to cope. I will look into the issue that the hon. Gentleman raises because it is important.

As for location, although we would be interested in having the organisation in the UK, it might be difficult to agree that it, too, should be based in London, given that we have secured the medicines agency and everything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I be clear on one point? There is nothing in the regulation that is not in other respects covered by existing arrangements. In other words the process is simply a bringing together on a EU-wide basis of all the existing regulations, requirements and specifications that are currently covered by other bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The areas covered by the regulation are all part of the work that is already done within the JAA, but they do not comprise all of the work that is done within the JAA. As I have said, people in the industry want to go much further and faster than we are prepared to go, but that is not possible. If the agency is to develop, it will be on an incremental basis. Further regulations may well be proposed, but the regulation before us is limited to only part of the work of the JAA, concentrating primarily on product, certification and other issues on which we already work within that organisation, such as pilot and airline certification standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch in Farnborough has an excellent reputation. Will the regulation have any impact on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it will have no impact. Air investigations will continue to be carried out by the same organisations as now. The regulation also provides that in an emergency of any sort, our CAA has the ability to react and to take the necessary action. There will be retrospective discussions, but we will maintain at a national level the flexibility to react to any emergency that might arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a more general question about aviation policy? The EU has its single skies proposals. Europe now has the aviation safety agency whose competence, the papers tell us, may well expand into airports and air traffic control. The Minister has repeatedly said that there is support in the industry, but I am not sure that industries always speak with one voice. Sometimes one hears a different view from Virgin, which is rather more pro-Europe than British Airways. One of the jewels in our crown is Heathrow slot allocation. There seems to be a movement of competence away from national decision making to European decisions in that area. Can the Minister reassure us that we will not sacrifice Heathrow slot allocation on the altar of being at the heart of Europe? As we all know, Europe wanted to negotiate with the United States for slot allocation and everything else, and Heathrow could be one of the things that it could give the United States. That would have a big impact on our airlines. I hope that I am not being xenophobic here, but there are still national interests that should concern us as a national Parliament, such as defending the interests of airspace policy, airlines and airports. I should like a reassurance, as we seem to be on a slippery slope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely true that industries do not always speak with one voice; neither do Oppositions. I detected some differences during the passage of the Transport Act 2000. Some Opposition Members were pragmatic in their attitude towards Europe, but then I read the hon. Member's comment on aviation safety in which he told us in no uncertain terms that he believed in the nation state and that the Opposition were opposed to the EASA. A dogmatic belief in the nation state precludes any other considerations. Slot allocation is already an EU competence, but we retain control of Heathrow. It has nothing to do with that regulation. If we were to change that some discussion would be needed, but it is not on the table. We retain our competence in negotiations with the US over Heathrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that he had had several representations about the regulation. Has he received any representations from the aircraft production industry? Does it consider the regulation helpful in improving the competitive position of the European aircraft industry vis-à-vis the rest of the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we have had representations from the aircraft industry not only in favour of the proposals before us, but potentially in favour of going further. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to, I will refer to some of those representations in the debate that follows the questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note in the papers that there will be a stakeholders or workers board with representatives that will be consulted, and that there will be means to appeal—including an appeals board—against decisions taken by the organisation. Is the Minister confident that that will develop as an efficient organisation and not a bureaucratic body that takes slow decisions? It is important that in industry quick decisions are taken to maintain efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's line on the establishment of the aviation safety agency is to achieve precisely that. Once we have decided at treaty level the standards that should be applied, we must ensure that the agency's ability and structure for staff recruitment and accountability are such that it can take quick decisions within the applied competence. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, if we do not get it right, we will achieve nothing, so we have pushed that exact point in the establishment of the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the question asked by my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are arrangements, and discussions have taken place to allow such countries to use the European Court of Justice system to raise issues and ensure that standards are applied across the board in their own countries in the same way as throughout the EU.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Eurocontrol proposals, which the Community aims to join, have been blocked because of a dispute over Gibraltar—perhaps because the Spanish believe in the nation state. Will the Minister comment on that and where we stand on Eurocontrol? He knows that the Opposition have grave concerns about the impact of the EU joining Eurocontrol, which has been working perfectly well. Does the Minister think that the current impasse with Spain over Gibraltar, which seems to skew all Spanish foreign policy, will be overcome soon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals impact on other areas of work, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, but that has not been raised in the context of the establishment of the EASA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Poole is right to raise Gibraltar, because there is widespread feeling there that Britain has missed many opportunities to resolve difficulties that have arisen between Gibraltar and Spain by conceding so easily on many issues, not least aviation. Will the Minister tell us whether, in respect of the regulation before us, Britain will be prepared to play hardball and try to get the Spanish to take a more grown-up and friendlier attitude to Gibraltar, not least in civil aviation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know in what respect the hon. Gentleman thinks that we have not done the business. He must realise that we have been at the forefront of developing the proposals. He seemed to suggest that, to batter the Spanish into acting on Gibraltar, we should block something that we see as hugely beneficial to the EU and our industry and population. That would not be at all sensible. Of course we must stand up on the issue of Gibraltar and hope that the Spanish Government do not allow their difficulties with it to affect other areas and prevent progress that would benefit everybody. If they do as they have done in other areas, it would cause difficulties, but it would not be constructive to adopt a tit-for-tat approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 14329/00, a draft Council Regulation on establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation and creating a European Aviation Safety Agency; considers that the establishment of a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Community can best be achieved by the establishment and implementation of common rules which are developed and monitored centrally; agrees that the operation of the single market would also be improved by the establishment of a Community body for the certification of aeronautical products; supports the Government's position that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
the model mapped out in the draft Regulation could provide the building blocks to meet these objectives by improving the present European safety regulation system, the key elements being that the Agency is endowed with the necessary powers and sufficient autonomy to exercise its responsibilities, to attract high quality staff and to make certification decisions efficiently and effectively; and supports the Government's intention to press for this approach in the EU.</p></blockquote>
The range of questions asked this morning and the complexity of many of the issues raised explains why the motion is especially long. I shall summarise the key objectives that the Government want to achieve through the draft regulation, most of which have already been touched on. The Government are convinced that Europe needs a powerful, legally based safety body to drive up standards, ensure their uniform implementation, provide efficient certification processes for European industry and present a European safety culture to third countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the draft regulation provides the basic building blocks for setting up a Community agency as such a body. Our aim is to ensure that the new arrangements will meet three key objectives: first, the agency itself should have sufficient responsibilities and autonomy to ensure that safety rules and certification decisions are adopted more effectively and efficiently than under the current joint arrangements; secondly, where member states retain responsibility for implementing rules and standards, they should participate fully in technical development work; and, thirdly, non-EU European states, especially those that are members of the JAA, should be sufficiently involved in the new system to ensure that we harmonise and raise safety standards throughout Europe as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having outlined the Government' s views on some of the fundamental issues relating to the draft regulation, I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.18 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Syms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Poole)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to say that I support the nation state because it has been the most successful creation in modern history and has served this country well, but that does not mean that there are not occasions on which it is sensible to collaborate with international bodies on such a measure. Common sense should be used. The Minister will know that the Opposition were disappointed that the JAA approach was to go into the European Aviation Safety Agency as a community agency. We were not convinced that that was necessary. The Minister has explained that it was because of the Irish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are where we are and we ought to take note of the fact that post and pre-war Britain has had an extremely safe, well run aviation industry. The CAA has done a splendid job. We have good air traffic control. We have always had the benefit of the highest standards in Europe and some of the highest, if not the highest, in the world. There is concern that changing to a different footing, with states with different safety standards coming together, might lead to a common standard being set across a number of states that is less exacting than that currently enjoyed within the United Kingdom. We face the challenge to level everyone up

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
to British standards on airspace policy and the aircraft industry, rather than fall to the standards of some European countries. Key questions have been raised about the speed at which the organisation is set up, the high quality of personnel required to undertake the task and, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) and others, the number of staff sufficient to ensure that at every level the highest safety standards and the standards set by the organisation are specifically observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As always, there is a constantly shifting agenda. That causes me concern, as does the EU's political agenda to take over control of our skies. We would have more confidence in the EU's expansion into some areas if it tried to fulfil its existing responsibilities well. If the EU makes a success of the EASA and we come to respect it as a great organisation, Ministers will get a better hearing for proposals to expand the EASA's activities. As it is, when I look through the papers, I constantly read that there will be further Community proposals for a whole range of areas. Subsidiarity should mean doing things better and the EU has yet to prove its worth in many areas. The regulation is important for safety and the aircraft industry, so it must be got right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the highest standards. Despite being tempted to do so, we will not divide the Committee simply because we would not win the vote. We will, however, watch carefully how the episode unfolds. It is hoped that the Community agency will do well to the extent that we have confidence about its moving into other areas, rather than feeling that after constant political battles, more and more powers are to be taken from a nation state that has discharged its responsibilities remarkably well over the past 50 or so years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The motion is right to concentrate on high uniform standards. It refers to the critical matters of the agency's powers and autonomy, as well as to efficient and effective exercise of responsibility, and it accurately reflects the stage of development reached by the European Aviation Safety Agency. I hope that everyone will support the Government motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of important issues have been touched on in questions. The EASA supersedes the JAA. Contrary to comments made by the hon. Member for Poole, I suggest that the JAA is past is sell-by date. The JAA has been described as a camel train that goes at the pace of the slowest. In my judgment, it has not met the aspirations and objectives that it was designed to meet. I am not pointing the finger of blame at any particular section of the JAA, merely stating that the general consensus is that it is time to move on, so the proposals before us are timely. We must ensure—not merely try to ensure—that the mistakes and shortcomings of the JAA are not replicated in the EASA. If they are, we shall suffer much grief and worry in future. We are moving from a voluntary, discretionary, consensus organisation—the JAA—to a legally binding European Union organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
That safety standards vary is self-evident. I shall not debate the point with my hon. Friend the Minister today, but when he says that it is the variations rather than the standards themselves that are the problem, I cannot agree. Variations are from standards—which must be of the highest order—that are already set: then, we can identify the variations. The JAA has 27 members comprising a significant proportion outside the EU, whereas the new body will be an EU institution. We should not, however, think that only those outside the EU have problems with standards. I note that my hon. Friend the Minister has a copy of the Transport Sub-Committee report on aviation safety prominently displayed in front of him. I have no doubt that he has read it cover to cover and that he agrees that it is a mistake to think that only "that lot out there" have problems with standards. There are also difficulties within the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the critical point about the negotiations. Of course it is right for the UK to be at the forefront of the establishment of a European dimension that will set and implement the highest possible safety standards. The notion that we as a country should be concerned with safety only within our boundaries is, frankly, nonsense. Many of our citizens fly all over Europe and the world, so it is important, as the Minister said, to have high safety standards elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me illustrate the point. The JAA is a consensus organisation and does not possess the legal status and powers of the new agency, so member countries can either apply or refuse to apply what the JAA decides. There are no sanctions. The Select Committee, of which I am proud to be a member, asked the safety regulation group—an important part of the CAA—a specific question. What would happen if implementing a JAA agreement throughout its member states, including the UK, meant that standards in this country were lowered? The head of the group, Mr. Profit, said that if JAA standards were inadequate, the SRG would apply the higher UK standard. That is an extremely important safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that even if we are not satisfied that the decisions of the European Aviation Safety Agency are adequate, the UK will have no alternative but to implement them. That is the difference. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that that issue should be of prime importance in his discussions with other European Union members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to be satisfied that subsidiarity and added value, to which the Commission's document refers, are meaningful concepts for the citizens whom we represent, surely we must get the balance right. The highest possible standards apply in the UK because of the record of the CAA and its safety regulation group, which are without peer in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on an important issue. There will be a substantial change, particularly as we move towards majority voting in EASA. The CAA will become a subsidiary organisation, because it will, in effect, carry out EASA's requests. We should ponder that important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, but I do not necessarily share what I think is the motivation behind it, for two reasons. The Conservative party in the mid-1980s was responsible for transferring more matters to qualified majority voting than any other Government in this country's history. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that the Government are doing something wrong, I suggest, with the greatest respect, that he should be a little more careful, because the Conservatives' record in this regard is significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can be assured that the organisation will have the highest possible objectives and standards, and that these will not be diluted in the UK or elsewhere, qualified majority voting—in the case of the EASA's administration board, a two-thirds majority—will have definite advantages. If one thing has prevented real reform of the common agricultural policy among other things, it is unanimity, which is often a block on progress, rather than a weapon to assist it. I do not necessarily take the same view as the hon. Member for Poole, but his point is important in the context of the switch from the JAA to legally binding regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns our old friends at the European Commission. I had the privilege—or the disadvantage, depending on where people are on the political spectrum—of spending 10 years in the European Parliament and had the opportunity to see the Commission at work from close quarters. It is a tight-knit collegiate club, which does not see itself as accountable to anyone, in effect. Some people, even in my own party, may disagree. When it comes to subsidiarity and accountability, the Commission should be targeted, not the Council of Ministers; but that is another matter. We are talking about regulation that effectively gives the Commission overall control, and I am extremely worried about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to documents from the Commission, one of the EASA's objectives will be to assist the Commission in its management and implementation of the regulations; not the other way round. The EASA will assist, and the Commission will have the final say. I think that that is fraught with all sorts of problems. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to bear that in mind when he continues his discussions about the matter on behalf of the UK Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission's approach is reflected by a comment in the document; that safety levels and
	<br><blockquote><p>"targets should be specified in sufficiently broad terms to allow innovation and competition".</p></blockquote>
That is Euro-speak for "We'll control it." The Commission will have the say, at the end of the day, which bothers me considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to support my hon. Friend and the Government in their approach to such a critical issue. Discussions are continuing. I was delighted to hear my hon. Friend say that the Commission is hoping to reach a common position in June. That is hardly realistic, so we will have more time to address the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For me, the issue is not about the UK Government being at the forefront in establishing organisations that will set the highest possible air safety standards in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Europe and elsewhere. That is right and laudable, and I support my hon. Friend in that purpose; it is what the Government should be doing. However, we are moving from the Joint Aviation Authority— effectively a discretionary organisation whose decisions the safety regulation group of the CAA can implement or not—to the legally binding, legally based European Aviation Safety Agency. Then, we will be able to insist that the highest possible standards, which have applied in this country for decades—as is recognised throughout the world—are not only maintained and protected, but form the base for the EASA's activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can achieve that goal—if my hon. Friend can do so—I will fully support the establishment of an agency that will have as its prime purpose the extension of the highest possible safety standards, which we are proud and privileged to have in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the remarks of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson). In response, I point out to the Committee that if Parliament continues to give more powers to the European Commission through this or any other regulation or directive, the ability of hon. Members to answer, as they should do, to the electorate will be that much diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation, like every other, puts the power not with the House of Commons, nor with the duly elected representatives of the British people, but with the unelected and the unaccountable in Brussels. The hon. Gentleman quite rightly pointed out that the regulation gives more powers to the European Commission, and he was concerned about how the Commission would exercise those powers. What was illogical about his argument was his conclusion that it is best to proceed and adopt the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the comments that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole made in standing up for the nation state. He pointed out to the Committee that the nation state has served our country so well for so many years and is, in our estimation, the ideal structure for delivering accountable government, in a way that the European Community cannot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments and justifications that we have heard in favour of the regulation are very seductive; it is difficult to argue against anything that concerns safety. However, I cannot agree with the argument that bigger is better. It is a view that socialists can easily follow and support, and I can understand why. It is their position, but it is not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of being ruled out of order, Sir David, I wish to say that what is currently affecting my constituents is the consequences of foot and mouth disease. However, what is different between now and the outbreak in 1967 is that we have a larger bureaucracy, which is answerable to the Commission and must go cap in hand to it to get permission to proceed. There is no local, regional or national autonomy, which, in 1967, could deliver answers and find a better and quicker resolution to the problem.

The danger of putting more regulations on the statute book is that although in theory they might be fine and have a broad appeal, they create bigger organisations that cover many areas and countries, and represent but an ideal. As my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said, if we were to divide on the regulation, I would almost certainly vote against it. Of course, I am not opposed to air safety, but I am opposed to the creation of bigger conglomerations, which, in the event of necessity, prove practically incapable of delivering decisions. They also mean that we, as Members of Parliament, are no longer accountable to our people, as we should be. That situation may suit some hon. Members; I do not know. I am not a Member of Parliament for the sake of it. I have come here to do the best job that I can for my constituents and I am always prepared to be answerable to them. We cannot be answerable if we continue to give away control of air safety, or of any other matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure how I feel about the fact that the hon. Member for Ludlow finds some of my arguments seductive. He asked for some indication of support from the industry for the proposal. I have a letter to Lord MacDonald from the Society of British Aerospace Companies. I could send the hon. Gentleman a copy, but I shall read out the most appropriate sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We understand the reasoning for the EU agency, which may indeed be a practical way to achieve what the industry sees as needed as a matter of urgency."</p></blockquote>
That is the level of support from SBAC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was concerned that we were transferring our power, as elected Members, to an undemocratic organisation in Brussels. After examining the regulation and its powers, I do not see that argument. We have already delegated such powers, as elected Members, to the CAA. We have decided that it is not appropriate for us, as politicians, to do that job, and that we must have a credible organisation, free from political interference, to govern aviation safety so that we can achieve the standards that we want to enjoy in the United Kingdom. Such powers have been given to the CAA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation gives some of the powers exercised by the CAA to a potential EASA. The CAA does not object to that; it has been party to the development of the proposals, supports them and believes that they are in the interest of advancing aviation safety. I cannot
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
agree with the hon. Gentleman if he thinks that we are stripping ourselves of our democratic rights through the regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister will concede that the CAA is directly answerable to Parliament in a way that the EASA will not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of the day, the CAA is accountable to the Government and Parliament, as are many other organisations. However, we recognise that it is possibly more important in this area than in any other to delegate responsibility to an appropriate body with appropriate expertise, and build up its credibility so that it can control and further the interests of the aviation industry and safety. To suggest that that is not a sensible approach is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the sense in having a national organisation, so that one stands alone in glorious isolation, apart from what is happening on the rest of the continent, and ignoring the fact that our industry is integrated with that of the continent and that the overwhelming majority of flights bought by our constituents, for pleasure or business, are to other countries. I do not believe that the CAA, or the industry, see any sense in that position; they believe that our proposal is sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister makes an important point. Does he agree that the success of the CAA has been largely due to the fact that it is almost free-standing? That leads to the question of how much autonomy the EASA will have. The documents state that the EASA will be required to assist the Commission, rather than the other way around.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just about to move on to the points raised by my hon. Friend, who will see that I have been leafing through his interrogation of people on this issue in past forums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His comments about the degree of autonomy are right. It is key that we get the right balance between what is contained in the treaty, the powers that are given to the Commission and the autonomy given to the agency. If we do not have a sufficiently autonomous agency, we will not achieve anything or have the kind of body we want. My hon. Friend has got to the crux of the matter, but I am not sure that some of the issues that he raised and the phraseology that he used to support his argument—which was that we were giving away power to the Commission—are correct. The debate will continue, and I will think about what he has said. However, if we want aviation safety measures effectively enforced across the continent, a legal framework set up for that and the legal powers to make sure that others are subjected to inspection—and, if necessary, action as a last resort— who else does my hon. Friend think will provide support to the Commission? The Commission will not contain the expertise. We will be looking to the agency to contain and develop the expertise that will not only assist the Commission to do its job, but provoke the Commission to examine what is necessary to advance aviation safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
My hon. Friend mentioned looking to the agency to advise the Commission. The Commission will need the advice of a reputable, high-calibre agency in exactly the same way as the British Government badly need the CAA to provide necessary advice about the existing legal framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what my hon. Friend has said. One can find millions of reasons not to take action, rather than looking for the relatively few reasons why we should. I will be content if, as I hope will be the case, the CAA will be responsible for implementing the decisions of the EASA in the UK. I also hope that the EASA is as free-standing as possible, so that high quality expertise within it can develop. I remain concerned that, in the first instance, the agency will be accountable to the Commission, whose record on monitoring and implementing a swathe of European regulations does not fill me with the greatest confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind admitting that my hon. Friend has sufficient background in the subject to be ahead of me in some parts of it. He is absolutely right that we need the CAA to continue as the body implementing the standards provided by the EASA. We need its ability and input to ensure that the EASA is working and developing a reputation like that of the CAA. If the CAA were asked to give certification at an inappropriate standard, it would not be slow in saying so to the European agency, as well as making the British Government well aware that it did not think that the agency was working as effectively as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South mentioned another important concern. Reading his earlier comments—and listening to his remarks here—about the difference between standards and implementation, I, too, am concerned. I will continue to discuss that with him, and follow it up with officials. I have had lengthy discussions to try to understand where the difference lies. Although he is right that standards are not uniform, the main problem in achieving high safety levels is in the implementation, control, verification and accountability of those standards, not in the standards themselves. I know that he takes a different view on that, and has done for a long time, and I will not dismiss his arguments without continued examination of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is concerned that we have said that safety standards need to be couched in broad terms. The reason is that we do not want an over-bureaucratic, over-prescriptive system, especially where the type specification of aircraft is concerned. That would stifle innovation. The industry and its expertise will develop new generations of aircraft, and while we want to make absolutely certain that they are safe, we do not want regulations that say, "You will not do this, you will not do that", and then prevent talent from working on the problem and developing products. That is why we have kept the terms broad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister presume that, without a plethora of regulation, an aircraft producer would want to produce an aircraft that was not entirely safe? Does he not concede that if Boeing or any other manufacturer made an unsafe aircraft, which led to a fatality, its reputation and business would be destroyed? Anyone in manufacturing industry has a built-in incentive to produce a reliable product because they have to give satisfaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not presume that. Equally, however, I do not presume that it would be acceptable to the hon. Gentleman's constituents, or to mine, if we left the setting of safety standards to individual aircraft manufacturers and said that there was no necessity for outside agencies, Government control or international standards. The industry does not argue against that; it supports most of the existing controls and the developments that we are discussing. I reverse the hon. Gentleman's question and ask him why he presumes that the industry is wrong and that he is right about the great dangers that exist?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Poole attempted to increase his credibility with the Eurosceptic wing of his party by making comments about the supremacy of the nation state, and by appearing to be unable to be pragmatic about the matter. However, I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South was a bit unfair to him. I have had lots of opportunities, when sitting on the Whips' Bench, to look into the eyes of the hon. Member for Poole as some of his colleagues have put such points of view. I am not at all sure that his opinions are really so extreme. His remarks may have more to do with collective responsibility on the Opposition Front Bench than with his own views. Now I am trying to destroy my credibility with the very people with whom I tried to build it up earlier on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Syms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his kind comments. There are genuine concerns about policy direction, as there is so much happening in a wide area, from European control to what is happening to the national air traffic control system. I am happy to commit a Conservative Government to holding a debate on aviation after the election, if we happened to win. Could the Minister commit his Government to such a debate? The House should have an opportunity to debate the topic as a whole rather than in bite-sized chunks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know exactly what the hon. Gentleman means. We are having a debate on aviation now. The debates will take place not only in this Committee and end at one o'clock; they will go on. If he thinks that I can expect businesses managers in a future Parliament to allocate a day of parliamentary time for a debate on aviation, he is wrong. He well knows that I could not do that for this Parliament, never mind the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Poole is right that there are genuine concerns, and he has raised some of them. The debate must continue. He tried to hint that I was suggesting that the Irish were to blame for the failure of the international dimension to the proposed European air safety committee. I was not trying to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
that; I was pointing out that we believed that a way could have been found around the constitutional problems. I say that quite freely. We did not do so, and the opportunity was lost. We now have the proposal that is before us; nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Poole suggested that this kind of process would have more credibility if we sought to do existing things well before we moved on. If he looks at the proposal, he will see that the overwhelming majority of measures in the regulation concern existing areas; those that already operate beyond the boundaries of simply UK control. I hope that he does not believe that no one should look further and examine other areas in which it might be appropriate to have more than national control in the interests of safety and the development of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Poole rightly says that we have a successful aviation industry in this country, and we do not want to lose it. That is why we are putting forward the proposal. We believe that it is in the interests of the development, competitiveness and safety of the industry. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 14329/00, a draft Council Regulation on establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation and creating a European Aviation Safety Agency; considers that the establishment of a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Community can best be achieved by the establishment and implementation of common rules which are developed and monitored centrally; agrees that the operation of the single market would also be improved by the establishment of a Community body for the certification of aeronautical products; supports the Government's position that the model mapped out in the draft Regulation could provide the building blocks to meet these objectives by improving the present European safety regulation system, the key elements being that the Agency is endowed with the necessary powers and sufficient autonomy to exercise its responsibilities, to attract high quality staff and to make certification decisions efficiently and effectively; and supports the Government's intention to press for this approach in the EU.</p></blockquote></p>
