<p><i>[Relevant Documents: European Union Document No. 13572/00, relating to protection of the Communities' financial interests; the unnumbered explanatory memorandum dated 20 December 2000, submitted by H. M. Treasury on the Court of Auditors' Annual Report for 1999; and European Union Document No. 13512/00, the Eleventh Annual Report by the Commission on the Structural Funds</i> (7999).]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good morning. Before I call the Minister to make her opening statement, I remind the Committee that the quorum is three.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased that the Committee has asked for a debate on the European Court of Auditors' report on the 1999 financial year, and the European Commission's fight against fraud report for 1999. I am pleased because those two documents cover such an important subject. It is right that the Committee should show the priority that it attaches to tackling fraud and waste against the European Communities' budget by holding a debate on the documents. It might help if I make a few introductory comments before I answer questions.<br><br>
I shall start with the European Court of Auditors' annual report. I am sure that the Committee is aware that the European Court of Auditors still finds that the level of errors is too high for it to be able to give a positive statement of assurance. That is clearly unacceptable, but we need to bear in mind a number of points when considering the 1999 annual report.<br><br>
First, we must not equate error with fraud, or even with serious irregularity. I am sure that the Committee appreciates that and would not stoop to the level of the popular press, with its "£3 billion of fraud found in the EC budget!" headlines. We know that the court has found what it terms "substantive error", which is defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"a specific quantifiable error directly affecting the amount of the transactions underlying Community funds disbursed."</p></blockquote>
The majority of such cases are not fraudulent. In fact, the ECA makes it clear in its 1999 report that the bulk of errors represent such things as small overpayments to farmers and payments for expenditure that were not eligible for co-funding under complex regulations.<br><br>
Secondly, the report acknowledges that things are changing. On agricultural expenditure, for instance, the report says that
<br><blockquote><p>"over the past few years the Community has made a significant attempt at improving the control procedures by establishing the integrated administration and control system".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
On structural funds, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Commission…secured the enactment of regulation 2064/97 which provides for a greater degree of verification of costs claimed by final beneficiaries".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, in drafting the new structural funds regulation for the 2000–06 programming period, we have learned the lessons of the past and ensured that it is less complex and ambiguous and that financial control requirements are clearly set out. We must now ensure that those changes are fully implemented if we are to gain a benefit. It will take time for the effect of the changes to be felt, but I believe that we are moving in the right direction.<br><br>
Thirdly, the report covers 1999. The Prodi Commission did not take office until September 1999. From the beginning, reform has been high on that Commission's agenda. Prodi appointed Neil Kinnock as Vice-President with responsibility for administrative reform, and he immediately undertook a comprehensive review that culminated in his reform White Paper, which was published in March 2000. The Government welcomed that White Paper, which we believe is a comprehensive and far-reaching blueprint for reform. In particular, the Government welcome the three main objectives of the paper, which are to introduce a better system for setting priorities; to overhaul financial management in the Commission; and to modernise personnel policy.<br><br>
The United Kingdom has been highlighting such issues for many years. We have helped by providing information on best practice, as well as by ensuring that the Council continues to focus on the need to follow through on the reform plans. Real, fundamental reform will take time to implement, but we are pleased that the Prodi Commission has taken action quickly on several issues to underline its commitment to the reforms. It has reorganised internally to focus attention on the responsibility of operational staff, which will ensure that resources are well used and safeguarded from fraud.<br><br>
The Commission has also established a central financial service to provide advice and guidelines to operational directorates-general on fulfilling responsibilities. Such measures will replace the previous ex ante financial control system, which blurred the lines of responsibility for financial management. They are supported by the introduction of a professional internal audit service to ensure that effective financial controls are in place.<br><br>
Action has also been taken on other areas of concern to the UK, such as the code of conduct for Commissioners, which was approved at the Prodi Commission's first meeting in September 1999. There are also proposals for an advisory group on standards in public life, which will provide independent guidance on appropriate standards of behaviour at all levels of the organisations. Also, a "whistleblowers' charter" underlines the duty of all staff to report concerns about wrongdoing, and provides protection for those who use the procedures responsibly. The Government expect the proposals to be implemented as soon as the proper consultation procedures with staff and the other institutions concerned have been carried out.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0342">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
In the year under review, the most important development in the fight against fraud was the establishment of the new European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in June 1999, following an initiative by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. It will be a strong, independent body to fight fraud against the European Union budget. The new head of OLAF, Franz-Hermann Bruener, took office in March 2000. The Council and European Parliament approved extra staff for the office, bringing its full complement to 300, double that of its predecessor. Recruitment of the new staff is now under way, and the office has already been active in fighting frauds, ranging from illegal importation of bananas from Ecuador, to irregular payments to staff of the Commission delegation in Sweden.<br><br>
Today, we are debating the Commission's fight against fraud report for 1999. The Government view any level of fraud against the EC budget as a grave issue, and believe in zero tolerance of fraud and fraudsters. We must therefore view any increase of the level of reported fraud with concern. However, we must be careful about interpreting statistics. First, the report does not cover only fraud, but also "irregularity", where no intentional wrongdoing has been proven. Secondly, an increase in the level of reported fraud and irregularity may be due to improved detection or improved notification of cases by member states to the Commission. The Commission notes in its introduction that the rate of frauds and irregularities is, broadly speaking, comparable to previous years. The only significant new trend concerns structural measures, which reflects the greater efforts made by member states to inspect and detect fraud and irregularity.<br><br>
A welcome development in this year's fight against fraud report is the separate classification of fraud as opposed to irregularity. The Commission has made the distinction based on information supplied by member states. It will be necessary for the Commission to refine the system by which it categorises frauds and irregularities, in co-operation with the member states. A useful first step has been made to obtain more concrete information on the level of fraud.<br><br>
In summary, the documents are important. Many problems must be tackled, but there have also been many positive developments. Some of the initiatives have already begun to take effect, and others will take time to do so. I assure the Committee that our Government intend to play an active role in keeping the fight against fraud and waste high on the European agenda.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has dwelt at length on the reforms. Does she agree with her colleague the Secretary of State for International Development? The Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Anyone who knows anything about development knows that the EU is the worst agency in the world, the most inefficient, the least poverty-focused, the slowest, flinging money around for political gestures rather than promoting real development."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The Minister must accept that there is widespread concern over inefficiencies in the Commission. The report that we are considering today describes circumstances that are worse than those which led to the resignation of Mr. Santer. Exactly how bad does it have to get before the Minister registers an objection with the Court of Auditors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is forgetting a point that I hoped I had been at pains to emphasise in my opening remarks. The report that we are considering relates to 1999, a year in which the reforms had only just begun. In fact, they only began during the course of the year. In effect, there has not been time to tackle many of the issues raised in the report.<br><br>
I entirely agree with many of the comments of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development. I will make a few points in relation to the external aid budgets in response to the specific point to which the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) referred. On that matter, the Commission has recently adopted an ambitious reform agenda, covering programming, financial procedures, organisational staffing levels and the de-concentration of staff and financial authority to Commission delegations. There has been substantial progress in implementing the reforms already made. For example, the creation of Europaid will give a coordinated approach to planning and implementing projects. The new inter-service quality support group and the common framework will improve programming.<br><br>
There are other measures scheduled, such as the de-concentration of staff to delegations in different countries, which I have already mentioned, and which is scheduled for the year 2001–02. Together, those reforms should bring a real improvement in the quality of EU aid. The UK is monitoring their implementation closely, supporting the Commission where we think it necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lepper <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Pavilion)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister hear, on the radio this morning, a debate involving Commissioner Kinnock about the reform programme that he is introducing and reporting on? Does she agree that there seems to be some confusion in that news item over exactly to whom those reform proposals apply? There was a representative of another political party—I did not catch whether it was the Conservative party or the UK Independence party—[<i>Interruption.</i>] It was a genuine confusion on my part. I did not hear which party the person represented; it could have been either of those two. There seemed to be some confusion about whether the reforms on which Commissioner Kinnock is currently reporting apply to members or to Commissioners or to those working for the Commission. Will the Minister say more about the Kinnock report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can talk about it, but only on the basis of informal information and the coverage of the matter. I have not had the chance to study the document myself yet, and I am not sure whether it is available to us. I heard part of the news item to which my hon. Friend refers. I would be pleased to talk more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
about the matter, because the reform White Paper is a wide-ranging and comprehensive document, and it will take time to put all the proposed changes in place. Much has been done already. There has been consideration of how the financial regulation might be reformed and proposals have been made by the Commission for agreement by the member states. A code of conduct for Commissioners and Commission officials has also been introduced, and disciplinary procedures have been overhauled. There have been initiatives to encourage promotion on merit and better representation of women. I mentioned previously the publication of the "whistleblowers' charter" and the measures on senior appointments, including plans for senior officials to be subject to a system of appraisals involving outside assessors.<br><br>
One of the results that we want is a more flexible, transparent and meritocratic system of remuneration for Commission staff. We want staff to be rewarded for good performance, rather than receiving automatic increments merely for staying in their post. It is important that remuneration should consist primarily of a fair and competitive basic salary and that allowances should be linked closely to the costs incurred. We support reforms that would accomplish those goals—some fully and some less completely. In particular we expect the reforms to establish a simpler career structure, with the abolition of the false distinctions that prevent advancement on merit. We want some unjustified allowances, such as payments to secretaries for typing skills, to be abolished, and family allowances to be provided at a flat rate instead of as a percentage of salary, which benefits the best-paid most.<br><br>
Mr. Kinnock suggested in his interview this morning that many of those issues are being tackled. I hope that that will reassure my hon. Friend as it does me. I am sure that there is much work to be done on achieving the reforms, but things are certainly moving in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister persist in her bland euphemism of "substantive error" to describe the damning indictment of consistent malpractice that is contained in the Court of Auditors' report? Is not there grave evidence of fraud? Is the Minister aware that Members of the European Parliament will summon two senior European Commission officials to explain their actions in a subsidies fraud investigation? I refer to Mr. Legras and Mr. Jean-Louis Dewost. Is she aware that the fine of 17.6 million euros against the Fléchard company has been reduced to 3 million euros? Was that at the behest of the French Government? Is the Minister aware that, in addition to the two officials of the European Commission whom I have mentioned, another 10 are to be summoned by Members of the European Parliament before they are prepared to sign off the 1999 budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, the Government believe that any level of fraud against the EC budget is unacceptable. We continue to work with the Commission and member states to fight fraud. There
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
must be zero tolerance of fraudsters. It is right that inquiries should be carried out to ensure that no undue influence has been exerted, in response to the points that the hon. Gentleman made. The Government are against political pressure being applied to the Commission as it has been suggested may have happened. However, general reforms will help. Clearer guidelines on how financial corrections—fines— should be applied are important. The reform of the career system that has been proposed by Mr. Kinnock emphasises promotion on merit rather than the influence of member states, as I have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Eileen Gordon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Romford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that fraud is intolerable. I welcome the Government's commitment to zero tolerance of fraud. After all, the law-abiding citizens of the European Union must pay for the fraud in the end.<br><br>
What is the United Kingdom doing to improve its financial management of European Union funds? What measures has it taken to improve prevention, with respect to the administration of EU funds in the UK?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have done several things, at several levels. We can make good progress in a variety of ways. One is by tackling issues at the European level of treaties and proposals. For example, the Amsterdam treaty supported the previous Government's intergovernmental conference proposals when it gave the European Court of Auditors the right of recourse to the European Court of Justice to protect its prerogatives and when it clarified the ECA's right of access to carry out audit work. Things can be done at that level, but we should also use the various councils and other on-going European forums to debate such topics.<br><br>
My hon. Friend, who touched on the subject, will be keen to hear that we have done much to improve our management of EU funds. The Department of Trade and Industry has clarified the definitions of fraud and irregularity, and has provided additional guidance to other Departments on reporting irregularities. Following another ECA recommendation, the DTI also circulates quarterly lists of the irregularities that are reported to other Departments for checking.<br><br>
The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has issued guidance to all Government offices about carrying out the required check of 5 per cent, of all expenditure of structural fund moneys; and suspected irregularities in the European social fund are reported to the Department for Education and Employment specialist verification and audit section—the VAS. Suspected fraud cases are referred by the VAS to the Department's special investigation unit. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has introduced a control plan for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, which clarifies monitoring procedures and introduces new checks that are based on risk analysis.<br><br>
It is important that member states should take responsibility for their expenditure; much EU expenditure is being spent by member states and they should be responsible for it. We have done much to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
ensure that that happens, and we are taking further steps in the European arena to ensure better fraud prevention in the UK's administration of EU funds. For example, we have introduced interest charges on customs debts to encourage early repayment; we are implementing a civil penalty regime for customs duty evasion and other regulatory offences; and all anti-fraud customs activities are now co-ordinated within the Department. UK customs has developed close cooperation with the customs authorities of eight other member states, and we expect to expand that network. We have also signed a bilateral memorandum of understanding with France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.<br><br>
The Department for Education and Employment held a seminar on fraud for representatives of the Government offices and of the devolved Administrations. A great deal of work is in hand, but it is incumbent on us as a significant player in Europe to ensure that other member states take similar action. It is a serious matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, in her last reply, said that much of that expenditure is the responsibility of member states. I believe that it is in the order of 80 per cent. Although we should not neglect the other 20 per cent., the management of the 80 per cent, is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. I, too, believe that it is about 80 per cent., but I do not have the exact figure. It is important that those responsibilities should be properly discharged. The EU must take some responsibility for the implementation of the budget under the treaty, and the Commission is given discharge ultimately by the European Parliament. It is not for the Commission to dodge those responsibilities, but it is ultimately for member states to monitor their expenditure correctly. We have done more to ensure that they must co-operate with the Commission, so that the parts of the budget for which they are responsible are administered under the principles of sound financial management. One of the relevant initiatives is SEM 2000, the sound and efficient management initiative, which is designed to strengthen such matters across member states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As one would expect, having heard the comments made by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Sir R. Whitney), the report notes that the bulk of the errors occur in the main expenditure programme managed by the public authorities in member states, especially small overpayments to farmers. The 1995 convention on the protection of the communities' financial interests, which the United Kingdom was among the first countries to ratify, has still not been ratified by all our EU partners. What steps is the UK taking to encourage our partners to strengthen the relevant activities, especially in terms of ratifying that convention?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. I should touch on agriculture, which he mentioned, as I did not do so earlier. It is important to recognise that we are concerned about irregularities in expenditure in relation to the common agricultural policy. In the UK, we have taken measures to tackle levels of agricultural irregularity, which include the continued development of risk analysis so that we can identify problem areas, greater publicity to ensure that people are aware of controls and ensuring that all targets for carrying out inspections are met. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has introduced a control plan to clarify its monitoring procedures and to implement new checks, based on the risk analysis.<br><br>
We must consider the UK's financial management of EU funds. With regard to the Commission's actions in future, the Government do not believe that the way ahead requires a Eurojust, corpus juris proposal. The proper way to proceed is the establishment of a new anti-fraud office with a strong independent director, as has been done. That director should have the power to begin investigations on his own initiative and, as announced, should have immediate access to the Commission and other EU institutions.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) will know, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister called for root-and-branch reform of the Commission in March 1999. That relates to the year that we are talking about. We circulated several suggestions to the Commission about how it might proceed with the issues. Many of our ideas were incorporated into the Commission reform White Paper, which was published in March. At Cologne and Helsinki, the European Council reiterated its support for the reform process. We have offered advice and experience based on meetings between officials, and we continue to ensure that we are engaged with the developments in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the part of the Minister's reply on the independence of the anti-fraud committee. She described OLAF, which replaces UCLAF, as independent in her opening remarks, but use of that word raises an eyebrow on the Conservative Benches. The body still has the same staff and offices, carries out the same practices and reports to an EU Commissioner. Does the Minister agree that OLAF is not that independent? We welcome what she said about the need for a genuinely independent anti-fraud office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We believe that the OLAF arrangements are right, and have supported them from the start. We were instrumental in the establishment of a strong, independent anti-fraud office. OLAF works in co-operation with the member states and does good work to fight fraud, with a number of major investigations successfully carried out. It is important that OLAF is perceived as effective and independent. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about that. The arrangements that set up the office have ensured its independence, including the appointment of a new head of the office.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
One of the strengths of OLAF, which the hon. Gentleman may wish to reflect on in comparison with its predecessor UCLAF, is a strong independent director, who was appointed after consultation with the Council and the European Parliament, and who has statutory protection from dismissal. The director is debarred from taking or seeking instruction from any Government or Community institution, so the position enjoys a strong degree of protection. He is also able to bring actions against the Commission before the European Court of Justice if his independence is threatened in any way.<br><br>
The director is also able to open investigations on his own initiative, as I have mentioned. He has immediate and unannounced access to buildings and documents. He is able to draw up reports, including recommendations for follow-up. The institutions will have to report to him on whether follow-up recommendations have been implemented. He reports regularly to the Council and the European Parliament, has appeared before both on several occasions, and is able to alert them if the office's reports are not being acted upon.<br><br>
There is a supervisory committee attached to OLAF, which reinforces the independence of the office. Its members were appointed by common accord between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. The office will be a strong force in the fight against fraud. However, I emphasise again that OLAF was still being set up during the period that we are discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being bland to the point of passivity when she says that fraud in the agricultural sector merely causes concern, and that there is nothing to worry about in the UK in that regard. It may be the case that there is nothing to worry about in the UK, but what is she going to do about fraud on the continent? Does she realise that the Commission inspectors discovered last summer that organised criminals had been producing adulterated butter containing chemical additives and beef by-products normally used only in cosmetics, and had marketed it with the help of Italian, French and Belgian firms, one of which is Fléchard? Is she also aware that MEPs are looking into irregularities in flax subsidies in Spain, and may not sign off the 1999 budget until that matter is cleared up? If the MEPs are dissatisfied, and refuse to sign off the 1999 budget, will the Minister back them, or will she back Prodi the crony?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I do not recognise some of the descriptions that the hon. Gentleman uses. The common agricultural policy has been the subject of improvements and there have been reforms to the CAP itself. I will attempt to give the hon. Gentleman some comfort, as he is apparently feeling discomfited for reasons that, for the moment, elude me. Those improvements followed reforms undertaken in 1992, and they have been built on. They reduce the reliance on export refunds and market support measures. Those are the areas in which fraud is most common.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
The report under discussion refers to 1999. As I said, that is before the new Commission was in place. The UK has supported measures to reduce fraud in the EU budget, and will continue to do so. That includes further simplification of CAP regulations, which will help to reduce simple errors that are often classified as irregularities. The level of errors remains too high, and I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that. I thought that I had emphasised that in my remarks. We must tackle those errors and make the right distinctions between fraud and other kinds of error, stemming from various irregularities. The UK has strongly supported the Commission's action on several agricultural issues, and I fail to see how the hon. Gentleman can make a complaint about the way in which we have prosecuted our case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend welcome the fact that the Commission report shows that serious work has been done to discourage tobacco and alcohol smuggling, which we would all agree is a significant problem in Britain? Will she encourage our partners to continue to accelerate work on the matter, to try to minimise the problem that results in such large losses to the Exchequer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I missed my hon. Friend's opening words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wondered whether my hon. Friend welcomes the fact that the Commission's report shows that serious work is being done on tracking and eliminating evasion of excise duties for tobacco and alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed I do. I share my hon. Friend's concern. We are unhappy about the continued tobacco subsidies, and we continue to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do nothing about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We continue to try to bring about change. The hon. Gentleman says that we have done nothing. I think that tobacco subsidies have been established since 1973.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And they have not stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is as easy as the hon. Gentleman alleges to bring about change in this matter, it is a mystery why 18 years of Conservative Governments did not produce results that were so readily to be had.<br><br>
I may have confused the hon. Member for Croydon, South earlier on one point. The United Kingdom supports Eurojust; I am not sure whether I made that clear. We do not support a common public prosecutor on a European level.<br><br>
As to agriculture, which was among the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, we have brought about positive development in the management of the relevant budget. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee know which aspects of agriculture give rise to issues that need to be dealt with, but we have made good progress on which to build in tightening up practices.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already been asked about the 1995 convention on the protection of the Community's financial interests, but a parallel convention deals with corruption in connection with the budget, and that has been ratified by only one state. Which state is that?<br><br>
Further to the point that was made about tobacco smuggling, the Minister will know that a far bigger problem is the smuggling of fuel across the land frontier of the United Kingdom. I assume that if there were the same incentive to smuggle fuel on the continent of Europe across land frontiers, such smuggling would be on a large scale. How has that been dealt with on the continent, while we have not been able to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to furnish me with evidence on the latter point I shall be happy to take it up. I am not aware of any details of such a problem—certainly not from the 1999 report.<br><br>
I shall need to write to the hon. Gentleman to tell him which member state has ratified the convention. I shall write to him about the fuel question as well, but should be interested to receive any evidence that he has.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Probity in the financial markets is of course particularly important to Britain, with its substantial invisible exports in that context. Will my hon. Friend explain the improvements that have been made with respect to financial regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The United Kingdom has taken a great interest in that subject and it is important to maintain our standing in that respect. The current financial regulation is an unwieldy, complex and ambiguous document, partly because of several ad hoc revisions in order to deal with individual problems. As a result, in 1997, the European Court of Auditors proposed a complete recasting exercise, which is now in progress. The Commission presented a proposal in October 2000 for a clearer and less ambiguous document. The key change concerns the modernisation of the financial control system, with clearer roles and responsibilities for those involved in financial transactions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend will be interested to know that the new regulation makes it clear that those who make operational decisions must bear responsibility for ensuring that money is properly controlled and well spent. Perhaps that should be taken for granted in all such systems, but it has not been in the past and it is now a core principle of the new regulations. The system is, obviously, similar to the one with which we are familiar here, and we fully support the principles that have been relied on.<br><br>
We also want the new regulation to lead to high-quality objective setting and evaluation, as part of the budgetary process. The Commission has made related proposals on activity-based budgeting, which will be important in that regard. We will work hard to ensure that the relevant issues form a key part of the new regulation. We shall encourage the Council to accord the highest priority to the consideration of the Commission's proposal, to avoid unnecessary delay.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister clarified matters with respect to Eurojust. Is she aware that it is holding its first meeting tomorrow, in the Council of Ministers building, and that the Belgians, who will hold the presidency in the second part of this year, have said that a full version of Eurojust will be a priority of their presidency? Does the Minister think that there can be a full version without a single prosecutor for Europe, as titular head or president of the organisation? How will it be able to work effectively without a corpus juris, to which she has declared her opposition? Will Eurojust's progress in combating cross-border fraud be reported to European Standing Committee B?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government do not believe that a European public prosecutor is either a necessary or a very practicable option. We have supported the idea of close links between OLAF and Eurojust to ensure that OLAF can refer the appropriate fraud cases to Eurojust. We think that that is more likely than a Euro-prosecutor to be effective in tackling EC budget fraud.<br><br>
The appointment of a European public prosecutor would involve major changes in laws and procedures, and we think that it would be impracticable to superimpose a corpus juris on the UK legal system. The European public prosecutor would not be fully accountable. It is hard to see how real accountability could be built into the arrangement. Significant practical difficulties would be involved.<br><br>
We do not think that the proposal would provide a coherent approach to instances of fraud in the EC budget involving non-EU as well as EU jurisdictions. We do not think that it would help in protecting the EC budget. It is important to leave time for Eurojust to get under way.<br><br>
The Commission has a problem with lack of action by member states in the absence of legal instruments on trans-national frauds. The corpus juris would introduce an autonomous criminal code for investigation, prosecution and punishment relating to fraud and other crimes against the Community's finances. It would also involve major changes in laws and procedures.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the first meeting of the interim Eurojust body took place this week. I am pleased that the Belgians intend to act on the full Eurojust, but we cannot yet expect great improvements, as it is merely at its inception. However, we have considerable hopes for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I follow up the Minister's interesting elucidations and ask her whether Her Majesty's Government will veto the imposition of a corpus juris and the initiation of a single prosecutor for Europe? Do Her Majesty's Government have the powers to exercise such a veto if such proposals are made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have already told the hon. Gentleman, we do not support the proposals and will prosecute our case, if I may use that metaphor, in the

EU as we best see fit, to maintain the position that we have long held. I will need to write to the hon. Gentleman about a veto.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13572/00, Protecting the Communities' Financial Interests— the fight against fraud: Commission's Annual Report 1999; and the unnumbered explanatory memorandum dated 20th December 2000 submitted by HM Treasury relating to the Court of Auditors' annual report for 1999; and supports the Government's continuing efforts to promote and support measures to improve financial management and fight fraud against the EU budget.— [<i>Miss Melanie Johnson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.17 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several times, the Minister has pointed out that we are debating the Court of Auditors' report for 1999, and that Mr. Prodi did not take over as president of the Commission until autumn 1999, so blame should be attached not to him but to Mr. Santer. I think that that summarises her position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made no comments about Mr. Santer. However, we in the UK Government made our position on the change clear at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By implication, the Minister seeks to distinguish between the old regime and the new by pointing out that the new regime began in the autumn. I make no other point than that.<br><br>
The 1999 report is pretty damning. It is an indictment of the old practices of the Commission. The Court of Auditors found that lucrative farm subsidies were consistently misallocated, aid payments were barely monitored and millions of pounds were spent on misguided projects. The Minister said that that was not fraud but error, but the definition of error is stretched somewhat when one starts to dig into the 480 pages that make up the catalogue of mistakes, misunderstandings and fraud about which the Commission has been unable or unwilling to do anything.<br><br>
The auditors refused to state the exact sums squandered, but one of the report's authors is reported to have said that the figure was between 5.5 and 7 per cent, of the Commission's budget of £60 billion. That is an even higher level of waste than that which led to the downfall of Mr. Santer, so by any stretch of the imagination, it is a damning report. Frankly, for the Minister to invite the Committee to take note of it is a pretty tame response to what is probably the worst report that has ever come out of the European Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman's apocalyptic remarks escalate further, I would like to draw his attention to the Commission's estimates of the percentage of the budget actually affected by fraud, on pages 27 and 28 of the report, which overall hovers around the 1 per cent. mark. Does he feel that that justifies the rhetoric that he is deploying?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I am citing the report. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman is citing the Commission, of which one is tempted to say, "They would say that, wouldn't they?" Thirdly, one can turn to the report of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
European Parliament, a more independent body, by the rapporteur, Mr. Freddy Blak, who says on page 11 that he suspects that the figure for 1999 is at least 5 per cent. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but my evidence rather outweighs his.<br><br>
The Court of Auditors report goes on to state that subsidy payments made to farmers across the European Union were found to be error-ridden and chronically vulnerable to fraud. It found that farmers have "overdeclared either surface area"—in Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal—
<br><blockquote><p>"or the number of head of livestock".</p></blockquote>
Other bogus payments were made for non-existent storage costs, and special beef premiums were given to German farmers who provided no proof that they had slaughtered any cattle.<br><br>
One of the more bizarre diversions of EU money took place in Greece. Last year, £35 million intended as farm subsidies was used instead to set up an insurance fund for farm workers and pay the administrative costs of farmers' unions. The list goes on. I assure the Committee that it is quite entertaining. I shall return to the report of the European Parliament by Mr. Freddy Blak, and pluck out of it some further examples of mishandling.<br><br>
The Commission has an office in Stockholm, where the chauffeur used to take the dogs for walks, and nonexistent staff were hired. The person who ran the Stockholm office returned to the Commission and was promoted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall just finish what I am saying.<br><br>
In Washington, the cost of renovating the Commission's offices was greater than the cost of acquiring them. There is a long list of errors in which a truly independent anti-fraud office could find much scope for investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely essential that we root out fraud wherever it occurs, but I was intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's reference to the civil servant taking the dogs for a walk in Stockholm. When I was a student in Cardiff in the early 1980s, I seem to remember a similar, substantiated allegation about the then Conservative Secretary of State for Wales. We need context for our debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right, and I would not endorse that abuse either. The Minister has made up her mind that she will not criticise the report. However, I use the examples to draw attention to the fact that there is a lot going on underneath the surface.<br><br>
I said that I would divide my speech into two parts. The second part concerns the measures that have been put in place and those that will be put in place. Under questioning from Conservative Members, the Minister repeatedly said that the present European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, was independent. I pointed out that it was not that independent, because it had the same staff and engaged in the same practices, reporting to the Commission. However, the Minister reiterated that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
is independent. If so, why does Commissioner Kinnock's White Paper talk about the need for an independent internal audit service? If it is independent, why reform it? If it ain't broke, why are we trying to fix it? Is the Minister saying that the present system is genuinely independent, or that it is not independent and that she supports Mr. Kinnock's proposals for an independent auditor?<br><br>
The Minister is probably aware that the European Parliament appointed a surveillance committee of five experts, including the Secretary-General of Interpol and the French criminal justice specialist Mireille Delmas-Marty. Last year, and 18 months after Mr. Prodi came to office, it published a damning report. It makes it clear that the new anti-fraud office created by the EU to root out corruption in Brussels is no better than its predecessor and that it has failed to break free from political control. A year and a half after the collapse of the Santer Commission, little seems to have changed. EU officials have yet to fulfil their promises to overhaul the investigative machinery so that abuses can be detected earlier.<br><br>
The report says that there has been no appreciable improvement in procedures to stop the misappropriation of funds within EU institutions, concluding that the new anti-fraud office, known by the French acronym of OLAF, is so disorganised that sensitive investigations are compromised. The report described management failure as alarming, especially as the introduction of the euro and the enlargement of the EU will offer criminals new opportunities to commit fraud. We want fraud investigation to be treated as a serious business, but we have been given OLAF, which is nothing more than a bad joke. It would be better to start again.<br><br>
As I pointed out earlier, OLAF reports to Budget Commissioner Mr. Michaele Schreyer, a German Green who has been criticised for his weak administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a funny feeling that the Minister is about to tell me that the Commissioner has changed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Commissioner is female.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say whether the Commissioner was male or female.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said, "Mr".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I was speaking generically.<br><br>
Mr. Bosch, the vice-chairman of the European Parliament's budgetary control committee, said that OLAF was being used as a shunting yard for Commission officials and warned that the European Parliament would consider blocking funds unless the old practices were stamped out. Whichever way the Minister looks it, we must consider the proposals seriously.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
I shall make a few suggestions on how the Minister could step up the pressure on the Commission. We want a genuinely independent anti-fraud office. She and I can at least agree on that. We want a body equivalent to the Public Accounts Committee; perhaps the European parliamentary budgetary control committee should be strengthened and allowed to call for witnesses and papers. The European Parliament should be given the power to dismiss Commissioners for maladministration. We want a register of interests for Commissioners, and we want to prevent them making personal appointments.<br><br>
In conclusion, the situation is far from perfect. Much needs to be done. The Minister has invited us to take note of the document. I believe that it is too tame, but I shall leave it to the members of the Committee to decide how to react to that. The Minister also asked us to support the Government's continuing efforts to promote and support measures to improve financial management and fight EU fraud. Those are fine words and we cannot disagree with them, as far as they go. However, if the independent surveillance committee is to be taken seriously, it is clear that the measures in question are not up to scratch.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As someone who is keen on Britain's positive relationship with our European partners, and who believes that we must work hard to get the European Union to work better—and, above all, to be seen by our constituents to work better—I am conscious of the fact that, year by year, we have the same debate about the inadequacies of the control procedures in the Commission and throughout the European Union. There can be no doubt that we must go on fighting waste and extravagance wherever they are found. We all, day by day, come across examples of fraud or waste.<br><br>
It is suggested in the newspaper today in a piece about Commissioner Kinnock that
<br><blockquote><p>"Commission secretaries claim a £1,100 annual typing allowance, although typewriters vanished a decade ago."</p></blockquote>
That is not, of course, fraud, but it is a criminal waste of European taxpayers' money and, even more importantly, it does political damage to the concept of the European Union. There can be no division in the Committee or the House about the need to improve procedures.<br><br>
However, it is important to keep matters in perspective. As the Minister said in her opening remarks, the European Union has many critics. Mr. Christopher Booker, for example, has a one-man campaign that is widely followed by those who want to find evidence of EU weakness or malpractice. The Committee owes it to itself and the House to keep the issue in careful perspective. That means that we should recognise that any large organisation, particularly an international one, will have faults and flaws that are difficult to remove entirely, because of the multifaceted international nature of the institution. That does not mean that we should rest and say that nothing can be done. We must keep striving for improvements. However, we must understand the difficulty of the job.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
A few years ago, I was a member of a small group of Members of Parliament and Members of the European Parliament who were invited to see the fraud control procedures of the European Union. We were given a three or four-hour session with the then head of UCLAF, and we came away impressed with him and sympathetic to what he was doing. A major element in the task that confronted him was something that I raised with the Minister earlier: something like 80 per cent, of Government expenditure is under the control of member states and cannot be seriously investigated by the European institution concerned, by whatever name it might go in that month. That is a difficulty that the Committee and member states should consider.<br><br>
The head of UCLAF of course found great differences in the accessibility of member states' mechanisms to investigation by UCLAF. Even within member states there were differences. We were all, I think, chagrined by what we were told about our own country, which we like to consider as a shining light showing how public finances should be conducted—as I believe it is. The head of UCLAF informed our little group that he found significant differences between certain Government Departments. We believed that that point should have been considered carefully.<br><br>
The member states' inviolability from the investigation raises sensitive and crucial issues of sovereignty and independence. We are all aware of them, my party acutely so. We must be careful and measured in our attacks on the inefficacy of UCLAF or its successor in considering sovereignty. I hope that we can find mechanisms to shed more light and bring more transparency. We shall not find such a way forward unless we approach the issue in a positive and constructive spirit.</span></p>
<p>11.36 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's motion anodyne beyond measure. I have said before that righteous indignation has a role in politics. If we lose our sense of conscience, we betray our constituents and are not worthy of the role that we seek to fulfil. We all remember Bernard Connolly's book, "The Rotten Heart of Europe". Every year, we have a testimony to its subject in the Court of Auditors' report. In this country, such a catalogue of malfeasance would rightly not be tolerated, and we would not vote to allocate supplies in cases of established malpractice. In Europe, matters are different. As our country has virtually required the status of a subject satrapy, we are impotent to do anything about it.<br><br>
The motion is bland and uncritical. It expresses hopes for the future, but we all know from our bitter experience of many years that they will not be realised. Our electors deserve better. Even if we voted to take no note of the motion, doing so would have no effect whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that the fraud and irregularity highlighted in the report is unique to the European Commission, as opposed to governmental activities in this country. Will he ponder on the fact that the level of fraud identified year on year by the Court of Auditors is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
broadly similar to that identified, for example, in the housing benefit budget in this country? I do not minimise the importance of the issue in terms of our Government's expenditure or European expenditure, but we need a sense of context that his comments have so far not had.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The important difference is that our Public Accounts Committee has a role answerable to elected representatives who put pressure on Her Majesty's Government to try to rectify unsatisfactory situations. The Labour Government have been full of rhetoric about the need to eliminate housing benefit fraud and other abuses of the social security system. We always support them in such endeavours. Every now and again, the Secretary of State for Social Security gives evidence to the House of an improvement in the situation. Although we are not entirely happy, a degree of reassurance can be provided to Members; but no reassurance can be gained from the succession of Court of Auditors' reports, which we consider in a pantomime procedure that has no material effect.<br><br>
The Minister was somewhat dismissive of the extent of fraud in the agricultural sector, but it is institutionalised. I have not heard of the Government having to hire remote sensing satellites to investigate the misappropriation of agricultural funding by British farmers, but that goes on on the continent. We know that unless such a practice is followed, claims will be made for non-existent vineyards, olive groves and the like. It is utterly unsatisfactory and grotesque, particularly so as our farmers are going to the wall and suffering so much at present.<br><br>
As I said, we should reform our practices. We should at least withhold the British contribution to the extent of fraud for which we have evidence. We should also have the guts to stand up against evil. For example, the Minister referred to the European subsidy for tobacco growing. That subsidy, provided by British taxpayers at the behest of the European Union, promotes morbidity, early death, bereavement and suffering. It is morally appalling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rammell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make the same point that I make whenever the hon. Gentleman raises that issue. Can he explain why Conservative Members of the European Parliament specifically voted against ending those tobacco subsidies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for Members of the European Parliament, be they members of my party or of any other party—any more than Members of the European Parliament can speak for the hon. Gentleman or for myself. They are answerable to their consciences. I would find it impossible to answer for my own conscience were I not to fight against that manifest abuse of European taxpayers' money.<br><br>
The fault lies with the system and the automaticity of revenue gathering inherent in the European Union. The EU automatically receives a proportion of VAT receipts from member states and an own resources contribution based on their respective gross national products. No mechanism exists to allow elected representatives to vote a supply and then, if it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
misused, to withhold it. That is what is needed. Until it happens, I doubt whether we shall see an improvement, because the EU fraudbusters are themselves under investigation for malpractice. That is a deeply worrying state of affairs.<br><br>
To conclude, I revert to the original point that I made to the Minister. We are impotent in that field; we prove it year after year. At least the Members of the European Parliament purport to have a role in protecting the United Kingdom's interests. Can the Government say without equivocation that, if the European Parliament decides not to sign off the 1999 budget, they will support the European Parliament against the Commission? Unless they speak for the elected representatives, the electorate will have little confidence in the Government's true determination to eradicate fraud in the EU.</span></p>
<p>11.44 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Melanie Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, in answer to some of the hon. Gentleman's closing remarks, it is surprising to hear such a counsel of despair. That is why no one believes that the Opposition are fit to govern in the UK or to take a lead on behalf of the UK in Europe. The counsel that the hon. Gentleman has offered us this morning is neither effective, nor, in some cases, is it possible, and it will not deal with the issues that he claims he is keen to deal with. I am shocked at the general tone and the hopelessness of his remarks. He remarked on the fact that we all have responsibilities here, and that we must deserve the posts that we hold, and be seen to be taking action. In his remarks, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is surely abrogating his responsibilities and those of his party.<br><br>
I turn to the remarks of the hon. Member for Croydon, South, who, first of all, introduced a substantial element of hearsay on the question of errors. It will not surprise him to learn that I cannot comment on hearsay. We believe that the error rate is similar to that of previous years, and the court states, officially, in the introduction to the report, that the bulk of errors
<br><blockquote><p>"concern such matters as small overpayments to farmers".</p></blockquote>
That includes a few overpayments to UK farmers. I entirely support the wise counsel of my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell), who suggests that context is important in all these matters. The court states that the errors consist of small instances such as overpayments, not major fraud scandals, and it also states that it supports the reform programme. The hon. Member for Croydon, South is again giving a partial and limited version of the story. It is not worth dwelling on the Swedish report. The hon. Gentleman may have found it amusing, but the fact is that there has been a thorough internal investigation and a report has been sent to the Swedish judicial authorities, which is the appropriate way to deal with such matters.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of how the European Anti-Fraud Office can achieve anything from within the Commission. The Government believe
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
that an office within the Commission is the right approach, for several reasons. I still maintain that the office is independent, and I gave a list of reasons why we can be confident of its independence, and went through them one by one. I do not propose to repeat that list for the Committee's benefit. The Commission has responsibility, under the treaty, for budget execution, and that responsibility must include instituting effective fraud prevention procedures. We would expect Government Departments to follow up allegations of fraud, and to decide whether disciplinary action should be taken or whether the prosecuting authorities should be involved, and we should expect the Commission to do the same. There is no difference; there is a definite parallel.<br><br>
Basing the fraud office within the Commission is the right approach, because an office of this sort needs to understand the organisation that it is investigating. It should be on the inside, with access to information on what is going on in the organisation. Past experience bears that out. UCLAF investigated all the fraud allegations that featured in the so-called wise men's report. However, the previous arrangements were weak. I agree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South that they were unsatisfactory, but much of the period that we are discussing is covered by the transition from the previous arrangements to the new arrangements, as I have repeatedly emphasised.<br><br>
The arrangements were weak because UCLAF had no responsibility for recommending follow-up and no mechanism to ensure that the right course of action was taken as a result of those recommendations. As I said before, OLAF will have the ability to make recommendations on follow-up, institutions will have to report on whether those recommendations are carried out, and the director will be able to report on that to the Council and to the European Parliament. The terms of the director's appointment emphasise his independence, as I outlined previously. For all those reasons, a sea change has taken place in the arrangements, with the change from UCLAF to OLAF. The 1999 report cannot reflect the effects because it deals with a period too early in the process.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the supervisory committee's report and commented that it was critical. We welcomed the report. The committee was established to ensure that the office was effective and independent of the Commission. The report simply shows that it is doing its job. The Council and the European Parliament agreed that the new office should have 150 new posts. That means that there will be double the number of fraud investigators that were available to UCLAF. The new head is ensuring that he recruits the right people to do the jobs. It is inevitable that it will take time to recruit the people, but the Government continue to press for the office to be fully staffed as soon as possible. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is important that the right people should be recruited, rather than that posts should simply be filled.<br><br>
The point about Commissioner Kinnock's request for an independent internal audit service has been misinterpreted by the hon. Gentleman. There is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
difference between internal audit and fraud investigation, which I am sure that he will accept. Internal auditors support the management in ensuring that internal controls exist to control moneys. They must be independent of the staff making payments. External auditors such as the ECA provide independent assurance of what is happening. However, they are watchdogs, not bloodhounds. The fraud investigators such as OLAF are responsible for detecting and investigating fraud. The elements of the system work well together. The distinctions between the roles and the way in which they fit together need to be understood.<br><br>
As to what was said about a structure akin to that of the Public Accounts Committee, the latter body has a valuable role in the United Kingdom, as I believe all Members of this House accept. However, there is of course a difference in institutional structure between the United Kingdom and the European Union. We should study the difference in trying to decide whether simple parallels are transferable, or whether we need a more sophisticated approach to designing the right structure for the EU.<br><br>
The European Parliament is part of the budgetary authority in the European Union. It makes spending decisions that significantly affect financial management. It spends significant amounts of money itself. That is a key difference. The ECA has often investigated and found problems in financial management. We cannot read across directly from the United Kingdom to the EU system. They are fundamentally different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is making an important point in her typically calm and deliberative way, which we all appreciate, but is not that very difference the heart of the problem? In our national parliamentary institution we, the elected representatives, vote the funds and directly influence how the Government use them. The Government are in turn answerable to us, and we to our electors. In the European Union the funds come in automatically and there is no effective control over the way in which they are spent. Will the Minister abandon the usual bland approach to the matter and tell the Committee what institutional changes she and the Government want, to rectify matters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had spent much of the morning explaining how we consider continuing reform to be necessary, and how we judge the present reforms to be making a substantial difference to the previous system—which was in operation in 1999 and which we have been discussing. The hon. Gentleman makes a valuable point, with which I agree, about the key differences between the EU Parliament and the UK Parliament. Those differences are at the heart of the case that I was making. That is why a simple translation of one set of arrangements to a different set is not appropriate. I agree that the PAC plays a valuable role in the UK, but we cannot translate it into EU structures and expect it to have the same value. OLAF gives the right structural answer to tackling fraud effectively in the EU.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
The hon. Member for Wycombe made a point about investigation. The treaty gives the ECA powers to audit EU moneys, including investigating the Administrations of member states and going down to the level of the final beneficiary. The UK co-operates fully with ECA requirements. I agree with the hon. Gentleman, who said that we needed to see matters in a wider context. It is important to recognise what needs to be, has been and is being done. OLAF has powers to investigate fraud in member states, and regulations on on-the-spot checks cover the issue.<br><br>
A question was raised about tobacco by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I emphasised the fact that I thought that the subsidies had been in place since 1973. The hon. Gentleman said that it would be easy to do something about them. If so, the Conservatives had 18 years in which that was the case but, strangely, nothing happened. The regime, as amended in 1998, requires the Commission to submit a report on its functioning before 1 April 2002.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be cheered by the news that we plan to use the report as the basis for further pressing our long-term objective of progressive disengagement from the regime. There are eight producer member states, so reform of the regime will need to be handled carefully. We strongly disapprove of it, but it is already in place. We want an end to it for exactly the reasons that he gave, which were health, cost and control.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that we might withhold the UK contribution instead, as a result of concern about levels of fraud and inconsistencies. Minor errors—failure to take action in line with complex regulations—are more the cause of problems than outright fraud is. The hon. Gentleman knows that we could not follow his suggestion, as to do so would be illegal. The previous Government signed treaties that legally oblige us to pay. That is why they never withheld the contribution.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that the UK should join the European Parliament in refusing discharge. The Council's approach in the past has been based on the reasoning that we should help the Commission to improve, rather than simply considering its failures, especially in the context that we have been discussing today. The arrangements have changed substantially, as has, we believe, effectiveness since the relevant period in 1999. The blame culture could be taken too far, although we were by no means complacent about how matters stood in 1999. The right way forward is to be aware that the fault lies more widely than with only the Commission, and that the Commission can be made more effective.<br><br>
The European Parliament alone has the power to censure the Commission. That power was given to it by the treaty and ratified by all member states. Our future position is likely to reflect the position that we have taken in the past.<br><br>
I am grateful to hon. Members for their contributions to our debate, and I ask them to support the motion.</span></p>
