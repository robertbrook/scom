	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ms Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss a policy that is of great importance to public as well as to animal health. The topic has caused significant and justified media and political interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that we are dealing with a fast-moving situation, as a number of different proposals have emanated from the European Commission and several discussions have taken place in the Agriculture and Health Councils. That fast-moving situation also reflects the fact that many countries in the European Union that formerly thought that they had no cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy have discovered that they do and want to respond to them in different ways. The situation poses a challenge for the scrutiny Committees and—I appeal for sympathy from Committee members here—for Ministers. We must cope with the different European Commission and European Union proposals and ensure that we continue to consult our own industry and interest groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that political agreement on the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy proposal was reached before Christmas in the Agriculture Council. In exceptional circumstances, my right hon. Friend the Minister agreed to a common position before the proposal was discussed by the Committee. I apologise for that situation, but hon. Members know that the United Kingdom secured points of crucial national interest during the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain provisions, particularly the alternative ones in the proposal, were especially significant for the UK industry and recognised the importance and effectiveness of the controls that have already been put in place in the UK. My right hon. Friend felt that he risked losing those points if he was unable fully to support the policy on 19 December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe, therefore, that the circumstances were exceptional and I hope that the Committee understands the need for an exceptional change in procedure. In such fast-moving situations, the Government often need to judge whether proposals offer the UK a special benefit or are in our overriding interest. That is how my right hon. Friend interpreted the situation in the Council meeting on 19 December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation is complicated by the fact that, as well as the TSE proposal under consideration today, the Committee was sent information about some of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
proposed wider feed measures only in the past few days. The Committee is also due to consider the animal waste directive, which has a bearing on the issue. Many proposals are complex and require consideration. The Government are therefore willing to appear again before the Committee, if it so wishes, to examine those and related measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TSE regulation is lengthy and complex, so I shall outline the main areas that it covers. It aims to control and eradicate all transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, concentrating particularly on BSE and scrapie. It sets out controls and procedures for animals suspected of being infected with a TSE and for those confirmed as being infected. Suspected and confirmed cases must be notified to the authorities. If a BSE case is confirmed, animals at risk must be restricted and the whole herd destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK, however, does not expect to have to slaughter the whole herd following a confirmed case. We expect to be able to use—we have had reassurance about this—the alternative option provision, which I referred to as a factor that enabled my right hon. Friend to approve the regulation in December. That recognises that we already have in place measures equivalent to those in the proposal, including culling cattle over 30 months old and, since 1996, an effective feed ban. The international animal health organisation, the OIE, has already judged the UK's measures to be equivalent to whole-herd slaughter. As hon. Members will understand, the alternative option that we were able to secure is a crucial provision for the UK and has been a key point for the Government in discussions on the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals on feed affect ruminants, farmed animals and mammals, depending on the measure. Specified risk material from ruminants is defined and the disposal and movement of it is subject to controls. The trading of live animals, embryos and ova is regulated. The production and trading of certain animal products is restricted and, in some cases, prohibited. There is also a requirement for those involved in keeping, handling and caring for animals to be properly educated in the clinical signs of TSEs. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction between scrapie and BSE is made clear throughout the proposal. However, there are requirements that would have to be followed if BSE were to be discovered in sheep or goats. That is a precautionary measure, which would be implemented only if a test detected BSE in sheep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states will be required to report TSE cases to the Commission and to carry out compulsory BSE monitoring and testing programmes, which will be used to categorise countries and to provide information to the Commission annually. Hon. Members will know that the UK submits regular BSE reports to the Commission and the measure will ensure that all other member states also test for, monitor and report BSE cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal will introduce a system of categorisation that is compulsory for all member states and optional for third countries, all of which are asked to submit an application to the Commission. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
application must contain the results of risk analyses and BSE test results, as set out in the regulation. The Commission will categorise each country according to its BSE status and its risk of BSE. A country with high BSE status will have to implement the most stringent controls in the proposal. One with low BSE status will be exempt from certain measures or required to implement them to a lesser degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government welcome the proposal because a member state's BSE status will be judged both on test results and on implemented control measures. The control measures that will be examined include feed production and waste disposal. We believe that that is an appropriate way to ensure that measures to counteract TSEs are effective. It will not allow countries with no perceived BSE to water down effective proposals. The measures will be proportional to the disease situation in an individual country while risk assessment measures will mean that member states will have to prove their BSE status to the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental gain for the UK from the proposal and related measures will be that important steps will be taken to protect human and animal health in all EU countries and will create a more level playing field for UK industry regarding terms of trade that have existed in the EU for some time. That is why, despite some reservations about details in the proposal, there has been strong support for action at EU level, such as the introduction of a feed ban, banning mammalian meat and bonemeal from animal feed, which has operated in the UK for several years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sectors of UK agriculture have complained about uneven competition in the EU that has arisen from the disaster of BSE and the necessary controls that were introduced in our country. For example, although BSE does not exist in pigs, pig producers complained that they were subject to stricter feed controls than those in other EU countries. The regulation will make competition fairer for such producers, although its main purpose is the protection of human and animal health, and we support it on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the Government's action to ensure that the regulation recognises the measures that we have implemented, whose success is increasingly being recognised in the EU. Ministers must be guided by scientific and expert advice in introducing the measures. None the less, we are encouraged by a year-on-year reduction in BSE cases, which shows that those measures are having an effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have until 11.30 am for questions. I ask hon. Members to be brief and to ask questions one at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cummings. EU document No. 5196/99 appears to contain a printing error. Page two lapses into French, to which I do not object, but page three has been completely omitted. I do not know whether
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
that page is crucial to understanding the document, but, if it is available, hon. Members should be provided with it. Could that be considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is regrettable. The Minister may wish to offer an explanation, because Departments are responsible for the distribution of papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I cannot offer an instant explanation for the missing page or the page in French. I shall make inquiries in my Department about how that has occurred and whether it can be quickly rectified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that essential to progress in tackling BSE is a good screening test? It is easy to find the prion in animals that have the disease; the problem is finding it in those that have pre-clinical symptoms, or those that have yet to develop symptoms. We need to determine the extent of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work going on in Europe to detect animals that are incubating the disease is essential. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the tests being carried out—the so-called diagnostic tests—to find the extent of incubation of the prion in European herds is not validated as a sure-fire indicator? Much effort is being invested, but we need to hasten research to find a test. There will be a big problem if the disease turns up in our national flock of 40 million sheep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right in his two points about tests. It is important to continue research into the efficacy of tests and, particularly, to find a test that will work properly on live animals, and that is more capable of diagnosing incubation and the early stages of the disease. The research being carried out by Departments and elsewhere in the EU is essential. There must be a collaborative effort to avoid duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point about the theoretical possibility of BSE in sheep is important. We are undertaking research on that and examining what contingency measures would be necessary should it occur. I stress that a lot of work has been done, but so far it has not revealed BSE in sheep. I say that not to sound complacent, or to suggest that we are not pursuing the programme, but to give reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about feed regulations. Fishmeal for cattle and sheep is an excellent feed, and provides a useful market for a byproduct of the fishing industry. There are no medical reasons why it should not be used as feed, and I see no scientific basis for the ban. What are the Government doing to try to reverse the ban so that we have a sensible use for that economic product?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Committee may want to consider that issue, which is covered in the explanatory memorandum, but I endorse the hon. Gentleman's general comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
At the Agriculture Council in December, we managed to obtain an alteration to the proposals to allow fishmeal to be given to non-ruminants. That was a useful concession, which was welcomed by, for example, the poultry sector. There will be opportunities for further discussion on all issues. On some points, we are discussing temporary measures to tide us over until July, and will consider further measures later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cases of BSE that have been discovered in various European countries have caused some alarm. Those countries, and the European Commission, are examining a range of measures quickly, and such speed does not always create the best climate in which to make long-term decisions. The UK has a responsibility to explain what seems to have worked in the UK, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is being done. However, I remind him that we must not lose sight of the wider goal: the adoption of measures at European level to tackle Europe's emergent BSE problem and to improve terms and conditions for our producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Cummings, and to the Minister, for my late arrival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm whether it is mandatory to report instances of scrapie or any TSE in sheep, and whether those sheep are then tested for BSE in the same way that cattle would be? Will she also give us her appraisal, or her Department's appraisal, of the efficacy of the diagnostic tests that have been alluded to this morning and in the memorandum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangements for reporting scrapie in sheep are similar to those for reporting BSE. We are worried about the under-reporting of scrapie, which has been a problem in the UK and other countries. The TSE regulation attempts to redress that, and aims to show the importance of building up a proper picture of the incidence of scrapie in all European Union countries—scrapie exists in a number of them. The measures specified in the regulation are obligatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that I have an immediate response to the hon. Gentleman's question about testing for scrapie. Inspiration might strike me later in the sitting, but I would not want to make pronouncements about the accuracy of the test that could misinform him. In the UK, however, our testing means that we have longer experience and a more detailed knowledge of the matter than do other countries, and we have a duty to share that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Drew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend clarify the position on the feeding of meat and bonemeal material to dogs? Under paragraph 1.13 of the 31st report of the European Scrutiny Committee, it would seem that that is allowed, but other statements suggest that it is banned from being fed to any animal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I struggle to answer my hon. Friend, because I, too, have seen different suggestions about the matter. There are rules about what can be put into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
pet food, and I understand that they are separate from the TSE regulation. If that is incorrect, I will amend my response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pet food has separate rules under the Animal Byproducts Order 1992. As the Committee has asked for a separate session on the animal waste and byproducts regulations, we can come back to the matter then. The Pet Food Manufacturers Association recommends that certain products should be excluded from pet food, and material from diseased animals—including those suspected of having a TSE—is not used in pet food at all, which is reassuring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no known cases of dogs becoming TSE cases, and the scientific information suggests that it is not possible. If that is incorrect, I shall inform my hon. Friend and the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My questions concern the details of specified risk material, and the right hon. Lady might require notice to answer them. The spinal cord is a specified risk material. How is it defined in European terms? Does the definition include dorsal root ganglia, and if so, is a distinction drawn between it and other ganglionic material and material from the sympathetic nervous system? Such material can be part of the same cell as a dorsal root ganglion, and yet it appears that it does not count as SRM. Scientifically, that is illogical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My information is that dorsal root ganglia count as specified risk material, along with the brain, the spinal cord, and the trigeminal ganglia. The hon. Gentleman may understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I do, but, as with many technical matters, after it has been explained, it is hard to retain all the details. The distal ileum, which is part of the gut, is also included as a specified risk material. I shall examine my reply, and if I have not dealt with every detail, I shall inform the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my right hon. Friend been able to get a feeling about the response of our European partners to the Phillips inquiry? If so, is that reflected in the documents that we are discussing today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Some of the measures in the TSE regulation have a lot in common with the measures that were taken in the UK in response to BSE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal of interest across the European Union in the Phillips inquiry and in its subsequent report, which is widely available and has been much read throughout the EU. I feel strongly that the UK must fully explain the measures that it has taken. There has been ill-informed press comment about the matter both in the UK and in other EU countries. The in-depth nature of the Phillips report and the concern that is now felt throughout Europe about BSE mean that we have a responsibility to explain what we have done. We should also explain which controls seem to work, both to obtain an understanding of any alternative provisions that we might wish to pursue, which have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
been recognised in the TSE regulation, and to give advice, support and help to our partners in dealing with the problems that we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a delicate area. BSE was seen as a British issue. On occasion, wild comments have been made about our history regarding animal feed exports. We must show ourselves willing to join other European Union countries in applying the most effective controls possible, but, at the same time, we can make a positive contribution in sharing our experience and working with our partners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dobbin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Protecting the public always involves a cost. Does the Minister think that we have the right balance between public protection and the cost to industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question and one that we must keep in mind when we examine the European Commission's proposals. We might want to return to the explanatory memorandum about the proposed feed ban measures that was recently sent to the Committee. We must assess proposals carefully in terms of the cost to industry and in light of the advice given to us by the Food Standards Agency and by our scientific experts.

Overall, the Government strongly believe that the balance is advantageous for us, both in protecting human and animal health and in helping our industry to survive under better and fairer conditions of competition than has been the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, north-east Scotland was a producer of premium quality beef for the export market before the BSE crisis. Does she see anything in the regulations that will improve the date-based export scheme by moving away from designated places that do not meet the quality requirement to designated days in places that meet the requirements of the export market, which still wants the product?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not immediately. However, the measures are part of an important effort to rebuild consumer confidence across Europe. Because they apply to all countries and the strength of our controls is increasingly recognised, the measures will prepare the ground so that we can export under less onerous terms in future. However, we must proceed cautiously. We certainly do not want to send a message that we are relaxing our controls or that we are arguing for changes that would jeopardise animal or public health and food safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good case for changing certain aspects of the date-based export scheme that make it difficult for our producers to export. The general move towards stronger measures across Europe is in our interests, so we will be able to make a good case. However, I do not want to raise false hopes that that will happen immediately. The political climate is not adequately favourable, but a more even playing field will be to our advantage in making those arguments in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the Standing Committee considering the Hunting Bill. Every time I look across at the Opposition Benches in that Committee, I see the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who stuffed a hamburger into his daughter's mouth. I suspect that that image is still in the mind of the public. Would my right hon. Friend comment on how the work of the Food Standards Agency and Sir John Krebs has eroded that image?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The creation of the Food Standards Agency has been an essential step in rebuilding public confidence in the safety of food. It also removed a perceived clash of interest in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food acting on behalf of producers and consumers. That separation was important. The FSA advises us on those matters, and we accept its advice. My hon. Friend's question gives me the opportunity to say that the Ministry and the FSA take the same approach to TSE regulation and some of the other recent proposals from Brussels. We have been guided by the FSA's approach on animal feed and consumer safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Ministry oppose the proposed ban on pithing during negotiations in Brussels? Has the Ministry assessed the impact that the ban will have on the smaller UK abattoirs, which may be pushed over the edge? The ban will exacerbate the current closure programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The pithing ban was part of a wider decision; although we thought that the ban was not justified, we believed that the overall balance of the regulation should be supported. That takes me back to a previous question on cost. Although some of the measures will impose a cost on the industry, we believe that the industry will benefit from a more level playing field; it more than counteracts the cost. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the industry was consulted on pithing. The implementation of the ban was delayed, with the support of the FSA, in order to allow some of the changes that need to be made in order to reduce stun-to-stick time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the extra support that we have given small and medium-sized abattoirs as a result of the implementation of the Maclean report recommendations. It was certainly welcomed by the industry. The FSA's view is that alternatives to pithing are available to small abattoirs at a reasonable cost. I know that the Meat Hygiene Service and the FSA are discussing them with the small abattoirs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to risk assessment. On whose advise is the categorisation from 1 to 5 chosen?

Will they take account of new policies—for example, the pithing ban or a ban on mechanically recovered meat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assessment of the risk status of member states was carried out according to a methodology established by the Scientific Steering Committee in Brussels, which has been published on

the internet. It explains how the various categories were arrived at. It links in to the work of the OIE—for the benefit of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), that is the Organisation Internationale des pizooties. The OIE's work has been accepted by EU member states and third countries. Member states provided dossiers of information about testing and the incidence of BSE, which were examined by a panel of independent experts from EU and non-EU countries. The Scientific Steering Committee examined information that we provided on exports of bovine material when it made its assessment of geographic risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the categories that have been decided on as a result of the process are fair. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) makes an important point about ensuring that new developments be fully reflected in categorisation. I understand that the Scientific Steering Committee conducts continuous monitoring to make its categorisation as up-to-date and accurate as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask about dealings with countries that are not members of the European Union. One of the remarkable features of the early stages of the BSE epidemic was that a significant number of cases were reported in the Swiss Jura, yet none, apparently, in the French Jura where the cattle populations and husbandry methods are almost identical. After the establishment of a common public health regime for the European Union, is work being done on extending it by agreement to other European countries that are not members, so that we can extend the zone of confidence in Europe? I am particularly interested in including Switzerland in that, because it has a significant history of reported cases of BSE. I imagine that it would want to make common cause with the European Union as far as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The relationship with third countries varies. Countries in the European Economic Area are directly included in discussions. Switzerland is not in the European Economic Area and is therefore somewhat separate, but I know that it is keen to engage in discussions with us about the relevant issues. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, many people in Switzerland would like to be part of the wider trading arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Swiss Government tend to follow EU measures closely, because they need to do that to facilitate trade, even though Switzerland is not in the EEA. It has similar public health protection to ours and an active surveillance and testing programme. Indeed, the figures that the hon. Gentleman quoted about the Jura reflect that. Clearly, much more testing is now being done in France than previously and more cases have been reported as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The action that the hon. Gentleman is interested in is part of the role of the OIE, not the EU. That is the forum for exchange of information. Work in the OIE plays an important part in determining the attitude of the Commission and its scientific committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a useful point. We are considering issues that are extremely important to British consumers and to our farming community, which has undergone a traumatic experience. That community expects all right hon. and hon. Members to take a keen interest in such issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my right hon. Friend assessed other infection routes, such as vaccines using bovine material?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Ministry does not cover all the issues to which my hon. Friend referred. The Health Council has considered some of them, but I have not followed them all closely. However, they are the subject of work by the Government—under the Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency—and the European Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the optimistic side was the levelling of the playing field. Yesterday's 	<i>Financial Times</i> contained a story about Brussels planning to reform beef subsidies in the light of the cost of the BSE crisis. What is her position on the down side, which is that we are likely to be beaten with a big stick for having been seen to initiate the BSE crisis? Will there be any levelling of the playing field, given that we met much of the costs to our industry and our country from our own coffers? Will that apply to other countries in the European Union, or will they benefit from European Union support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two aspects to that question. The EU supported us financially through the BSE crisis. Even with the costs mentioned by the Commission, the UK contribution would be less than what we received in support for our anti-BSE measures. I know that the industry has expressed concern about support for tackling BSE in other countries, and I understand those concerns. However, we received support from the EU. There was a national contribution, as there is or will be in other countries for some measures proposed at European level. The financial contribution into the UK is greater than the likely one from the UK. In a single market, and with a common agricultural policy, it makes sense for us to regard BSE as a European problem, and to be prepared to play our full part financially. We are seen in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the measures that the Commission proposed yesterday. That is so recent that we have not yet been able to evaluate all their implications, and we want to discuss with the industry its reaction to those proposals. My initial reaction is to be reluctant to adopt measures that disadvantage our producers compared with those of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
other countries. The Government must always aim not to disadvantage their own economy and producers unfairly in European negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have reservations about alterations to schemes, for two reasons. First, they could cause producers further problems at a difficult time for the agricultural industry. That is the most powerful reason. Secondly, such alterations involve a lot of administrative work for Government Departments. Given the range of proposals that we must respond to, the hon. Gentleman will understand that my Department is under a lot of pressure. Substantial changes to schemes and programmes also involve changing IT systems and so on, so they should not be embarked upon lightly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The penultimate question was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) and was a medical one. The Minister's answer was interesting, but perhaps slightly evasive. Will she tell the Committee about the parameters for discussion of BSE at a national and international level? When the BSE is on the agenda, does the discussion include the possibility of alternatives? If it does not, are we not wrong about that? The last question was on financial matters, which are not entirely within the control of the Minister's Department. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) received a lengthy answer, and there was no holding back. However, the medical question, which is important, was rather shoved aside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's comment. The question is complex, and I hesitated over it because I felt that I could not do justice to it by replying off the top of my head. My hon. Friend asked about infection routes. Much work has been done on the routes of infectivity in cattle, because of the BSE situation, and there are, on that at least, many generally accepted views. The main route is considered to be through infected animal feed, which is why the measures taken at a European level focus on animal feed controls. What can be put into animal feed is controlled, and attempts are made to prevent any possible cross-contamination. That is why industries such as the UK pig industry were subject to controls even though there was no BSE in pigs. There was concern about cross-contamination on farms, and that somehow the contamination could lead to wider problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work has also been done on the possibility of maternal transmission. Our offspring cull and offspring control measures, which are part of the over-30-months scheme in the UK, are geared at eliminating that possibility. Some of the fears of large-scale maternal transmission seem to have been allayed by the fact that there are very few cases of BSE in younger animals. The disease generally affects older animals. Each year, the average age of BSE suspects is increasing, which seems to suggest that we are eliminating the disease gradually, year on year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
A considerable amount of work has been done on infection routes. However, there are various theories about transmission, which need to be tested in research programmes. In my original answer, I told my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North that the research programmes sometimes go wider than my Ministry. However, I do not want to convey the impression that we are not interested in the results of those research programmes. Far from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm the number of BSE cases that we still experience in the UK? I understand that it is more than the rest of the EU countries put together. Will she share with the Committee her views on why we are still experiencing such a high incidence of cases? Despite all the measures that the Ministry has taken over the past 10 years and more, does she feel that the measures before us will dramatically reduce that level of incidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the last point first. I do not believe that any of the measures before us are capable of having a dramatic effect on the incidence of BSE in the UK—other than those measures that we are already taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to provide the Committee with the total. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the number of animals affected is precisely recorded. In 2000, we saw a 40 per cent, reduction in incidence on the previous year, and in 1999 we saw a reduction of a similar order of magnitude on the previous year. Last year, there were between 1,000 and 2,000 cases; there were between 2,000 and 3,000 cases the year before. I shall get the exact figures for the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was 1,337.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says it was 1,337. I am glad that what I said has not been disproved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures provide some comfort, but the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) was right to say that we have more cases than other member states. I stress that that the number of cases in the UK is declining, and that the number of cases in some other European countries seems to be rising. We have a good story to tell about control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers are always nervous about giving reassurances; no one wants to give false information. An examination of the statistical evidence shows not only a year-on-year fall but, as I said in response to a previous question, the average age of infected animals is continually increasing. The hon. Gentleman knows that a certain number of cases were forecast even after the feed ban was thought to be totally effective. In fact, the number of confirmed cases is much lower than scientists predicted, which is reassuring. Although the overall number of cases in the UK was far higher than in other member states, it is recognised in Europe that the year-on-year fall in the number of cases and the fall in the ages of the infected animals are points in our favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the changes that resulted from the criticisms made in the Phillips report of Tenderers, slaughterhouses, knackers' yards and hunt kennels, is the new TSE regulation likely to toughen controls further in those areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will involve some changes to controls, which are laid out in the legislation. The changes that will have the greatest effect on the industry generally are the animal feed temporary measures, about which the Committee has just been informed. The effect of those measures on the industry needs to be studied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation is likely to have a minimal effect on the industries that my hon. Friend mentioned, given that the changes to which he referred have already come into force. However, he also reminded me of the importance of implementation of the measures. As he pointed out, there have been failures in the past in the relevant sectors, and therefore Governments have a responsibility to ensure that the measures are known about and fully implemented by the services in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 5196/99, a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and a draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/68/EEC; and supports the Government's objective of achieving Community-wide measures against transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, especially in the light of recent findings that BSE is more widespread in Europe than had previously been acknowledged—	<i>[Ms Quin.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twice in one week we are debating TSEs, and, in particular, BSE. The Government's response to the Phillips report will be debated on Thursday. All the measures that we are considering are important, but, as the Minister has confirmed, many of the key measures that she and her Ministry consider vital to the elimination of BSE have already been carried out by the Ministry in the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise several worries with the Minister, beginning with the recent German beef imports in which specified risk material was discovered in some carcases. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the Government have now established appropriate checks so that the regulations incorporated in the memorandum about the removal of the relevant material—in particular, spinal column —are followed to the standards that we require of abattoirs in this country? That should apply not just to German imports but imports from the rest of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is illegal in this country to sell meat from animals more than 30 months old. Will the Minister confirm that it is still possible for animals over that age to be killed and butchered on the continent and processed into meat products that are legally imported? Apparently we are happy to import meat products that may include meat from animals older than 30 months. Will the measures proposed in the memorandum, for all-herd culling when an instance of BSE is discovered,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
help to eradicate that problem? I understand that a 30-month rule is not to be introduced on the continent, but will culling all animals in a cohort or a farm help to overcome that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This country has been dealing with the problem that we are considering for many more years than our European counterparts. They are on the upward part of the curve with respect to incidence of the disease, and no one knows where that is going. I do not know whether the Minister, her Ministry, or her counterparts in the European Commission, have considered possible scenarios—cases A, B, C and so on—as to how quickly the Commission and the various nation states could get on top of the problem, which has serious implications for the common agricultural policy budget. Have any studies been made of the possibilities of huge pressure on it in forthcoming years, depending on assessments of how serious the problem is likely to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our farmers have been concerned about unexplained situations, such as that in the Swiss Jura that was alluded to this morning. Perhaps because Swiss farmers receive full value for the animal, they have reported a high incidence of BSE over the years, but not one case has been reported a few miles across the border in the French Jura. The Minister avoided answering the question about that directly, as it could open a can of worms that we do not want to open. Our farmers believe that there has been under-reporting on the continent, especially in France. The current incidence may be low in relation to the real incidence that has not been reported in the past. Assessments must be made so that we can arrive at some sensible figure of the pressure on the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister for her Ministry's assessment of the efficacy of the diagnostic test mentioned in the memorandum, which is supposedly used in Europe to test for BSE. She admitted that she did not have all the details at the time, and no doubt she will give me more information in her response today or in writing. It is no problem to slaughter an animal and inspect its brain, but we are now talking about determining whether a live animal shows early signs of BSE. It is my understanding that there is no valid test for that, but such a test is being bandied around in the memorandum as though it were real and could be used. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the diagnostic tests are worth the paper on which they are written?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done some research and spoken to various people in the past year, and I came across a scientist who claimed that he could test for BSE using a cow's urine. He cannot get anywhere with the Ministry, which will not even carry out a simple test to see whether he is right. I should have thought that any scientist claiming that he or she has an early test for BSE should be taken seriously. It would not take a great deal of time, effort or money to establish whether that claim were true. The implications of an early BSE test for animals are enormous in terms of the risk to human health and the impact on an industry that has suffered terribly during the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
The Minister also avoided, or perhaps forgot to answer, my specific question on sheep. I asked whether it was mandatory for farmers who detect or suspect scrapie in their flock to report that to the authorities, and whether an animal, once it has been taken in by the authorities, is tested for BSE as well as scrapie. Scrapie is a type of TSE. We have been happily eating scrapie-infected sheep for centuries, so it may not be as transmissible as BSE. There is no direct link, but some people with senile dementia may have picked up encephalopathy as a result of eating such meat. However, no one has proved that yet. It will be important to determine whether the BSE prion, rather than being found only in cattle, may be found in sheep and other animals in a variant form. After all, it is now said that there is scientific proof of a connection between BSE and variant CJD—that they are pretty well one and the same thing. It surprises me that it should not affect other mammals, particularly sheep and other ruminants that may well have come into contact with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have written to Professor Prusener, whose prion theory seems to be accepted as the explanation for all this, but, with due respect to him, he does not really understand how this has happened. I am puzzled as to how the prion, which has no DNA, can replicate itself. How does it grow if it has no DNA? That has not been explained by anyone. Although people say that that is the most likely answer, even the cause is still not understood. We still do not know where BSE came from, and we still do not understand where it is going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we accept the measures, and I am pleased that the Government negotiated a derogation on herd culling. However, it may well be that BSE is present in young animals under 30 months of age. The 30-month time limit seems arbitrary. It may have been based on vets saying that, at 30 months, certain teeth appear, so that an animal's age can be accurately pinpointed at that stage. No doubt the Minister will confirm that 30 months is an arbitrary time limit, not based on any science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, cattle have manifested BSE under the age of 30 months, just as they have over that age. However, the Minister is right to say that the imposition of the limit has led to a diminution in the annual incidence of cases. She did not say that, on that basis, the disease will be eliminated in five years or 10 years—we simply do not know that. It is said that taking an arbitrary figure such as that is similar to claiming that one is eliminating Parkinson's disease by killing people over 50. If one eliminates the population at a certain stage, the disease will not manifest itself. We do not know whether 30 months is a critical time or not. There are many unanswered questions on BSE, and it is important for the Minister to assure the Committee that her Department is still putting money into the necessary research, not just for proper diagnostic testing, which is important, but to get to the heart of the problem, so that in the end the Government will be able to declare that eating beef and meat of all kinds is perfectly safe. We say that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
eating beef is safe, but, under scrutiny, no one can prove that BSE prions are not present in younger animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good discussion. The questions have been pertinent to the document before the Committee. The matters should be addressed on a Europe-wide basis, but it is also important that there is a level playing field for our producers. I refer back to the problem of beef imports, and to the processed meat issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Drew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to engage in this important debate, coming as it does on the cusp on an even more important debate on the Phillips report and the Government's reaction to that. I wish to make four key points on which I hope the Minister will comment. My remarks will not necessarily differ from the line of questioning of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will start with what the eminently common-sense proposition that the measures are important because they embody the precautionary principle. The Government have made it clear that that is one of their guiding principles and that is why we set up the independent Food Standards Agency. I hope that we are now examining how we could apply that principle, with the help of other member states, to a European food standards agency. Greater collaboration is required to produce policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman alluded to the great cost associated with the growing problem of BSE on the continent. That will put a strain on the CAP budget. I am not interested only in how we compensate farmers—although that is important—but how we find moneys to extend and enhance scientific investigation. I am interested in the four categories identified by TSE research: diagnostic, epidemiological, pathogenesis and transmission. Will the Minister say how research budgets here, and in Europe as a whole, might be used, and say what is going to be spent where? We must arrive at an understanding of what we want to achieve through TSE and BSE research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may be entering a black hole in speculating how much this will all cost. However, I should like to know how much we are putting into the pot of money for the budget that will be used for collaborative research with our European colleagues and other member states to provide greater clarity on the causes of BSE and possible solutions to end this horrible disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perceptions of whether science is the cause of the problem, or whether it will be our salvation, are also important. What do the regulations say about our attitudes to intensive farming? They may be one more way in which we are questioning intensive farming, which, many of us feel, has gone too far in the wrong direction. They may give us a clear steer about what to expect back from scientific investigation. The results of such investigation will not be purely theoretical and may suggest what we should expect from our farmers, and all concerned in the food chain, in the production of food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
What about the legalities of the issue? We have talked about how we can try to understand, control and eliminate the disease, but is there a smoking gun somewhere? Something or someone must have caused the disease. That may have implications, and not only for our nation, where people can always go to court and claim that they were innocent bystanders. We are talking about the European theatre, and some will try to lay the blame for the problem. I hope that it will not be placed on us alone because the cost implications would be colossal. We must be seen to be cleaner than clean and that is why I ask whether our procedures are correct. We do not want regulation for the sake of it, but we need better regulation—which should be less for our farmers than it is now—and to ensure that all loopholes are closed. Otherwise, it is a question of trying to protect ourselves from potential legal action over not only past events, but what happens today and even in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate, as well as an important prelude to tomorrow's debate. Some will simply lapse into schadenfreude about BSE in Europe. That is a deeply misplaced view, not only because of the tragedy in human, veterinary and economic terms, but because we must be aware that what happens in Europe has serious implications for our industry and what happens in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we can issue reassuring noises in terms of the epidemiology, and the number of incidents of both BSE and new variant CJD, they are predicated on the scientific community's being right about what may be the causative agent, about the transmissibility and about the latency. If any of those factors proves to be wrong in the long term, we may be misleading both ourselves and the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same qualifications apply to the remarks of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire about testing. One can test either for the causative agent or for pre-clinical signs of the condition. Those are the only things that effectively give pre-warning of infectivity. Again, if we do not get that right, it will be difficult to establish an effective test, which means that we must maintain our vigilance on a wide front—certainly in looking for new ovine or caprine encephalopathies. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's view that scrapie might still be involved. The evidence suggested that it was not. It is dangerous to put into the public mind that scrapie might be the causative agent when all the evidence so far is to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must be aware that there may be a circular transmissibility. That brings us back to the sheep or goat population with a new encephalopathy that is related to BSE.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to imply that scrapie was the causative agent. If that was what I seemed to say, I retract it. It is a related TSE. I meant that we are faced with a TSE in sheep. We have all been eating scrapie-infected sheep for a long time, and that has not led to humans contracting some form of TSE disease.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
However, BSE is now claimed to have a direct link. We need to ensure that it has not reached the sheep population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I had not understood the point that he was making. In fact, we are at one on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The moves to establish common standards across the European Union on the matter are desperately important. I congratulate the Ministers and those involved in the discussions on having at least reached stage 1 of a common protocol for the whole EU area. That does not mean that I am entirely satisfied with what is on the table—it could be that Ministers are not entirely satisfied with what they have achieved. The test of any public health measure is in the level of enforcement. As the hon. Gentleman said, we cannot accept a nominal adherence to protocols on the removal of specified risk material, because we may find that such material is present in imported meat. We must, therefore, be confident of the testing in home countries as well as of the procedures that we have in place to test imported meat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some concerns about the proposal to categorise member states in terms of their BSE status, which the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) mentioned in an earlier intervention. Are historical patterns to be the basis for categorisation? There are doubts about some member states' assiduity in identifying and reporting encephalopathies at an early stage. I would be concerned if categorisation were based on historical information rather than on current testing regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why a lower incidence of BSE should necessarily mean a lower level of public health protection or fewer measures. I note, for example, the
	<br><blockquote><p>"prohibition on the use of ruminant skull and vertebral column in the production of mechanically-recovered meat, except in those countries in the lowest category of risk."</p></blockquote>
If we were applying the precautionary principle, we would not make that derogation. The Phillips report identified that where there is an aggregation of meat products—through meat and bonemeal or through mechanically recovered meat—just one infected animal can produce widespread infectivity. The Government accepted that as a matter of policy. The number of identified cases in a country is therefore irrelevant. One infected animal in the vat could result in widespread infection. A common level of protection throughout the European Union, irrespective of identified risk, would be better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be crazy to have different categorisations in, for example, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because many farmers farm on both sides of the border. Tracking would be impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a case in point, and I agree. I suspect that, in the Council of Ministers, countries such as Sweden, where husbandry is very different from the intensive husbandry practised in many parts of the European Union, and where there has been little or no incidence of encephalopathies, asked, quite reasonably, why they should undertake public health
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
measures to combat a risk that had not yet been identified. However, it is still important to maintain public confidence across the European Union, and there is a strong argument that that requires uniform measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some technical questions. What is the scientific basis for the proposals on ruminant fat and bovine blood? I am not aware that current British veterinary thinking has identified either as a centre of infectivity. If there is new evidence, we should be made aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas, the Commission and the Council of Ministers seem to be moving ahead of scientific advice. That can be necessary to maintain public confidence, as the document before us suggests, but it is dangerous to substitute advice from sources outside the scientific establishment. Will the Minister explain the sentence, in the French part of page 2, that suggests that scientific advice can be insufficiently probing or exhaustive? Areas where the Commission has been tempted to replace scientific advice with its own opinion should be clearly labelled. More importantly, more scientific research should be commissioned in those subject areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To underlay the suggested measures, we need better co-ordination of veterinary and epidemiological advice across the European Union. In the Government's response to the Phillips report, they claim that the Veterinary Laboratories Agency has the highest number of veterinary epidemiologists working in one place anywhere in the world. If that is true, it suggests that there is not an equivalent body acting on a Europe-wide basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Organisation Internationale des Epizooties, which the Minister mentioned earlier,-might fulfil such a function. If so, it would be helpful to know how it does that, whether it commissions its own reports on matters of concern, and whether it collects epidemiological evidence, both veterinary and human, across the EU and in other countries where incidents of encephalopathies are believed to have occurred. We should know, for example, whether it examines matters such as the potential—because the theory is still unproved—potentiation by organophosphates, and whether that is a means of increasing the likelihood of infection, rather than being a causative agent. There should be a co-ordinated research programme across Europe on those subjects, and I am not convinced that one is in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) mentioned the potential difficulties of the feed regulations. We might be able to speak about that later, but, as I said last week, there might be a financial disbenefit to our industry if an unnecessary ban on fishmeal is introduced to provide for non-cross-contamination with meat and bonemeal. There is no such cross-contamination in the UK, because of the bans that are already in place. We must work on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
basis of the precautionary measures that we have already taken, rather than on an unjustifiable illusion of public safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can extend the regime to other countries where there are incidents of encephalopathies and that we can have friendly relationships with them to extend the comfort zone. I would include Switzerland in that, as well as some of the applicant countries to the EU that have cross-border trade in animals and meat products. It would be reassuring to know that similar precautions were being taken in those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an essential first step, but there are serious concerns that the package that is emerging will be expensive for British taxpayers and farmers. There is the view that we have paid for the BSE catastrophe once and do not need to do so again. I do not agree with that entirely, because it is important to have common public health measures across the EU. However, I am concerned about the effects on the EU beef regime, which is a subject for another day, and the fact that domestic consumption across Europe is dropping dramatically. International consumption of EU products is likely to follow the same path and, if so, there is a limit on how much beef can be brought into the intervention programme and how much we can extend the purchase with extraction schemes within existing budgets. I do not believe that the British farmer should pay twice for eradicating BSE on the European continent. Those are arguments for another day, but I wanted to make the point because it is desperately important for many beef farmers in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and his general analysis. I just wish to reinforce some of the points that emerged from the statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing both with a major tragedy for the human victims of new variant CJD and with an economic crisis for our farmers and associated industries. Therefore, anything that the regulations can do to address that will be welcome, as will any measures that the Minister believes will level the playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share my hon. Friend's concern about categorisation and derogation. The lesson to be learned from this country is that the disease must be tackled early and fundamentally—from the bottom up. If the EU wishes to learn only part of that lesson, implement that part, and learn more later, the problem will not be tackled quickly enough finally to put the lid back on the bottle, to eradicate the crisis of BSE from EU stock, and avoid exporting BSE to the rest of the world and importing it back from the rest of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the absurdity of the fishmeal ban. Given the stringent regime that already exists concerning feed products given to our animals, I urge the Minister to do everything possible, if not now, from July onwards, to put across logical arguments that will secure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
derogation for this country. Our fishing industry has its own crisis and it will be hit with a double whammy if it cannot get rid of one of its by-products. Fishmeal is made from parts of a fish that are cut off before human consumption. If the fish is good enough for humans, we should question why it is not good enough for animals that have been fed on it for many years. It is not a new regime; fish protein has been part of animal husbandry for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come from the north-east of Scotland, which had a reputation as an exporter of premium quality beef. There is still a demand for such a quality product among European consumers, rather than a fear of it. The quality of the product has not met European expectations when such demand has been met under the new regime of designated places for slaughter and butchery. That has nothing to do with safety or fear. Traditionally, the north-east exporters managed the cattle from the field—through slaughtering, hanging and butchery—to the end-product. That cannot be done if the cattle have to go to through a designated process. If designated days were permitted in the exporters' establishments, they would be allowed to manage the entire process and provide confidence that there would be no cross-contamination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) raised the issue of the confidence that has been created by the Food Standards Agency. I welcome the creation of the FSA and acknowledge the need for independence, I think that it is too soon for that body to have established a major change in the way that the wider country responds to a crisis. The rest of the EU seems to need more public reassurance, as our public have been more mature in their response to the crisis than the markets in the EU, which seemed to collapse more dramatically as soon as the crisis hit. Therefore, I welcome a common standard across the EU to rebuild consumer confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public concern about imports from the EU has been alluded to. Current advice from the Food Standards Agency is that we should not worry about or refuse such imports. However, it will have to reassure the public about what controls are in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the advice of the Food Standards Agency is entirely flaccid? We need a clearer statement of risks and the measures that are being taken. The FSA would do well to proffer clearer advice to the Government and the people of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. If the Food Standards Agency is to establish its new, independent role of giving confidence to the market, it must give a clear and concise explanation as to why it is advising the Government that those imports are acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise again the fast-moving situation that the Government have to deal with. I urge them to use this country's experience to ensure that the European Union moves along the learning curve more quickly so that we can knock this disease on the head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
	<p>12.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ms Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Committee for its broad welcome for the fact that measures are being put in place at European level and that they will have the effects that I mentioned earlier of increasing public protection and helping our producers to compete in fairer competitive conditions. I am grateful for the Committee's comments and endorse the views that have been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, I understand the reservations that hon. Members expressed regarding what may or may not be agreed as the total package of measures, and the need to scrutinise closely the likely costs to our industry and to resist measures that are unjustifiable or that do not take full account of the controls that we already have in place. I welcome the support for some of the concessions that the Government have won, but I also accept the Committee's urging that the Government keep a close eye on the issues to ensure that the effect on our own industry is as benign as possible. Obviously, we must be prepared to introduce measures that are justified on the grounds of science or public and animal health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the issues that were raised are relevant to the full-day debate on the Phillips report tomorrow. I noted some of those comments, and that debate will allow an opportunity for a wider airing of those important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire discussed the difficulties that we have encountered in importing meat from Germany. Some meat had spinal column attached. That is a specified risk material that should have been excluded at the place of slaughter. I assure him that, as a result of those findings, the Food Standards Agency now checks 100 per cent, of the meat imported from Germany. He also mentioned processed products. All animals in Germany aged over 30 months are now tested. Whether meat is imported in processed or fresh form, it will meet the higher safety standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the current regulations. They are from the period when the Conservative Government were in office, and I understand the difficulties that that Government had in controlling processed products. They are difficult to control, but we feel that the controls are now satisfactory because all animals aged over 30 months will be tested. Therefore, there should no longer be concern about the meat of animals aged over 30 months entering the food chain in processed form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government referred those cases to the Food Standards Agency, which advised us about the risks. We accepted its recommendations, while stressing to it the importance of vigilance. The FSA is increasing surveillance of German meat to 100 per cent., and we applaud that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether whole herd culling would help in terms of controls on processed meat. The fact that all animals aged over 30 months are now being tested provides a better safeguard than would whole herd culling. Indeed, one of the strange characteristics of BSE has been the frequency with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
which it has occurred in just one animal in a herd. Our experience is that the over-30-months rule is a more effective way of controlling the disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that, in Germany, the testing of cattle aged over 30 months is not a pre-slaughter test? Are the tests being conducted after the cattle have been slaughtered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is what is happening. I was going to address that, as it was another point that the hon. Gentleman raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that the over-30-months scheme is much more emphatic and reliable than whole herd culling. That is correct. Might the European Union consider the same scheme for cattle on the continent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. The EU might consider that, but I cannot make a firm prediction. There is a lot of interest on the continent in the way that our over-30-months scheme operates. The answer will be influenced by the extent to which consumer confidence in the beef market is restored by the measures that are being taken across Europe. If consumer confidence is not restored, countries will look at other options, such as our over-30-months scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answers to many questions, particularly in relation to cost, depend to a certain extent on what will happen to the beef market in the immediate future. For example, if consumer confidence is restored, large-scale intervention buying and other support measures will not need to be taken to anything like the costly extent that some people fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hard to envisage the budgetary consequences of the current situation. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud referred to that matter. Much will depend on the re-establishment of confidence, and on how many further cases emerge from the testing programme that is now taking place across the EU. Obviously, if the more intensive testing does not result in the emergence of many more cases, consumer confidence is more likely to be restored than if a sizeable number of new cases emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred to the difference between the Swiss Jura and the French Jura, which was subsequently mentioned by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. One can think of possible explanations for the difference, such as the amount of testing that is being conducted in Switzerland, but there are other possible explanations, such as the animal feed that was used. It is often the case that animals on one farm may have different animal feed from animals on a neighbouring farm. Various explanations can be given. The increased amount of testing that is now being done in France will make clear whether the figures were the result of under-reporting and under-diagnosis or whether French feeding practices are less likely to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
spread BSE than the animal feed used in Switzerland. A number of different factors have to be taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that someone, I am not sure whether it was a constituent, had approached him about work that he had done on a BSE test. It is difficult for me to respond to that query now, but the hon. Gentleman may, if he wishes, write to me—or, more appropriately, to my noble Friend Baroness Hayman—we shall be happy to look into the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned that a number of scientific uncertainties exist. In many ways, it is a difficult subject because we are not always dealing with scientific matters. I took comfort from the fact that the number of cases in the UK had decreased, which seemed to indicate that many of the measures that we took were effective, but I do not rule out the importance of continuing, on-going and purposeful research to try to elucidate some of the remaining scientific uncertainties. Indeed, in response to a question earlier this morning, I made it clear that our frustration at the lack of a valid live test was relevant also to the lack of knowledge about BSE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also asked about the reporting of scrapie. Yes, it must be reported. Cases of scrapie are tested for BSE, but I am advised that it takes two years for the test to be valid. It seems extraordinary, but I have no reason to dispute it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about beef being safe. I believe that the controls that we have introduced are important. I emphasise that I say beef is safe only because I am so advised by the Food Standards Agency. Ministers are keen that the role of the FSA should be highlighted and reinforced. Although the FSA was established by Parliament, it will take time for it to acquire a public perception. However, we are determined that its role should be publicly recognised and that people should know why Parliament thought it important to set up an independent authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud mentioned the European dimension and the European Food Authority. Given the existence of the common agricultural policy and the single market, it is an important move that we are determined to support. We want the European Food Authority to have credibility and status, but we also want effective liaison between it and the national authorities. My hon. Friend also mentioned collaboration, which is extremely important. Our financial contribution to European research programmes into BSE is similar to our contribution to research programmes generally; it is in the order of 10 per cent. Our expertise has also involved us in contributing to other BSE research programmes. In some cases we match fund European efforts. I am sure that we can make information available to my hon. Friend and Committee members if they would like it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and others mentioned aspects of the 30-month scheme. There has not been a case of BSE in an animal younger than 30 months in the United Kingdom since 1996.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
That provides a reasonable safety margin. Animals that enter the food chain now are aged 30 months or less, and that provides a buffer of nearly 18 months. I do not think that the period of 30 months was entirely arbitrary. It is half the average BSE incubation period and was part of the precautionary approach that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud talked about earlier. The intention was to create as great a safety margin as possible, while also, with respect to younger animals, applying regulations on offspring cull and controls on possible maternal transmission routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those factors together form pretty strict controls. I have now received a helpful note that states that the 30-month period was adopted on advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee because it was half the average incubation rate. I know that the Food Standards Agency recently endorsed the 30-month limit and the other aspects of our controls in its recent review of BSE and specified risk material controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Phillips report considers the origin of BSE and concludes that the most likely cause was a spontaneous mutation. Committee members made one or two comments about that. Those issues are probably best dealt with in the debate on the Phillips report, but it might be worth mentioning that my right hon. Friends the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Health have jointly commissioned an independent assessment of current scientific understanding of the origins of the BSE epidemic. The results will be considered in due course by SEAC and will be published. The Government intend to publish the information that they obtain by way of scientific advice on the issue in question. We know that there is wide public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome posed an interesting question about whether the European proposals are ahead of scientific advice. In some respects they are. The hon. Gentleman is right to remind us of the importance of following scientific advice. We make that point in European deliberations. Given our history in this matter, we must always be—and seen to be—in favour of strict controls. At the same time, we stress the importance of taking scientific advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters can be complicated if Ministers think that it would be appropriate for their countries to take action beyond what is recommended by the Scientific Steering Committee. A further complication is the fact that the relevant issues are all decided by qualified majority voting in the Council. I believe that that works more in our favour than against us. We all know that complex regulations such as this, with a number of different and specific elements, sometimes produce results that are not entirely in accordance with the advice that the Government are given—in this case, by the Food Standards Agency. However, the FSA supports the TSE regulations on blood, one of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. I freely admit that it is difficult to keep in mind all aspects of the debate when seeking to respond, and I shall look again at what the hon. Gentleman said. If
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
I have not fully answered him, I shall write to him and send copies of the letter to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine raised a number of points similar to those raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. He reiterated the point about fishmeal and made some important observations that we shall certainly keep in mind. I am glad that we have managed to keep the derogation that I referred to earlier; that was welcomed by the poultry industry and others. We shall continue to examine what is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with the hon. Gentleman on one point. He said that such animal husbandry measures have been around for a long time. It is true that mammalian meat and bone meal have been used as animal feed since the 1920s, yet once the mutation occurred—if that is what happened—it allowed a transmission route. That could not have been foreseen when the practice first began, but just because something has been happening for a long time does not necessarily validate it for all time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is surely not suggesting that feeding fishmeal to mammals is a danger. The problem is cross-contamination. Whether or not the practice was common is irrelevant. The sole consideration is whether cross-contamination likely to occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point about cross-contamination, but given that the practices that have existed, cross-contamination was more likely to occur. So the two are related. I feel strongly that we must reevaluate our controls in the light of events—and of scientific findings. That sometimes means that traditional practices must be reconsidered or even banned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no scientific evidence to suggest that we should ban fishmeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but we could once have made a strong defence of animal feed including mammalian meat and bone meal, because no problems had yet been experienced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine also talked about markets collapsing in other counties. It is true that the wider market has collapsed in Germany. As I said earlier, a great deal will depend on how effective the controls are in reestablishing consumer confidence. As well as discussing the matter with the European Council, we are engaged in bilateral discussions with our European partners, and sharing information about our controls. My right hon. Friend the Agriculture Minister has spoken to his German counterpart and I visited Germany three weeks ago, when those issues were very much to the fore. It is important, in trying to avert unjustified market collapses in Europe, that we engaged in bilateral collaboration as well as working through the European Commission and the European Council. I assure the Committee that we attach considerable importance to that.
