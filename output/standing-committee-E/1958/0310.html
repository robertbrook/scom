<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>5th March</i>], In page 19, line 10, to leave out from "Tribunal" to end of Clause and add:
<br><blockquote><p>"after he has attained the age of sixteen years".—[<i>Sir H. Lucas-Tooth</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed</i>.</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of Health (Mr. Derek Walker-Smith)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned I was referring the Committee to the provisions of Clause 122 in the context of what I think is the important issue in regard to this matter, that is to say, what would be the effect on the right to apply twice within 12 months, on the hypothesis of renewal if the first application were put at large, as it would be by the Amendment. To take the extreme case, one has the position in which the first application might be made in the last week of the 12-month period, and I think the Committee has agreed that there must be some check on the rapidity of applications that come on the heels of one another. There would be no point in burdening the tribunal with the consideration of cases at such close intervals, because that would, in effect constitute a re-hearing of the first application. That obviously would not make sense. It is with those considerations in mind that Clause 122 (2, <i>a</i>) gives the power of postponement until up to 12 months from the date of the previous application. The relevant paragraph reads:
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Rules made under this section may in particular make provision (<i>a</i>) for enabling a tribunal, or the chairman of a tribunal, to postpone the consideration of any application by or in respect of a patient, or of any such application of any specified class, until the expiration of such period (not exceeding twelve months) as may be specified in the rules from the date on which an application by or in respect of the same patient was last considered and determined by that or any other tribunal under this Act.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
The Lord Chancellor, who is the rulemaking power under Clause 122, does not, as at present advised, intend to allow, in the rules which he will be making, for the postponement of the application at the end of the 12-month period—that is, an application under Clause 43 (5)—even if an application has been made in the first six months period under Clause 31 (4). The intention is, with the Bill as it stands, that the rule-making power will not be used to shut out the possibility of those two basic applications within a 12-month period, but obviously we cannot guarantee the same forbearance on the part of the Lord Chancellor if the first, or Clause 31, application can tread on the heels and virtually overrun the second, or Clause 43, application. I would not want the Lord Chancellor to have to contemplate rules providing for the cutting out of one of these first two applications. At the moment he cannot, but if my hon. Friend's Amendment were written into the Bill, I apprehend that he would be forced into the position of contemplating doing that by administrative sense and the logistics of the matter.<br><br>
That is the difficulty in the way of accepting the Amendment, and with that in mind my hon. Friend may think it better to leave the matter as it is, in the knowledge that there will always be the right of the second application within the 12-month period, and in the knowledge that one cannot necessarily guarantee that on the basis he would put forward in its stead. I hope he will not wish to press the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the problem which the Minister has put before us. We would not wish to deny anyone a double right of appeal within a 12-month period, but I am still a little unhappy over the category of case which I mentioned, that of the patient who does not put in his application in the first six months, for the reasons I mentioned, such as treatment. As I understand it, he would not be able to make an application until the end of the 12-month period. That might be an undesirable circumstance. It might be that a patient would feel himself improperly precluded from making an appeal some period shortly after the six
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0214">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
months were up, when he became conscious of his rights. If the Minister could assure us that he will look at this matter I would be satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will look into that. It might be possible to extend the right of application of the patient whose detention is not going to be renewed, and therefore to whom the other considerations do not apply. I can anticipate drafting difficulty in putting into an Act of Parliament a concept based on prevision, which is denied to us in this imperfect world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Donald Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make one point which has not come into our discussion so far. Although I support my hon. Friend's Amendment I do not support the other Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Blenkinsop). The reason I support my hon. Friend's Amendment is that I am afraid that this six months' period may not become so much a minimum period as the maximum period in which a patient may appeal, with the consequent risk of a patient's being detained in hospital as a routine, and various clogs put on his appeal, so that it would be six months before he got his appeal through. I hope the Minister will give an assurance that he will watch this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Minister could clear up a difficulty. Under this subsection it is true, surely, that no patient can make a second application in the first 12 months after his initial admission. I think that one of the main purposes of the Amendment is to ensure that he could make an application at any time during that 12 months. I did not quite understand the Minister when he said that the Bill enables the patient to make a second application in the first 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is 12 months and a day. I think I made that clear at our last sitting. In regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Dr. Johnson) we would not countenance any improper clogging of the right of application to the tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
do not wish to press the Amendment. I am grateful that he will take these matters into consideration. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

Clause 32.</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(RECTIFICATION OF APPLICATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. L. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 19, line 14, at the beginning to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(1) The managers of a hospital shall cause all applications for admission of a patient for observation or treatment to be examined for the purposes of this section within four days of the admission by the person prescribed by the Minister in regulations made under section fifty-five of this Act.</p></blockquote>
I want to ask my right hon. and learned Friend if he will help us by clearing up the doubts which occurred to hospital management committees about who is responsible for the scrutiny which will be necessary before determining whether applications are in order or not. It does not seem suitable for committee action, and yet the responsibility is not directly laid on anyone. It seems it would be desirable that someone should be made responsible. It occurred to me that the responsibility should be put upon an appropriate person by regulation under this Bill. Perhaps there is some other way round the difficulty, and perhaps my right hon. and learned Friend could help us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Storey. Would it save time to discuss with this Amendment the Amendment in my name which covers substantially the same point? In page 19, line 14, at beginning insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(1) Within three days of the receipt by them of an application for observation or for treatment the managers of the hospital shall submit the application to the Minister for scrutiny.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many people, including many sections of the medical profession, feel that if there is any safeguard for the patient in the scrutiny of the documents for compulsory treatment it is not right that this scrutiny should be done by the managers of the hospital. Surely it should be done by someone independent of those responsible for detaining the patients?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0215">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
The sort of situation giving rise to misgivings will be the common one where one of the signatories to the recommendation will be the psychiatrist on the staff of the receiving hospital. Under the Bill we are asking the managers to check these documents to see they are accurate from a medical and legal point of view. Any medical scrutiny must be done on behalf of the managers by someone on the medical staff. We are, therefore, asking one member of a medical staff to find inaccuracies in the work of one of his colleagues. That seems improper. It may be that this scrutiny is a nugatory process, but as there is a subsection devoted to it, the Minister must set some store by it.<br><br>
The scrutiny has always been done by the Board of Control. There have been virtues in having a central authority to do this and bring common standards to bear on the certificates, which will be the medical recommendations in future. The staff of the Board of Control will be at the Ministry and I would have thought that it would be desirable if the Minister were to make them responsible for the scrutiny of these documents.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
In order to make this possible I have put down the Amendment in my name. It requires the managers of the hospital to forward the application for observation or for treatment within three days of receipt. I know the Minister is reluctant to take on the duties which we wish to place upon his shoulders by this Bill, but I feel there is everything to be said for central scrutiny in this case, and I hope he will be prepared to accept this additional burden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to support the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger) and I do not think I can do better than endorse what he and the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) have said over the matter of this scrutiny of documents. One feels particularly anxious about it in connection with a Clause like this, since documents can be altered within a very close circle indeed As the hon. Member has just explained, one of the doctors on the staff of the hospital, if he has not said the right thing, can go round to the hospital office in two or three days' time and alter it at will.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
I submit that in these matters of detention legal questions arise. One has to put this question to my right hon. and learned Friend, Are the patients going to be able to establish an action for illegal detention under the terms of this Bill, or are they not? They must know one way or the other. Either they have a right of action in some form for dealing with detention—and we know that these laws are open to sharp practices on occasion—or they are not. If they have a right of action, then there must be some firm rules about documents and their alteration. The documents should be in the hands of a responsible party.<br><br>
From time to time when I have put matters forward over the last two or three years, my authorities have tended to be questioned, but in this matter I feel I have a quite unimpeachable authority at my back. I read from the document which I have here which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"All procedures need scrutiny to determine what practical value they have as safeguards in the patient's interest."</p></blockquote>
The document from which I am reading is the evidence of the Ministry of Health and Board of Control to the Royal Commission. I do not think I can do better than quote my right hon. and learned Friend's own Department in support of the case we are putting forward. I hope, therefore, that he will consider this matter very seriously indeed, and accept some form of scrutiny of documents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) for his suggestion that these Amendments should be taken together, and I am grateful for your acquiescence, Mr. Storey, in that. It is convenient that they should be taken together although, as the Committee knows, the two Amendments raise different points on this matter. My hon. Friend's Amendment is relatively narrow, because although it would impose on the managers a specific duty to arrange for all applications to be examined within four days of admission, it would not remove from them the duty of scrutiny, whereas the hon. Gentleman's Amendment is, of course, of a more radical character, because it would transfer the duty of scrutiny from the managers, where the Bill now places it, to the Minister.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
If I may refer to the narrower point first, there is, I am advised, no need to impose a statutory duty of scrutiny as such, because the documents would be examined under the Bill as it stands as soon as possible as a matter of routine in each individual case. The need is to give a power to deal with difficulties as they arise, calling for amendments and so on, and this is what the Bill does. So far as the actual method of it is concerned, which I gather is what my hon. Friend really wants reassurance about, the scrutiny would not be by individual members of the hospital management committee, nor would their personal consent be necessary for the amendments contemplated under the Clause. The power exists in Clause 55 (3) for regulations to be made to determine the manner in which the manager's functions may be performed or exercised by officers or other persons acting on behalf of the managers, authorities or boards. What will probably happen is that we shall make regulations under that Clause defining the officers who would exercise the functions of the managers in respect of the scrutiny. If it were necessary, I could introduce an Amendment on Report to require the managers to cause the documents to be scrutinised by persons prescribed in the regulations.<br><br>
On the time factor, perhaps I could point out that the 14 days in this Clause is, of course, the maximum overall period for amendment, and not the time within which it is contemplated that the examination should take place. The examination, I am sure, will take place much more quickly and in the ordinary way within the four-day period which my hon. Friend has in mind.<br><br>
Coming to the more radical Amendment of the hon. Gentleman, he is right in his prophecy that I am reluctant to accept the powers embarrassingly proposed for me, because I am satisfied, on a careful consideration of this matter, and having regard both to experience of the past, where we have had central scrutiny and to the measured recommendations of the Royal Commission, that it would not be appropriate to substitute central scrutiny for hospital level scrutiny as proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
Perhaps I may explain this to the Committee by seeing first of all what the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
examination consists of, and what the objects are, because there are two objects of the examination of documents. The first object is to ensure that the documents are technically correct and that they provide good documentary authority for the detention. The second object is to ensure that the documents accurately describe the condition of the patient.<br><br>
The first object is achieved by a clerical check of the documents, and the second object requires a medical check of the documents. The clerical check will ensure, for example, that the application is filled in with all the statutory particulars described under Clauses 25 to 29 which we have been discussing: that no essential part of the document is left blank; that they are signed by people who appear to be qualified in the way that they are supposed to be, and that the dates are correct—for example, that the medical examinations are not more than seven days apart, as required by Clause 28 (1). All that is a clerical examination.<br><br>
On the other hand, the medical examination concerns the description of the patient according to the category of mental disorder as defined earlier in the Bill, the particulars in support which are required to be made by regulations under Clause 26 (2, <i>a</i>), and the reasons in support of the opinion that detention is necessary in the interests of the patient, which are required under Clause 26 (2, <i>b</i>). Those are a medical and not a clerical form of examination. The medical object of the examination can, of course, be achieved only if it is done by a doctor who has himself seen and examined the patient, and that is the root of this matter. Scrutiny by people who have not seen the patient can fulfil only the first or clerical object, and cannot fulfil the second or medical object.<br><br>
The Royal Commission was very definite about this matter and devoted a lot of attention to it in paragraphs 747 to 762 of its Report. It said this at paragraph 749:
<br><blockquote><p>"No routine scrutiny of the documents alone by a person who has not examined the patient can provide any check on their accuracy nor any safeguard against the deliberate submission of false documents or against errors of information or of diagnosis. In so far as the central scrutiny of documents may have come to be regarded as a safeguard for the patient from this point of view, we should make it clear that this is quite illusory."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
Then it goes on at paragraph 751:
<br><blockquote><p>"In our view, it should be made clear in future that the primary responsibility for ensuring that there is proper documentary authority for the use of compulsory powers lies with those who use those powers and who would be responsible if they were improperly used, that is to say, the hospital authorities and local health authorities …"</p></blockquote>
It reaches its conclusion at paragraph 760 in these words:
<br><blockquote><p>"The present system of submitting all documents for routine central scrutiny is unnecessary and should be abandoned."</p></blockquote>
The same point is made under sub-paragraph (<i>g</i>) of paragraph 761 in the summary of conclusions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman pointed to the experience of the Board of Control in this matter. Of course, it has great experience, and it said at paragraph 99 of its evidence to the Royal Commission:
<br><blockquote><p>"The number of documents received by the Board of Control each week is shown in Appendix E."</p></blockquote>
They are very voluminous indeed, as the hon. Gentleman will recall. It went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is doubtful whether the time spent in scrutinising and filing these documents is justified by the value of the scrutiny which, as we have suggested, may be more apparent than real."</p></blockquote>
As I have pointed out, that is because the medical value of the examination depends upon its being done by a doctor who has seen the patient. All that does not, I hasten to say, for a moment mean that scrutiny is not an important aspect of this mental health procedure and that it should not be done by people best able to secure the two objects that I have defined. It is certainly possible to give central guidance from the Ministry as contemplated by the Royal Commission, and we would certainly have that in mind. The documents will also be available to the tribunal on an application to it and in regard to discharge.<br><br>
Therefore, the conclusion to which I think the logic of the matter drives us is that it would be wrong to transfer responsibility for the scrutiny of these documents from the hospital authorities, where it lies under the Bill, to the Minister, where the hon. Gentleman seeks to put it. Both the objects of the scrutiny—the clerical and the medical objects, which, I say again, are very important—can be satisfactorily achieved and, I believe, only satisfactorily achieved
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
on the basis as prescribed in the Bill, fortified by the central guidance from the Ministry where proper and required. For that reason I would recommend the Committee to leave the matter as it stands, and not to accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Edith Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say only one thing. I am very glad to hear the Minister say that he will consider moving an Amendment at a later stage which will specify those who may be responsible for scrutinising the documents at the hospital end. He might bear in mind the point that the psychiatrist who works at the hospital and who signs one of the recommendations might well not be included in that particular group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without having an actual transcript of what my right hon. and learned Friend said, I think his assurance went very closely in parallel with my Amendment, and I think therefore that we can safely leave it to him, if he will do so, to move an Amendment himself on Report. I am sure that the object I have in mind will be adequately met. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just say, now that that Amendment is out of the way, that we are always, I think, in a difficulty in this Committee when the Minister agrees—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman speaking to his Amendment which he asked should be discussed with the last Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am now proposing, with your permission, Mr. Storey, to give reasons why I do not propose to move the Amendment in my name.<br><br>
I was saying that we are in a difficulty on these occasions when the Minister and his advisers agree with the Royal Commission. This formidable weight of opinion is one which Members on both sides of the Committee have very great difficulty in shifting. I think there is a good deal of force in the arguments which the Royal Commission adduced about the shortcomings of scrutiny in the past by the Board of Control. Quite clearly, in future there will be not nearly so many documents coming forward for scrutiny,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0218">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
but if it has been done in the past as carelessly as we have been led to believe, perhaps there is something there not consistent with central control in the future. I cannot agree with the Minister that scrutiny of the documents in these circumstances is of great value to the patient. I think that, if there were carelessness, or even something worse, it would be most unlikely that it would be uncovered with the procedure envisaged in the Bill; but I do not think that that will happen very often, and in view of that, I do not propose to move my Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 19, line 30, after "period", to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"and with the consent of the Mental Health Review Tribunal".</p></blockquote>
I think I can be very brief in this matter because, in effect, the arguments have been covered. I wish only to say that any improper scrutiny of documents does alarm me very much, because here we are dealing with somebody sent in on insufficient grounds which would be very relevant to any legal action on the part of the patient. I am considerably worried, first, as to how the patient gets at his documents in a case like this to prove it; and then, as to whom it is he makes responsible, if he can build up a case of improper detention. It is very difficult, we know, but it is one thing to say it is difficult and it is another to say it cannot be done at all. I should like my right hon. and learned Friend to look at this matter very closely indeed in connection with this Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will gladly look at the point to which my hon. Friend has referred. I think it would, perhaps, not be appropriate for me to make any further observations on this Amendment than that, because, of course, the principle of it is really the same as that we already discussed on 26th February; that is to say, the effect of this Amendment would be to give to the tribunals administrative functions which would be inconsistent with their proper appellate functions. I will certainly consider the matter which my hon. Friend asked me to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. and learned Friend gives the assurance that he will look at this point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked by one or two people whether the "fresh medical recommendation" referred to at the beginning of subsection (2, <i>a</i>) means a fresh medical recommendation from the same doctor who signed the original one or from another one.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no material doubt but that the hon.

—(APPLICATION FOR GUARDIANSHIP.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 20, line 19, to leave out "mental illness or".<br><br>
I am motivated, in moving this Amendment, after scrutiny of this Clause, and the whole of the procedure in this Clause, by certain cases within my own experience. One appreciates the general worth of this Clause in regard to cases of psychopathic disorder and severe sub-normality. I do not think any question arises there about the worth of this guardianshipl procedure. I think in regard to mental illness it is another matter and I should like my right hon. and learned Friend to look at the whole procedure carefully in the light of what I have to say.<br><br>
I think we have to be extremely careful in this type of legislation not to give too much incentive to unscrupulous people to take action in which, in one way or another, they may gain power over relatives or inconvenient people. In this case it would be a matter of gaining power over their affairs by a guardianship procedure. One does find or has found as a matter of experience, that the words "mental illness" do on occasion tend to be interpreted very widely indeed.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
I can think of one case where a man who was quite normal, to my mind—he wrote most intelligent letters, but was just slightly eccentric—lived with his stepmother, and they had a sort of domestic war against each other, which ended in his sprinkling water over her kitchen. It was very eccentric behaviour, perhaps. She went round to the mental health officer, and this man was certified and removed to hospital for a number of weeks until a brother got him out. I remember what the brother said to me. He came to me protesting, and he said that if this sort of thing happened we might as well go round certifying all antiquarian book dealers.<br><br>
Let us consider a slightly eccentric antiquarian book dealer with quite a nice prosperous business, and an enterprising son or daughter, or someone such as that, who would like to gain control of the business. They produce evidence of eccentric behaviour, perhaps are successful as the relatives in this case, and then they can come to the court and get guardianship over the book dealer's affairs.<br><br>
I feel that, once that is generally known, there is a risk to elderly and slightly eccentric people, who, perhaps, have some property over which enterprising and unscrupulous relatives would like to get control. I should like to be quite satisfied, and I should like my right hon. and learned Friend to satisfy himself, that this procedure which is described in this and following Clauses does not lay itself open to undesirable enterprises of that kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Moyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to ask the hon. Member for Carlisle (Dr. D. Johnson) what is the point of eliminating these words "mental illness or" in subsection (1, <i>a</i> (i)), when he appears to have no objection to retaining them in the first line of paragraph (<i>a</i>). I should have thought that, in the interests of his own desire for adequate safeguard, the words "mental illness or", which specify the mental disorder, were really in his own cause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had very definite reasons because, of course, many mental disorders do include psychopathic disorder or severe subnormality for which, as I expressly stated when I moved the Amendment, this is a reasonable pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
cedure. I just wanted to express my doubts about its use in cases of mental illness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The general answer, of course, to my hon. Friend's inquiry as to the safeguards and so on is that here we have under these guardianship provisions the same safeguards in effect, definitions and so on, that we had in regard to detention in hospitals, which we have debated at considerable length and thoroughness in the earlier stages of this Bill, including, as my hon. Friend will see if he looks ahead, the right to apply to a mental health tribunal under Clause 34 (5). That being so, it would, of course, be unfortunate to give effect to an Amendment such as this which would delete the "mentally ill" condition from the scope of guardianship.<br><br>
There is, as the Committee may know, some provision for the equivalent of guardianship under the present law; and it is capable, I think, of useful expansion in the future, in particular in these two ways. It should enable some people who have previously had to be dealt with as in-patients to be dealt with in the future as out-patients or day-patients, because they would be living with somebody who would be able to exercise a general control over their living conditions and so on.<br><br>
The other possibility which I see in particular is in respect of after-care, which my hon. Friend will agree is very important. It concerns the case of a patient who is on his way back to full rehabilitation but has not as yet achieved it; or, indeed, a chronic patient who has received the full benefit he can from his hospital treatment but is able to live in the community if, but only if, he is under some appropriate degree of control of his general living conditions. There, again, guardianship is, so to speak, tailor-made for that particular condition of mental illness.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will agree, and the Committee will agree, that it would be a retrograde step to eliminate "mental illness" from the scope of guardianship, because it would in fact run counter to the general principle that underlies much that we are thinking of in this matter; that is to say, a shift of emphasis away from institutional treatment to care in the community. So I hope that on that point my hon. Friend will see fit to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

Having had the opportunity of doing that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

—(CORRESPONDENCE OF PATIENTS.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 22, line 27, to leave out subsection (1).<br><br>
I wonder, Mr. Storey, whether it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we discussed together this Amendment and my next Amendment, to leave out subsection (2). I ask this because I should like to deploy the case against censorship as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be more convenient for the Committee's purposes if we discussed the first Amendment by itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This places me in a difficulty. I wish to deploy the case against censorship as a whole and it is not appropriately done on the first Amendment. The more serious censorship takes place under subsection (2). I should like you to reconsider your decision, Mr. Storey. If you are not willing for the general question to be discussed under this heading, I would propose not to press the first Amendment but to move my second Amendment and vote against the Clause as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should either take this matter on the first Amendment or discuss the whole general matter on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are always in this difficulty in Committee, that we discuss the detail first and the principle afterwards. I was seeking a method by which we might discuss the principle first. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
might then not be necessary to discuss the detail and the Committee's time might be saved. It was solely in order to save time that I suggested this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we know, the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) is well versed in legitimate ingenuity in framing his speeches. I should have thought it not impossible for him to deploy his general observations on censorship on his first Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With that encouragement from the right hon. and learned Gentleman, and in anticipation of your tolerance, Mr. Storey, perhaps I may proceed with the Amendment.<br><br>
My intention in seeking to leave out the subsection stems from my strong objection to censorship in principle. I believe that it is an objection which will be sustained by everybody in the Committee. I think that everyone agrees that censorship of any kind is undesirable, and censorship of correspondence in particular. There are circumstances in which it can be justified. These, however, are very few and the justification has to be extremely strong to overcome the basic principle.<br><br>
My second proposition is that if there is censorship it should be at least effective in doing what it sets out 'to do. Muddled, haphazard censorship is surely worse than no censorship at all. I hope that I carry the Committee with me that far. The Clause goes a good deal further than the Royal Commission on the Law Relating to Mental Illness and Mental Deficiency meant to go. There is no censorship whatever of incoming letters at the moment, and this was one of the points which the Royal Commission made. Therefore, the proposal to censor incoming mail, although the reasons might be quite valid, is entirely new. The Royal Commission said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hospital authorities should have authority to withhold from patients any incoming letters which it would harm them to receive…."</p></blockquote>
That is embodied in subsection (1).<br><br>
The Commission goes on to say that there should be no censorship of outgoing letters from patients, except at the request of individual addressees who ask that letters addressed to them should be withheld. Therefore, that was the only thing the Royal Commission wanted. In this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
Clause, therefore, there is a whole number of circumstances which would justify the resident medical officer in withholding letters.<br><br>
How is this practice to be carried out if we leave the Clause as it stands? There are, of course, very strong administrative difficulties in censorship in mental hospitals. The more open the hospital the greater the difficulty. In the old days it was very easy. A post-box was strategically placed in the hospital, inside or outside a ward. Patients went outside the hospital only under strict supervision and one could be sure that any letters that they wrote would have to be put in the hospital letterbox. Now the great majority of patients are free to go out of the hospital whenever they wish and when they want to post a letter they can post it in the village. Patients who are difficult and who for the time being are not allowed to go out of the hospital can get their letters posted by other patients who are able to go out. It would require only the minimum ingenuity on the part of any patient in the hospital to get round any censorship of outgoing mail. That is the view taken by a large number of medical superintendents at the moment.<br><br>
A week or two ago I had the opportunity of joining in the discussion at a refresher course for medical superintendents held in London. I asked what happened at the moment. I found that even under the comparatively illiberal regime which this Bill tries to sweep away, five of them have no kind of censorship in their hospitals. I asked about the case of the addressee who does not want to receive letters from a certain patient. They all said that when somebody says that he does not want to receive any more letters the medical officer goes to the patient and nine times out of ten is able to persuade that patient to desist. Are we to construct the whole unpleasant apparatus of censorship to deal with this tiny minority of cases, when we know that it cannot deal effectively even with them?<br><br>
Administratively, all medical superintendents regard this as a tiresome burden. "An infernal nuisance" one of them described it to me the other day. They do not want these powers. Certainly none of them suggested that there would be any objection if censorship were abolished entirely. None of the medical superintendents of mental hospitals
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
wanted it. Two superintendents of mental deficiency hospitals thought that on balance it might be a good thing to have reserve powers but said that they would not be unduly upset if the powers were removed.<br><br>
Censorship cannot be exercised in a mental hospital without the power to examine all letters. How can it be done if it is desired to censor the letters only of patients A, B, C and D? Their letters are not collected separately. Are they to be asked to write their names and addresses on the backs of the envelopes and are only their letters to be picked out for censorship? If they wanted to overcome the censorship it would be the easiest thing in the world to write somebody else's name and address on the back of the envelope. It might be said that the handwriting could be picked out, but what a ridiculous thing to ask a medical superintendent of a busy hospital to do in these days.<br><br>
The appalling thing is that it is proposed under Clause 131 to give power of censorship over the letters of informal patients. The Royal Commission's Report and the Bill are designed to further the idea of the minimum difference between mental patients and those suffering from physical illness. Whereas the Bill seeks to make a complete informality of the reception of patients suffering from mental disorders, it adds that they will be told that all their letters will be opened by the doctors who are treating them. I cannot think of anything more likely to deter somebody from going to a hospital for the informal treatment of mental disorder than saying that the patient's letters will be opened. The ability to read private letters without having had them opened and examined by somebody else is a pretty fundamental right. Why should people forgo that basic human freedom because they are going to a hospital and are suffering from mental rather than physical disorder?<br><br>
There is, of course, something logical in having this apply to both informal and formal patients, because the Bill is to provide that they are to be in the same hospital and, I sincerely hope, in the same ward. Therefore, if we are asking for censorship powers over compulsory patients we cannot exercise it unless we have powers to open the letters of informal patients. I do not suppose that anybody will support the idea that the letters
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0222">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
of informal patients should be censored. Once that is admitted, it is administratively impossible to have censorship at all.<br><br>
In any event, I do not believe it is necessary. I do not believe that medical superintendents and psychiatrists would do anything but welcome its abolition. The R.M.P.A. has told us that it is a little divided on this issue. There is no doubt that a few superintendents who are living in the past regard the censorship of letters as one of those things which they automatically do and cannot see how they will get along without it. I believe, however, that if the Minister circulated these hospitals throughout the country he would find that the great majority are not exercising censorship and that even those which do exercise it do so on a cursory and inefficient basis.<br><br>
We must have second thoughts about this. This Clause and Clause 131 go infinitely further than the Royal Commission recommended. Nevertheless, if we are to have censorship it is difficult to see how we can go less far than the Clause. The logical outcome of this whole argument is that there is no longer any case for censorship of patients' letters, either incoming or outgoing. One cannot tell what incoming letters will harm a patient without opening every incoming letter addressed to any patient who might be thought to be harmed by the receipt of such a letter. There again, quite apart from the moral side of the question, we are placing a totally inappropriate and excessive administrative burden on busy medical officers.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will think again about this matter. The National Association for Mental Health is quite categorically against censorship. It is not often that I call in aid the Bow Group, but it, too, has expressed its complete opposition to censorship. As far as I can see, there would be no strong objection from any quarter in the mental hospital service if these provisions were entirely wiped out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) deployed his arguments against censorship most convincingly, but he may not have done the best service to the Com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
mittee by using the word "censorship". I should be absolutely with him if it were a question of censorship as such, but the intention behind the provision is not that of censorship.<br><br>
I find myself in some difficulty. The Committee is divided into two parties, for there are two fundamentally different ways of regarding the Bill. One party is the party of individual liberty, first, last, and all the time. The other party is the party of the protection of the public and the treatment of the patient, first, last, and all the time. Most hon. Members are in the same position as I in their attitude to these two parties in that they "cross the Floor" fairly regularly. I do not know on which side I find myself most unhappy.<br><br>
The difficulty has been put to us in an acute form, but the hon. Member overlooked one cardinal point, that the Clause is permissive only. It provides that an authority "may" open incoming letters and "may" stop outgoing letters. It does not say that it "shall" do so. It is therefore not a matter of censorship, but an instrument of treatment which might be helpful.<br><br>
So far as I am disposed to support and strengthen this part of the Clause, I am primarily moved by the fact that if we do not have these provisions, it will be illegal and give the right of action against a medical officer if, in the path of his duty, he follows a certain course. I doubt whether psychiatrists would willingly forgo the power given to them by the Clause. Nor do I believe that if they had to forgo it they would willingly risk putting themselves on the wrong side of the law by intercepting correspondence.<br><br>
We should leave these provisions as they stand, because this absolute parallelism between physical and mental illness can be pressed a little too far. There is a difference between them and between the kinds of treatment suitable. The difference is that in the treatment of mental illness there is placed on the treater, the doctor, the duty of getting into the mind, heart and soul of the patient and getting his complete confidence, to some extent even using subterfuges which would not be acceptable in normal human relationships.<br><br>
I do not see how one can get over that. A psychiatrist has to be given a certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0223">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
right of approach to his patient which would not be acceptable if that person were not his patient but a person with whom he had to deal as a normal human being on a level of complete mental equality. There is something in the very nature of mental illness which makes it necessary for the psychiatrist to deal with a patient on a slightly privileged level.<br><br>
We ought to allow the psychiatrist in his judgment to have access to the mind and thought of his patient, and that could be given by access to his correspondence. We should also give him the opportunity to co-operate with the family of the patient in a way which would require or make it convenient for him to have access to the patient's correspondence.<br><br>
The doctor dealing with a mental patient is not concerned with that patient alone. He is concerned with the patient and the patient's family and the patient's whole relationship to the community outside and to those closest to him. It should be possible for a doctor to tell a patient, "Do not say these things to your family; do not say these things to your friends or relations outside". It should be possible at certain times to see that those things are not said or heard. We are giving to the psychiatrist only the right to exercise that authority if and when in his judgment he thinks it necessary. We have not said to the psychiatrist, "If you fail to exercise this power you will not be carrying out your duties under the Bill".<br><br>
We should be wary of denying to the healer one avenue of approach to his attempted cure which he might welcome and might need. With great respect to the hon. Member, in accepting the principle of what he called, wrongly as I think, censorship, we are not committing an offence against the individual liberty of normal people. Rather are we putting ready to hand for those doctors who need it a method of treatment which they might find helpful. Although I go all the way with the hon. Member on censorship as such, I think it best to leave the Clause as it is, since I believe that it does not impose a censorship, but merely gives a permissive power which might be helpful and useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Member reads paragraph 299 of the Royal Commission Report which talks about the censorship of letters and which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
says that the power of censorship of outgoing mail should be limited to those cases where the recipient asks that the letters should be stopped. It is nothing to do with the treatment of the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coldrick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of us will agree with my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) on the principle of granting all possible liberty to a patient to write or receive letters, but I do not find it possible to go all the way with him on this Amendment. It is a little inconsistent that he should argue, as he has frequently done, that we should entrust to the medical superintendent and the medial practitioner the right to decide whether a person should be admitted to treatment and thereby have his general liberties restricted, while at the same time arguing that we ought not to entrust to the medical profession the responsibility of saying whether letters received by a patient would be detrimental to his form of treatment. If some people are given the right to curtail a man's freedom, it is inconsistent that they should not be given the right to curtail a limited freedom, a right which is insignificant compared with the main power with which they are entrusted.<br><br>
From my limited experience, I know perfectly well that in certain cases in Bristol some people unfortunately in mental homes suffer from grave hallucinations. In consequence, some of the letters which they send out cause great distress to the recipients. I have met people who have done all they can to prevent the receipt of those letters. It is not uncommon for some of those letters to be addressed to the employer of the daughter, or son, as the case may be. In such cases a grave injury can be done by the person writing the letter, who, however, is not fundamentally responsible for what he does.<br><br>
We must allow doctors to exercise commonsense and discretion. No medical officer or superintendent would be worth the position he occupied if he went through every letter received by or sent out from the hospital. A doctor dealing with a patient over a number of years will get to know the sort of letters he writes and receives, and be in a position to use his discretion.<br><br>
I know of one person who is incarcerated in a mental home and for whom it is a delight each Christmas to spend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0224">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
about £10 writing to all the people who have ever visited him, but it is well known that the letters which he sends are always harmless and the medical officer never imposes what my hon. Friend calls a censorship. He uses discretion. On the other hand, there are those who send out letters which are always offensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is getting on to the next subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coldrick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we could argue the general principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: General principle, but not detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coldrick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have said all that I needed to say on that issue.<br><br>
We should not assume that those people to whom we are entrusting the curtailment of the liberty of people are so sinister that they will do something inimical to the interests of patients. I shall require much more evidence than has yet been adduced if I am to support the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austen Albu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger) was somewhat unfair to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) in suggesting that he was one of those who put the civil liberties of the patient above the treatment of the patient and the protection of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I said that there were two parties and that we all "crossed the Floor" fairly regularly and that I did not know where I was most unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all in that position, especially with this Clause.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-East (Mr. Coldrick) and the hon. Member overlooked the fact that a substantial change has taken place in the method of treatment and the character of hospitals. My hon. Friend, who brought a strong body of psychiatric opinion in support of his Amendment, made it perfectly clear that in modern hospitals and under modern conditions it will be extremely difficult to operate such a control of correspondence, whether ingoing or outgoing. Many patients are able to walk about fairly freely outside the hospital and have a great deal of contact with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
members of the public, visitors, and so on. There is no doubt that the subsection involves considerable censorship, and it will be extremely difficult not to have a fairly wide censorship if the subsection is to mean anything.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ilford, North referred to the psychiatric need and the importance of the doctor-patient relationship in mental cases as justifying these powers. The body of his argument was that the powers were concerned not so much with the inconvenience and distress which might be caused to persons outside, as with the treatment of the patient and the need for the psychiatrists to be, as it were, on the inside of the patient's correspondence. The hon. Gentleman mentioned access to the patient's correspondence and access to his family.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I cannot see the need for censorship. A good psychiatrist ought to be able to get access both to correspondence and to the patient's family because of the relationship he has managed to establish with the patient. Censorship might be harmful to the treatment, if the patient knew that the psychiatrist had compulsory access to his correspondence. It should not be beyond the wit of a good psychiatrist to obtain the names of people who are writing to a patient in ways which are harmful.<br><br>
Hon. Members have spoken of domiciliary treatment, and of the importance of keeping in touch with the patient's family, visiting the family, and taking care that harm is not caused to the patient by the receipt of certain types of letter. All that is very valuable. It might operate the other way round, where people are objecting to receiving correspondence from the patient. The psychiatrist could deal with this matter in discussion with the patient and get him to co-operate by not writing that correspondence.<br><br>
The main argument against the power which the subsection gives is that when the patient goes into the hospital he knows that that power exists. It might be difficult to distinguish between formal patients and those admitted under the voluntary procedure, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North pointed out, but the patient still knows
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
that his correspondence may be interfered with. This is what makes such a sharp break with the practice in ordinary hospitals.<br><br>
We do not interfere with correspondence in cases of tuberculosis and fever, although such patients are also admitted under compulsory powers. One has, to some extent, to remove the liberty of patients, but that is no argument for increasing the amount of liberty which one removes in the case of mental patients. The less one can make the stay in hospital appear like a prison sentence the better. One should make the patient feel that once the admission procedure is over he is a patient in the ordinary sense. The hon. Member for Ilford, North says that mental patients are not quite the same. Nevertheless, one does not want to add restrictions of liberty if they are not necessary.<br><br>
My own view is powerfully affected by the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North about the influence of psychiatrists and mental superintendents in these hospitals, and by what I know about the methods of psychiatric treatment, by which I think the problem could be dealt with. The danger may well be that if we allow the Clause to go through as it is we shall hinder the advance of psychiatric treatment, because this wording may provide an easier way of dealing with the problem than the more difficult way of psychiatric treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. L. Mallalieu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been tremendously impressed by the arguments put forward by my hon. Friends the Members for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) and Edmonton (Mr. Albu). Having, of course, a strong prejudice against anything which smacks of censorship, I was perhaps receptive to their arguments, which they put forward extremely cogently. I wonder whether the medical evidence which is said to be arrayed against this subsection is slightly influenced by the fact that those who give it say that this is a censorship.<br><br>
I come down, on a balance of advantage in this instance, on the side of the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger). It is, of course, a balance of advantage. Are we to say—this is what impresses me most—that if a medical man in charge of a patient says,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
"I think it is in the interests of my patient not to have certain correspondence" he may not, if he can easily, and without administrative difficulty, prevent the patient from having that correspondence? When letters come to the hospital it might be quite easy for the medical man to distinguish at once the letters which he thinks are objectionable for his patient. There might be no administrative difficulty at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. and learned Friend suggesting that it will be possible to do this without opening the letters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am saying that. It might well be possible, not with the first letter, but with subsequent letters; there might be a series of letters. The medical officer might have been shown the letters by the patient and would know what was going on. He could intercept this correspondence. Are we to say in these cases, that although the medical man thinks it is in the interests of his patient that the correspondence should be intercepted, he is not to do it? I find that difficult to accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. and learned Friend aware that the disastrous situation that he thinks might follow if my Amendment were accepted does in fact exist today there and has always existed? Does he not appreciate that there is now no legal power to intercept correspondence from patients in mental hospitals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of it, but I could not care less. I am interested in what is best for the future. The argument should give us pause in taking away the permissive power of the medical man to exercise this function in the interests of his patient.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North referred to the doctor-patient relationship. The mere fact that this permissive power is in the Bill might have an influence on the minds of patients who know about it. A great many people will not know what is in the Bill, but this provision might affect very considerably the patient who did know, and it might have a bad effect on his relationship with his doctor. I grant that, but that can be mitigated in certain circumstances by the doctor, who would see that it would not have this bad effect. He would say, "It is not in the interests of my patient to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0226">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
do anything that the Clause permits me to do," and he might make it plain to the patient that no one would do any such thing. On balance, I come down on the side of allowing this power to remain in the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Dodds</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu) can see that there are two sides to this question but he comes down on balance of advantage on the side of the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger). Whoever wishes to retain the subsection can make out a very good case, but there is also a very good case why we should get rid of it.<br><br>
On balance, I support my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson), who made out a pretty good case, particularly about what we hope for in the future. I am all against censorship. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Brigg said he was interested in the future. If people are to go into mental hospitals we want them to do so informally, but they would be against doing so if they knew there were permissive powers to look at their correspondence. Outgoing censorship has been mentioned but—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member can deal with the matter in principle but must not go into detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodds</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not going into detail, Mr. Storey, except to say that I doubt whether anybody in the Committee or in the House gets as many letters as I do from patients in mental hospitals. I get them by every post, and I am still getting them. What amazes me is that most of the people who write to me are not allowed out to post their letters. They get them posted, and the currency payment for getting letters posted to a Member of Parliament is in cigarettes. Patients can get letters out without censorship if they are prepared to pay in cigarettes.<br><br>
Subsection (1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any postal packet addressed to a patient detained in a hospital under this Part of this Act may be withheld from the patient".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-East (Mr. Coldrick) seemed to feel that when we entrust people with this kind of censorship they carry it out with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
common sense and that we do not need to worry about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coldrick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggested that if we were prepared to entrust medical officers with the curtailment of people's major liberties might we not feel disposed to trust them with the minor power, suggested in the Bill, to use their discretion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodds</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am dealing with the question of correspondence, whether that argument is valid or not.<br><br>
My hon. Friend went on to say that if we trusted them in that way we could feel sure, unless there should be evidence to the contrary, that they would use those powers with common sense. I have not as much faith as my hon. Friend has. I should like to show how the power can be abused.<br><br>
I was, and still am, particularly interested in a patient at Rampton who had been there for thirteen years. I made two visits to talk to this patient with a view to getting the material I needed for fighting his case. The patient, I might say, is doing splendidly now. Those two visits to Rampton were very costly to me. After I saw the patient the second time I said, "I will be writing to you". On 28th August I wrote to that patient, following the visit in July. That letter was addressed to the patient, in an envelope with "House of Commons" large on the back. I was surprised, three weeks later, to hear that the patient had run away. That is a very big crime for a patient who wants freedom. In the beginning of October I had occasion to go to the Board of Control, and there was my letter, which I had written on 28th August.<br><br>
I am very pleased that in subsection (1) there is a provision that
<br><blockquote><p>"any packet so withheld shall, if the name and address of the sender are sufficiently identified therein, be returned to him by post."</p></blockquote>
I had gone to the Board of Control on something which had nothing to do with that case, and I was astonished to find that my letter had not gone to the patient at all. It had been stopped by the medical superintendent and had been returned to the Board of Control, where I found it five weeks later. As a consequence, the patient felt that I had let him down. He lost faith and ran out of the hospital.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
12 noon.<br><br>
If my hon. Friend wants to entrust this business to the same people he has more faith than I. I would say that, on balance, it is better to get rid of censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) took full advantage of your tolerance, Mr. Storey, in enabling him to deploy the case in regard to censorship as a whole, albeit the Amendment covers only supervision of the incoming correspondence to the patient. I think the Committee would be at one in being instinctively averse to the procedures of censorship in all normal and avoidable cases. I do not think any of us would yield to the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North in that regard, but what we are concerned with here is whether in the specific and somewhat unusual circumstances with which we are dealing it is right that some provision should be made.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said there was no censorship now, and repeated that in an intervention in the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu). That is true so far as mental hospitals are concerned, but we are not dealing here only with mental hospitals. He did not see fit to refer to the existing procedures in regard to mental deficiency hospitals or State institutions. Under Regulation 45 of the Mental Deficiency Regulations, 1948, there is power to read and withhold incoming correspondence as well as outgoing correspondence if the contents are objectionable or if the medical superintendent thinks that intercourse between the patient and the correspondent is undesirable. So far as Broadmoor is concerned, under the 1952 Rules the medical superintendent must inspect all incoming and outgoing mail. I refer to this case because this is not a provision dealing solely with cases of mental illness. It is covering the whole range of mental disorder, what is known as mental deficiency as well as mental illness, and the State institutions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman put a good deal of emphasis on the administrative implications. He said that it is a tiresome burden administratively and an infernal nuisance. I have many administrative duties; some of them constitute a tiresome burden and it may be that in less formal moments I am even tempted to describe some of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
them as an infernal nuisance; but it does not follow that it is not right to discharge them. This is administratively viable and no one could say that it is not administratively possible to exercise this responsibility. Reference was made to the Royal Commission and I would refer my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger), who made a very thoughtful and balanced contribution to this discussion, to paragraph 299 of the Royal Commission Report:
<br><blockquote><p>As regards the censorship of letters, we recommend that there should be no censorship of out-going letters from patients (whether subject to detention or not) except at the request of individual addressees who ask for letters addressed to themselves to be scrutinised or withheld because they find them distressing. The hospital authorities should have authority to withhold from patients any incoming letters which it would harm them to receive, but this power should be very sparingly used; we should expect it to be restricted in practice to those severely sub-normal or psychopathic patients who may need to be protected from malicious or other upsetting correspondence from relatives or others who may have been opposed to their admission to hospital. Whenever a letter is withheld from a patient, it should be returned to the writer.</p></blockquote>
The use of the word "psychopathic" includes what we call subnormal.<br><br>
I will come in the next Amendment to the reasons why it is necessary to add to the recommendations in respect of the outgoing correspondence, although I hope I shall show, when we come to the detailed Amendments, that I have an open and receptive mind on this, but so far as incoming mail is concerned it is clear that the Commission does regard it as necessary in the patient's own interest. I agree that it should be very sparingly used. It is clear that the subsection does not require all incoming correspondence to be read. This is a permissive power and permits the responsible medical officer to read letters to individual patients, and when desirable to withhold those within the terms of the subsection. I do not suppose for a moment that he would be reading all incoming correspondence but would use his common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He would have to read all the incoming mail of those patients who, he thought, might be upset by certain types of correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that it would be confined to a minority of patients, who, he had reason
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
to think, might be upset by correspondence, and that it would in practice be confined, at any rate after some experience, to those letters which were known to have an upsetting effect on the patient.<br><br>
I do not see that the administrative difficulties are as strong as the hon. Gentleman suggested but if this Amendment were accepted, it would prevent this altogether, in State institutions and hospitals as well. The responsible medical officer who sought to do it in the interests of the patient might face an action in the courts. The sort of letters we have in mind are letters from relatives or other people who were opposed to the patient's admission to hospital, and who might write to the patient urging him not to co-operate in his treatment. It could even include the nearest relative who had been displaced from his position by the county court under Clause 52. If the Amendment were accepted he could write urging the patient not to co-operate, and disturbing him in that way. We might get letters urging the patient to leave hospital without permission, and in the case of State institutions or patients transferred by the courts, there might be letters suggesting arrangements and ways in which the patient might escape in an unauthorised way. Letters also could contain accusations against the patient, which would be upsetting to the mentally disordered, or letters suggesting undesirable assignations with female patients either within or without the hospital grounds. All these are cases where the letters should be withheld, but they are a minority, and this is only a permissive power. That is all I should properly say on this Amendment, although I shall have something further to say on later stages of this Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. A. D. D. Broughton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the Minister has emphasised that this does not impose a duty of censorship of letters by the medical officer, but is permissive. I hope the Committee will keep this subsection in the Clause to cover the action of the responsible medical officer when he considers it necessary to withhold correspondence from certain patients.<br><br>
Supervision of correspondence is a duty which is carried out in mental hospitals at the present time by the nursing staff. What happens is that the letters are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
brought to the ward, and handed to the sister in charge, and she passes them to the patients. She knows her patients very well indeed, and in a short space of time she knows from whom the letters are coming. In nine cases out of ten the patient will tell the sister from whom the letter has been sent. In five cases out of ten they will hand the letter to the sister to read herself. So the nursing staff know in nearly all instances from whom the letters are being sent. Because they know their patients and watch them and study them, they can see the effect of the correspondence on the patient.<br><br>
I have known cases of women patients of mine who have been very upset by the receipt of letters from relatives, particularly from husbands, who have written and told them that they should either discharge themselves from hospital or escape, because the husband is very selfish indeed and wishes to have the wife at home when, in the opinion of the medical and nursing staff, the patient is not fit to go. The receipt of such letters can be very disturbing and distressing to a patient.<br><br>
I think it is only right in those circumstances—and I agree with the Minister entirely when he says that the number of cases will be very few indeed—that the responsible medical officer should have the power to withhold the correspondence, and it should not be possible for legal action to be taken against him.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Albu) said he thought that these letters which are sent to patients and cause so much distress could be prevented by a psychiatrist approaching the relations. That is by no means always possible. The letters may be sent by a relative who will not come for interview. My hon. Friend also mentioned the possibility of the social worker contacting the person writing the letters which were having such an ill effect on the patient. Unfortunately, there are many mental hospitals which have no social workers. There is a great shortage of social workers in the country. So for one reason or another it is often impossible for the psychiatrist to contact the person who is sending the letter. Even if it were always possible then, of course, the person sending the letter may take no notice at all of what the psychiatrist advises.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
As the Minister and others have said, we are all anxious to preserve and protect the freedom of the individual as far as it is possible, but I hope that the Committee will keep this subsection in the Clause so that these permissive powers may be used on those rare occasions when, in the opinion of the responsible medical officer, they are necessary for the patient's good.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that my feelings about this subsection are less strong than they are about subsection (2). They always have been. My objections to this subsection are simply the general objections I have to censorship in principle, and I am still not satisfied that the powers conferred are essential. Of course, they are permissive powers; they are not a duty but as more than one of my hon. Friends have pointed out, it is the existence of permissive powers which will become known, and it is a fact that patients will know that letters coming to them may not be freely received, which in some cases undoubtedly will have a detrimental effect.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I agree that under this subsection administratively the supervision or censorship, or whatever we like to call it, is easier. The same objections under the next subsection are not valid. It is also something which is done in a much more open and aboveboard manner. The letter is withheld, and then it is returned to the sender. That is different from what happens when a letter is withheld from the outgoing mail.<br><br>
But the Minister must not come to this Committee and justify Clauses in this Bill which affect the ordinary liberties of mental patients on the basis that they are appropiate for the State institutions. This is not good enough. I believe we are getting into great difficulties over persons in State institutions. I said on Second Reading that many, indeed most, of us were not clear exactly how far this Bill affects the State institutions. I think the time is approaching when the Minister might tell us. I should like to know before we come to Part VII of the Bill.<br><br>
It is obvious that provisions of this kind which may be appropriate for Broadmoor and State institutions, are wholly inappropriate for the ordinary mentally disordered patient in an ordinary mental hospital and, <i>a fortiori</i>, for the patient
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
in what may be a general hospital. Therefore, I am not impressed by any arguments connected with the State institutions about people making arrangements to escape. If that is so, then special provisions must be made to cover the State institutions. But that argument cannot be used as a justification for restricting the liberties and freedom of average people as the Minister has tried to do today.<br><br>
However, as my objections are much less strong to this subsection than to the others, in the circumstances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 22, line 28, after "be", to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"opened by the responsible medical officer and".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can discuss with this the hon. Member's next Amendment, in page 22, line 30, after "receipt", insert "or contents".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I need detain the Committee for only one moment. It does not seem to me to make any sense that the medical officer shall have the right to withhold correspondence on the ground that it "would be calculated to interfere with the treatment of the patient" and so on, unless he is allowed to open it. The mere receipt may not necessarily be distressing: it is what is in it. The difficulty has been put to me that the responsible medical officer might well feel that the Bill, as at present drafted, allows him to withhold but not to open a letter. If we are to have any power at all I should have thought we wanted to go the whole way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is, of course, quite right that the power to open letters must be exercisable if the functions of the Clause are to be discharged. I am advised that the power to open, which his Amendment would make explicit, is already implicit in the wording of the Bill. In this connection, he will see that the concluding words of subsection (5) are
<br><blockquote><p>"…and the provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything in section fifty-six of that Act."</p></blockquote>
That is the Post Office Act, 1953. Section 56 of the Post Office Act makes it an offence for any person other than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0230">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
the parent or guardian of the person to whom a postal packet is addressed to open or cause to be opened any postal packet in the course of transmission. By making that not apply to this, I think it strengthens the implication that there is power to open. So the short answer to my hon. Friend is that his Amendment is not required to affect the purpose which he very properly has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With that explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 22, line 35, to leave out subsection (2).<br><br>
In view of your tolerance, Mr. Storey, on the last Amendment I shall not take up very much time in moving this Amendment. Most of the arguments against censorship of outgoing mail, or withholding it, or whatever euphemistic term the Committee prefers, I dealt with on my last Amendment. I want only to emphasise on this occasion the very considerable extension which the Bill envisages over the recommendation of the Royal Commission. The Minister has frequently pleaded the Royal Commission, and I think in all cases successfully, as an argument for resisting Amendments, but here is an occasion where he has gone very much further than the Royal Commission suggested. It merely says that letters addressed to individual Addressees who ask them to be scrutinised and withheld should be able to be withheld. We appreciate the motives which led to that recommendation.<br><br>
At the same time I think that if this whole move forward, this liberalisation of the law relating to mental illness, is to be realised, a certain price has got to be paid; and although there may be cases Where it is extremely distressing for people in the community outside to get certain types of letter from a mental hospital patient, I still think that that is not sufficient argument for inflicting on all mental patients the possibility, at any rate, that their letters will be opened by the medical or nursing staffs or clerical staff of the hospital.<br><br>
I repeat what I was told by more than one medical superintendent, that in nearly all cases it is possible to persuade a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
patient not to write letters to an individual who has asked not to receive them. That is a far better way of dealing with this matter.<br><br>
I want only to add one other point. Having told the Committee some of the subterfuges by which patients could get round any kind of censorship regulations of this kind, I should like to add only one other thing, and that is that there is the telephone. There is no power in this Bill to stop patients using the telephone. In all up to date mental hospitals there are telephones available for all patients, and if they want to be distressing, and if they are provoked by censorship to do it in some other way than by correspondence, they will not hesitate to use the telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Storey, we had, due to your tolerance, a fairly full debate on the general principles regarding this matter on the hon. Gentleman's last Amendment. Of course, here we are in a different position, as he will appreciate, because in respect of outgoing correspondence in both mental and mental deficiency hospitals at the present time there is a full discretion to withhold outgoing letters, except letters to certain named persons; that is corresponding to, though not identical with, the exceptions we have in the Bill. We have improved upon the exceptions, as the Committee knows.<br><br>
It is true to say, as appears from my reading of paragraph 299 of the Royal Commission's Report on the last Amendment, that the Royal Commission specified restriction only at the request of the individual addressee. We have adopted that, and have added to it, "offensiyeness to the addressee". There is no doubt, of course, that there are many letters written which are calculated to be offensive to the addressees, as I think was made clear in the interesting speech of the hon. Member the Member for Bristol, North-East (Mr. Coldrick) on the preceding Amendment. There are letters, for example, which contain groundless allegations against the addressee or which violently reject his expressions of sympathy. There are letters containing groundless allegations about the patient himself, which are distressing, or may be, to a relative or friend. There are letters containing allegations about third parties, for example, allegations about a patient's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
wife and letters written to the children of the marriage; and then there are the letters which are incoherent and meaningless but which can also possibly afford distress.<br><br>
We have, of course, a certain amount of experience in the Ministry in regard to this subject, because letters written to the Minister are, under the present law, not withholdable. We also have experience, therefore, regarding both the State institutions and outside. If I may parenthetically so observe, the only point I was making on the State institutions on the last Amendment was that in fact the Amendment would have covered them as well. My arguments and all my examples, save one, apply in the much broader field.<br><br>
The sort of example we have is a letter to the patient's uncle—I think, to be fair, I should say it is a letter from a State institution—containing allegations that another person, evidently well known to the addressee, has committed murder, theft and bigamy. Then there is a letter accusing the patient's neighbours, by name, of being
<br><blockquote><p>"Vile monsters who have all told lies and framed me and others"</p></blockquote>
and describing the neighbours as liars and sex maniacs. Or, again, there are letters from patients accusing the local police, and members in the hospital; and a letter accusing the rector and his wife in the patient's home town, identifiable by name and address, of having conspired together to persecute and put away the patient, and describing the rector as a man with an extraordinary power of evil, for which the psychiatrists are no match, they being gullible psychiatric dupes and easy prey to any plausible rogue. [<i>Interruption</i>.] If the hon. Member were the rector would he wish to read such a letter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is pachydermatous in this context. We are all here pachydermatous. We take a different view; we are politicians. We have been accustomed for years to offensive observations about us. Other people are not the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodds</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are there thin-skinned rectors?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course there are. If the hon. Gentleman attends a place of worship he will know that the pulpit is very different from a political platform. There is no right of interjection or interruption there. In the House of Commons we take a different view. Hon. Members opposite say harsh things about me. Even the right hon. Lady the Member for Warrington (Dr. Summerskill) does so occasionally. I do not bear them any ill will, nor do I feel injured in my feelings. That is a long tradition of British politics, but other people are in a different position. They are not brought up in this tradition of being the recipients of harsh observations at all times. They are wounded by these things. The sooner the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) realises that point and that this is very different from the rough and tumble of political life the better will be his understanding of these problems.<br><br>
These letters tend to be repetitive, too. The last example I gave came into the Department every week. No doubt similar letters go regularly to many other people as well. If the Amendment were adopted, the recipient would have no redress however repetitive and cumulative these insulting letters were.<br><br>
Furthermore, all this time the hon. Member has not drawn the Committee's attention to the definition of a postal packet. Under subsection (5) it has the same meaning as in the Post Office Act, 1953, where it is defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"a letter, postcard, reply postcard …"</p></blockquote>
and so on. Therefore, postcards for all the world to see are part of the correspondence which the hon. Member would wish to go out, however offensive or defamatory the contents might be.<br><br>
Furthermore, offensive behaviour may well be a symptom of mental disorder taken into account in putting the patient into hospital, and it is frustrating the purpose of the treatment if he is allowed to continue the annoyance by corresp ondence.<br><br>
We all appreciate the hon. Member's motives and we are anxious to work this matter with as little rigour as possible, but we must look at it in the light of common sense and have regard to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0232">Image</span>

proper feelings and sensibilities of people outside as well as the interests of the patient. I hope, therefore, that we can reject this Amendment and pass to the succeeding specific Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said on the previous Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) that we all object to censorship in general or in most cases, or something like that, but do we? The right hon. and learned Gentleman is a member of a Government who are asking for £7 million more for the Secret Service, M.I.5, no doubt to indulge in further telephone tapping, the opening of correspondence and other excesses and absurdities of the security procedure. This does not seem the mark of a liberal outlook which would lead us to take exactly at their face value the words which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just addressed to the Committee.<br><br>
I did not speak on my hon. Friend's previous Amendment because, on balance, I was persuaded that it was in the interest of the patient that the medical officer responsible should have some power of discretion in the matter of incoming mail. The right hon. and learned Gentleman and other Members of the Committee have quite rightly catalogued a long list of offensive letters or postcards which could pass both ways, either from a patient to a person outside, which is the case under this Amendment, or, as we discussed previously, from a person outside to the patient. It is precisely when I consider the impact of such offensive correspondence that I come to the conclusion here that on balance the effect of denying the patient's right to send letters is likely to be more to his harm than to his good.<br><br>
When we were talking previously about the effect of the mail on a patient in a mental hospital, we were talking about somebody who admittedly was a sick person and, therefore, we were entitled to look closely at anything which might cause a deterioration in his or her health. But the recipient of the letter or postcard from the patient is assumed to be a normal person who is more likely to attach the appropriate weight to the missive when it comes from a mental hospital.<br><br>
In common with every hon. Member here, in the course of my Membership of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
the House of Commons I have received letters from people who are mentally ill. I recall one occasion when I received a letter from a soldier who was mentally ill and whose case I proceeded to take up, as we all do, with the Secretary of State for War. The soldier was subsequently denied the right to further correspond with me by a military medical officer. I recall that later the Secretary of State advised me that the man was not mentally ill and was not, as had been alleged, a schizophrenic. On the very day that letter arrived, my unfortunate constituent momentarily eluded his guards and cast himself out of a railway train and lost his life. I do not attach too much importance to this, but I have wondered subsequently how much his disordered mind was finally tipped by the denial undoubtedly imposed upon him of his right to communicate with me. We all know that such communications may in the end produce nothing of value to the patient, but it is at least arguable that that denial was in that case disastrous to the interests of the patient and his family. I say nothing, incidentally, of what appears to have been the rather absurd diagnosis by the specialist who was entrusted with the care of that man.<br><br>
Other people send us these letters. The Minister, no doubt, will say that under the proposals in the Bill they are not prevented from sending letters to individual Members of Parliament. I submit, however, that they should be so entitled to send them to any sympathetically-minded lay person outside. Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite follow the hon. Member when he says that they may be denied the right to write to sympathetically-minded individuals outside. It is only when the addressee requests that they should not be allowed to write to him, when the letters are offensive, that that is done. An ordinary letter to a sympathetically-minded individual would not come within these prohibitions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case I apologise, but I think that on balance there should be no censorship at all of a person's correspondence. I come to that conclusion for the precise reasons which the Minister advanced and which would have persuaded me to support him on my hon. Friend's previous Amendment. If my

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
hon. Friend chooses to take this Amendment to a Division I shall be inclined to support him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I expected a good deal more in the way of rebuttal of my case than the Minister gave to the Committee. He devoted most of his speech to describing the type of letter which might be sent and which has often been sent by mentally disordered persons. We are all Members of Parliament and we all know that. We all get these letters and it is obvious that they cause us less concern and distress than they do to people who are not politicians. We grant the Minister that.<br><br>
However, there are not many rectors who would be deeply distressed by a letter of the kind which the Minister read from a patient in a mental hospital. I hope that our clergy are a little more intelligent than the Minister has suggested. It is part of the disease, and so long as people know that the person is mentally disordered, most of them will take it from whence it comes, as the phrase goes. So I do not attach much importance to that.<br><br>
The Minister did not deal with the arguments which I deployed at such length that I am sure that the Committee got bored, on the administrative difficulties in operating censorship in a</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 22, line 38, to leave out from "packet" to "but" in line 42 and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"contains libellous matter concerning third parties, other than hospital staff, or information which may be detrimental to the patient".</p></blockquote>
I remind the Minister at the outset that he has looked at the Amendment Paper and said that he would have an open and receptive mind to an Amend-</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
<p>mental hospital today. It is perfectly simple for any patient to evade any kind of censorship if he wants to do so. That view is shared by people far better able than I to express a view about mental illness. I am told that it is much more likely that patients will write this sort of letter if they are legally not permitted to do so. In other words, if there is censorship and the possibility of letters being withheld, that fact alone, I have been assured by many psychiatrists, will provoke the patient into writing a letter which he would not dream of writing if there were complete freedom of delivery for all the letters he cared to write while in hospital.</p>
<p>I feel very strongly about this issue. I am in no way convinced by the Minister's reasons for going so far beyond the Royal Commission's recommendations. Something he said led me to suppose that he intends to go still further in accepting a later Amendment, which is perfectly logical once any kind of censorship is accepted. It is because I believe that censorship is inapplicable in these cases that I intend to press the Amendment to a Division.</p>
<p><i>Question put</i>, That the words proposed to be left out, to "would" in line 38, stand part of the Clause:—</p>

<p>ment appearing later on the Paper. I hope that he was looking at my Amendment.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of previous discussions, the Minister might think of this in terms of an addendum, since the words
<br><blockquote><p>"would be unreasonably offensive to the addressee, or the addressee has given notice in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0234">Image</span>

writing to the managers of the hospital or to the responsible medical officer"</p></blockquote>
and so on, should perhaps be included.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I intend to deploy an argument which has not yet been used. We are all anxious to give a patient maximum freedom while 'reducing to the minimum the amount of annoyance caused by his letter writing. An aspect which has been overlooked is the harm which a patient might do to himself. It has been suggested that the writing of these letters might act as a catharsis. We all know that these letters deal with sex and cause much un-happiness and unpleasantness and are due to the patient's own projection. That is a simple psychological analysis. I am not sure whether the psychiatrists say that to give the patient this form of projection necessarily improves his condition, but that is an argument among psychiatrists.<br><br>
The Minister has already described the kind of letters which are written. If the patient is given complete freedom to write such letters, he may refer to the rector and to the postmistress and allege that the postmistress is having an affair with the rector. He may send the letter not to the rector or the postmisress, but to the butcher or grocer in the village high street. It can be argued that, knowing the patient to be mentally disordered and in a certain home, the rector, postmistress, butcher and grocer could get together and say, "It is deplorable, but we all know the position".<br><br>
However, with our new approach to mental disorder, we hope that, as a result of new treatments and so on, patients will be discharged very soon after admission. If we allow the patient to inform the village high street of the alleged misdemeanours of the rector and the postmistress, there will have to come a time when the patient will return to the village as a normal man. He will be shown the appalling letters and asked whether he wrote them. Then, being a normal man in no sense mentally disordered, he will have to admit that he did write the letters.<br><br>
Here is a position calling for our sympathy. It is a case in which we should protect the patient against himself. It is not possible to do that under subsection (1), in which we are told that the respon-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
sible medical officer will be able to prevent the patient receiving packages if it is felt that their receipt causes him unnecessary distress. In subsection (2) we protect only the addressee. We must also protect the patient.<br><br>
We have mentioned libel in the Amendment. Not for a moment do I think that a charge of libel against a former mental patient could be sustained. However, we have inserted "libel" to emphasise the form of defamation which we have in mind. This would be a libellous attack on someone unable to defend himself. I am told that somebody who receives a letter of this kind will have the opportunity of writing, say, to the superintendent of the hospital, asking that no more letters of this kind are sent; but one letter to the butcher or the greengrocer about the rector or the postmistress is quite enough in the village. The harm has been done. We mention "libel" not because we think patients will have to be protected from actions for libel but to emphasise the serious nature of the information which the patient may convey in a letter.<br><br>
If the Minister thinks fit to have this Amendment incorporated later, I would ask him to consider enlarging the Clause in order to protect the patient in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, and so is the whole Committee, to the right hon. Lady the Member for Warrington (Dr. Summerskill) for putting this suggested improvement so clearly to us. She said that it should be regarded as an addendum rather than as a substitution, and I agree. Between us, we have just about got right the wording of the Clause and the wording of the Amendment.<br><br>
We have the position that the Amendment reads as a substitution. "Offensive to the addressee" would come within the subsection and not within the Amendment. "Contains libellous matter" would come within the Amendment and not within the subsection, and so would "detrimental to the patient."<br><br>
The first question which arises is should the addressee be allowed to give notice of discontinuance, as it were? Clearly, on any view, he should be allowed to do that.<br><br>
The second question, which is rather difficult, is whether the criterion is more properly "offensive" or "libellous". I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1958-1959V004P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 423</span>
think "offensive" is proper in regard to the addressee, while "libellous" may be the better word in regard to third parties. It certainly connotes the sort of intention we have. As was pointed out, this word is a term of art, a legal term. In the last analysis it is for the courts to say whether any particular words are libellous or not. It may be possible to use some such words as "appears to the responsible medical officer to be libellous." That might do.<br><br>
I certainly agree that protection should extend to save the patient from his own detriment, as is contained in the right hon. Lady's Amendment but not in the present subsection. The case is made out for the inclusion of libel on third parties, subject to drafting difficulties in regard to the word "libellous", which I would like more time to consider. The case is also made out for the inclusion of "detrimental to the patient" among the reasons for which correspondence can be withheld.<br><br>
I would like an opportunity to get the subsection in order by Report, and for it to take the form which I think the right hon. Lady, as well as we, would like it to have. It would be done to some extent by blending the subsection as it stands with her Amendment and would take into account the advice I get about the use of the word "libellous" in this context. If the right hon. Lady will withdraw the Amendment now, it will permit me to follow that course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for what he has said. In view of his assurance I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 22, line 45 to leave out from "to" to the end of line 47, and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"any Member of the Commons House of Parliament".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be convenient to take also the next Amendment, in page 22, line 47, at beginning insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or might reasonably be supposed to have been"</p></blockquote>
in the name of the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of the Amendment I am moving is simple.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 424</span>
There seems to us no particular reason why the pachydermatous Member of Parliament should not receive such correspondence as patients may wish to send, although they may not be constituents of the Member. Indeed, many patients do not know who is their Member of Parliament, and many hon. Members are not too sure who their constituents are. We should make this provision wide and so give added protection to the patients concerned. I hope that the Minister will find it possible to make this minor Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In formulating this provision we had regard to the accepted House of Commons practice that normally a Member deals with the affairs of his constituents and allows other hon. Members to do the same, but I quite appreciate that what is good House of Commons practice should not be enshrined formally in an Act of Parliament. Therefore I am glad to recommend the Committee to accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iremonger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. and learned Friend for accepting the Amendment, which achieves and more than achieves all I wanted to do by my Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>A mendment agreed to</i>.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 23, line 1, after "Master", to insert "or Deputy Master or any other officer".<br><br>
Subsection (2) enables the responsible medical officer to withhold from the post any outgoing postal packet from a patient detained in a hospital or mental nursing home if he considers that the contents would be unreasonably offensive or if he has received written notice. The subsection contains a list of people from whom postal packets may not be withheld and one of them is the Master of the Court of Protection. The purpose of the Amendment is to include also the Deputy-Master or any of his subordinate officers. Patients should be able to communicate confidentially with anyone in the Court of Protection about their private affairs.</span></p>
