	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before lunch, I referred to the constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) who had gone offshore to avoid the problems of capital gains tax; I emphasised that that was not the enterprising approach that we wanted in the economy. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) gave an excellent example from America that illustrated how we want United Kingdom entrepreneurs to start successful businesses, realise large capital gains and move on to start further successful businesses that generate prosperity and jobs. That is how our economy will grow and truly be the enterprise centre of Europe, which is what the Government's strategy is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said this morning that the Government's objective was to create distortion-free capital markets, and I am glad that he did so because that is fully in line with the new clause and the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Fulham (Mr. Carrington), for Dover and for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin). The problem with trying to achieve that goal is, however, that officials often advise Ministers to opt for ever more capital gains shelters, which do not promote distortion-free capital markets. The venture capital trust scheme has worthy objectives, but is regrettably extremely cumbersome, involves many intermediaries and has not achieved all the aims of those who designed it. So far, investments via venture capital trusts amount to only £40 million. We shall not promote distortion-free capital markets through venture capital trusts or enterprise investment schemes, but through a general reform of the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) made some interesting remarks earlier. He was close to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
adopting a socialist approach to capital gains tax when he talked about having focused exemptions, and we all know what that means. The man in Whitehall decides what investors should do and dreams up schemes for them to channel investments into areas in which he thinks they should invest. He then sets up a bureaucracy to achieve that and unfortunately further distorts the market. Conservative Members want to set people free to invest in the way that they want to within a general and fair capital gains tax scheme. A plethora of shelters is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly welcomed the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham. He mentioned the potential benefits for corporate governance of changes to a tapering system. Such changes would take us back to the origins of capitalism in this country, when people owned shares and were involved in companies and had an influence over their affairs. The new clause would help to achieve that, and I endorse my hon. Friend's suggestion that it would increase liquidity in the marketplace, which is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, North made some sound points about avoidance and stressed the amount of legislation that was already on the statute books to cover capital gains tax avoidance and so-called loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most interesting comments this morning came from the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), who wanted to keep his cards close to his chest. As I said when I intervened on him, Opposition Members have been clearer about their past strategies. In 1992, they were happy to table a new clause that would have introduced a taper system, but now they are being far more circumspect. I suspect that the reason for that is that they know that my new clause is a good idea—it would help the economy considerably, bring in more tax revenue and be good for taxpayers. Naturally, Opposition Members do not want the Government to introduce popular and successful measures which might result in a few extra votes when we arrive at a general election. They do not want that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to return to the Treasury and to press his officials again on the information that he has been given about costings. If he puts those costings under the microscope, he will realise that there are many flaws in them. I also urge him to take a wide international view of capital gains and to draw on some of the lessons from other countries in Europe, where capital gains tax systems operate much lower rates than ours. Some European countries have tapering systems. My hon. Friend should also consider the American experience where, once capital gains are cut, revenue increases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the position on indexation in the United States and the other countries that the hon. Gentleman mentioned? Is he really comparing like with like?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, some of those countries do not have indexation, but we now have a very low level of inflation in the United Kingdom, compared with what we experienced under
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
the Labour Government—inflation levels are now between about 2 and 2.5 per cent., so the benefits previously provided by indexation are much less in terms of value for relief. That must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A capital gains tax system which includes indexation encourages people to plump for safer, less risky investments because they know that they will receive an indexation allowance. In the United Kingdom, we need more entrepreneurs and more risk-takers. Indexation is also extremely complicated. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Oxford, East has any capital gains, but when he comes to complete his self-assessment form and endeavours to compute his indexation allowance on his potential capital gains, he will have quite a headache and will have to turn to an accountant or a lawyer for help. Perhaps another Opposition Member will be able to help, but he will have a pretty tough time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My message from the debate, in which many excellent points have been made, is that I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will return to the Treasury and endeavour to lift the scales from the eyes of many of his officials, look afresh at capital gains and realise that capital gains tax reform will raise more revenue, be good for the economy and for taxpayers and help us to be a true enterprise centre in Europe. However, given the lack of Opposition support, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 16</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SECTION 349 OF INCOME AND CORPORATION TAXES ACT 1988</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>".—In section 349(3) of the Taxes Act 1988, at the end of paragraph (h) there shall be inserted 'or' and after that paragraph there shall be inserted the following paragraph:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(i) to any amount which is deemed under section 730A to be a payment of interest, in the case where either the original owner or the interim holder is of any such description as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Treasury.'.".—[	<i>Mr. Carrington.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the excitements of new clause 15, I can reassure the Committee that new clause 16 is rather technical and somewhat boring. Consequently, I do not anticipate that it will take us most of the rest of the afternoon to debate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to address an anomaly in the gilts repro market. As matters stand at present, banks that enter into repos with a maturity in excess of one year do not have to withhold tax on the payment of the deemed interest on the repo. Securities houses entering into exactly the same transactions have to withhold tax when they make the final settlement under the repo. Tax paid will be recoverable but there is a delay in payment, which makes the securities houses uncompetitive in comparison with banks. That problem affects only repos in excess of one year. Below a year, securities houses and banks are treated in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The securities houses to which I refer are some of the large American institutions such as Salomon Brothers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0688">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
and Goldman Sachs and one or two Japanese houses such as Nomura Securities. All are caught under the present arrangements. The new clause tackles the problem by giving the Treasury the power, through regulation, to prescribe that certain institutions—the security houses—be treated in the same way as banks with respect to repo activities over one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is important. If the Treasury is not given this power, the security houses will be forced to carry out their activities offshore with consequences both to the competitiveness of the City of London and, more importantly, to employment prospects for people living in London since activities will be centred outside the UK. The main purpose, however, is to ensure that the gilt repo market is successful and contains the maximum amount of liquidity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seriousness of the problem has been debated. Gilt repos are a new market and it has been doubted whether repos with maturities of a year and above will constitute a significant portion of the market. Some indication of the likely development of these markets can be gleaned through consideration of equivalent markets in the United States. There, some 10 per cent. of repo books extend to a year or beyond. In the United Kingdom today, around 5 per cent. of the repo books are heading towards a year in maturity, but it is likely that the UK market will develop in the same way as the American market. A significant proportion of the market will probably be caught by the present failure to apply equitable treatment between securities houses and banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary may be reluctant to accept the new clause. It is a probing new clause, intended to find out the Treasury's intentions. The important fact is that the Treasury does not currently have the power by regulation to alter the treatment of securities houses in this market without primary legislation. Unless action is taken quickly to put the problem right, I urge my hon. Friend seriously to consider whether discussions could take place with the industry with a view to tabling an appropriate amendment on Report; otherwise, we shall have to wait until next year's Finance Bill, which could run into the problem of us having a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend feels that she can do something positive to overcome the problem. It is in everyone's interest—not just the interest of the Treasury—to ensure that the gilt repo market is as liquid as possible and has as many players as possible. It would be undesirable to exclude from the market the securities houses, which are major players in that financial activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the new clause. It is odd that the only exemption to section 349(2) is where payments of interest are made to and by a bank. Now that the market is not divided up quite so neatly, it seems nonsensical that a securities house should be discriminated against for doing exactly what a bank does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be historic reasons for the way in which the 1988 Act is phrased, or perhaps the Economic Secretary will tell us of some practical objection to
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
changing the law. It is possible that there may be objections on the ground of cost, as complications may arise from the fact that schedule D case 3 covers companies, local authorities and corporate partnerships as well as individuals. However, although there may be no imminent risk of securities houses going offshore, they should not suffer discrimination for no good reason. It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could say what the difficulty is. As the hon. Member for Fulham said, it might be better to tackle the problem in this Finance Bill, as I suspect that next year's Finance Bill will probably be rather short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham for tabling the new clause, which raises an important matter. There is anxiety that some of the business to which my hon. Friend refers may go offshore, so I shall spend a few moments explaining why the new clause may not meet his intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to say that, at present, it is not generally possible for companies other than banks to pay interest gross on secured loans that are capable of lasting for a year or more. Acceptance of the new clause would render that possible, but in that case we should expect to see a shift, especially by multinational groups, from the use of normal secured loans on which interest can only be paid net, to repos on which interest can be paid gross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is a problem with the wording of the new clause. I do not know whether my hon. Friend intended the meaning that it has, but the new clause provides for regulations to be made by the Treasury to specify those concerns that should benefit from the new clause. Although it is not clear which concerns should be covered by the clause, I suspect that, as it has been tabled with the support of the London Investment Banking Association, it covers many of that organisation's members. However, the terms of the clause are such that not only those concerns set out in Treasury regulations will be permitted to pay and receive repo interest gross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause covers both ends of the transaction: for example, when a company repays to a securities house which in turn repays to another company, all the parties in the chain would pay and receive repo interest gross. As a result a United Kingdom company that was part of an international group could use the procedure to get interest paid gross to an offshore tax haven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that my hon. Friend did not intend that, and that he was seeking a tighter definition. The cost has been estimated to be quite heavy, of the order of £50 million. For all those reasons, I am worried about the new clause as drafted. However, the real point is that we must ensure that securities houses do not feel disadvantaged and as a result take their business elsewhere. Despite that perceived disadvantage, the repo business prefers to go through securities houses rather than banks. From our discussions with LIBA, it is clear that there has been a difficulty about quantifying the proposed business for the long-term repo. I therefore feel that the best approach is to continue to ensure that our position is right for the securities market. The only way in which to do that is to obtain firm information from the companies and organisations that are involved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0689">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
to determine the extent of the requirement for a long-term repo market and how that market might develop in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here some of the correspondence that has been sent to us by the London Investment Banking Association and by other organisations. It is clear that, although LIBA has started to canvass its members to determine the future of the market, it has answers from only a small proportion of them. I suggest that the best way forward for my hon. Friend's proposal is for LIBA to finish its consultations and for us then to discuss in considerable detail precisely what it believes to be the future for the market, where it sees developments going, and how it thinks we can hold our tax position in this country. With that information before us, we can decide how best to maintain the supremacy of London as a financial centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I recognise that new clause 16 might be drafted more widely than I or the London Investment Banking Association intended. The intention behind it was to ensure that securities houses would be treated in the same way as the banks for payments under repos, so that there was no discrimination between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what my hon. Friend was saying, and am grateful for her offer to listen and react to evidence that the industry might produce for her. My only comment concerns time. Once a business has moved offshore, if the legislation lags seriously behind the market needs, it will be hard to get the industry back into London. There is, therefore, a degree of urgency in the matter. I hope that the discussions can be kept as brief as possible and, if the case for action is made sufficiently convincingly, I hope that it will be possible to find a way for securities houses to be treated on a level playing field with banks, without waiting for primary legislation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause concerns the shipping industry, in which I have a strong interest, for three reasons. First, I was brought up in a shipping family in Liverpool, which goes back many generations. Secondly, a number of people in my constituency are closely involved in the shipping industry. Thirdly, we are dealing with an industry that is vital for the future of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 16 years, I have done my best behind the veil of ministerial responsibility to persuade my ministerial colleagues to introduce measures that are more conducive to the growth of British shipping than hitherto been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a new experience for me to be able to do that from the freedom of the Back Benches. I do so for three important reasons. First, although the shipping industry's share of the world trade has declined under successive Governments, as a major earner of invisables it contributes £4,200 million gross to our balance of payments, a critical contribution to the country's future. Secondly, the shipping industry is the key to success for many other industries: not only the shipbuilding, maritime equipment and ports industries, but banking, insurance, broking and my own profession of the law. Thirdly, the worldwide shipping industry believes that there are great opportunities ahead. The current total world shipping market is around £100 billion and world seaborne trade is estimated to grow by around 70 per cent. in the next 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore have to do all we can to ensure that our industry is competitive and I have another three points in that regard. First, our fleet now has an average age of 16 years; the world average is 14 years and the European average is between eight and 12 years. That is a stark contrast to the former position, when we had a much younger fleet than most of our competitors. Secondly, despite the efforts of my ministerial
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
colleagues, other countries have not reined back their subsidies and have continued giving unfair advantages and support to their own industries. We have tried hard to get them to roll back their assistance, but without success; consequently, the British fiscal and subsidy support is now one of the lowest in Europe. Thirdly—I know that this does not fall directly within the purview of the new clauses—employers' national insurance contributions for seafarers are forcing too great a burden on our industry, which means that many of our long-standing companies are flagging out and engaging a work force from countries other than the United Kingdom. We need to review that burden and introduce more training assistance schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to new clause 19. Last year, the Government introduced special provisions for rollover relief on balancing charges for ships. The shipping industry warmly welcomed that measure which led to several reinvestment decisions by shipowners that would not otherwise have taken place or have been as well-timed. Sections 33(a) to (f) of the Capital Allowances Act 1990 has, I understand, at last been cleared by the European Commission and I welcome that. Several important improvements were made last year, not least extending the maximum rollover period of six years. However, we need to extend the new provision to groups of companies; the present provision is also causing several anomalies that need to be removed. The new clause contains all the elements necessary to meet the industry's objectives and the legitimate concerns of the Revenue and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many bona fide trading reasons why new investment may have to be placed in a different group company from that which has disposed of a particular vessel. For example, some companies allocate different types of ship to different group trading companies—sometimes as a condition of external commercial agreements or contracts. Many aspects of a shipping company's business, for example charter obligations, ship management arrangements, flag registration and manning and labour agreements influence the way in which a shipowner's business is structured and operated. Ship financing institutions often have a strict requirement for investment to be placed in a clean owning company established just for that purpose. The new clause would enable the necessary criteria to be observed. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 20 seeks to allow enterprise investment scheme companies to bare-boat charter and to own ships. The EIS replaced the business expansion scheme, which had been utilised by a number of shipping ventures and had brought about a modest level of investment in ships, all of which were registered and managed in the United Kingdom. As with the BES, under the EIS the company has to be the beneficial owner of all its ships. Unfortunately, the EIS is not attractive to shipping ventures, because the relatively high level of risk is disproportionate to the relief: 20 per cent. as opposed to 40 per cent. under the old BES.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shipowner risk usually falls into two categories: first, the trading risk, which is the ability to secure charters at a rate sufficient to generate a trading profit after taking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
account of operating and financing costs, and, secondly, the capital risk, which is the possibility that the capital value of a ship may fall faster that its depreciated book value—from my experience of volatile shipping markets, that is a common occurrence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the old BES scheme, 40 per cent. tax relief was sufficiently high for investors to be prepared to accept both those elements of risk. If my hon. Friend accepted the new clause to bare-boat chartered ships, that would remove the capital risk and increase the potential interest of investors, who would still be limited to a 20 per cent. relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new development is that since 1993 it has been possible to enter ships on the British register that are bare-boat chartered to British resident operators. The operator of those ships is not the beneficial owner, but he acts as if he were the owner while paying a fixed charter hire. Conditions would be attached to such ships in EIS companies. As with own ships, they should be registered in the United Kingdom and be subject to the rules on management. In addition, the bare-boat charter should be for a minimum period. The new clause provides a period of five years, which is the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable risk from such ventures would remain due to the existing one-year charter-out restriction and the chances of a mismatch. The shipping market is volatile, as I said. But the advantage would be to allow companies to establish shipping operations without the need to be highly geared with loan financing. That would stimulate United Kingdom economic activity and employment, which is the aim of the EIS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 21 would reintroduce 100 per cent. capital allowances for new investment in shipping. That would be an important corollary to rollover relief as it would help those sectors that do not benefit from such relief. I refer, of course, to those companies that operate scheduled services, such as containers, ferries and cruise ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 22 of the 1990 Act contains provisions for a first-year allowance for a person carrying on a trade who incurs qualifying capital expenditure on plant or machinery that belongs to him during the chargeable period. New clause 21 would add a new section 22A to the 1990 Act, which would apply the general provisions in section 22 to expenditure incurred by a person in relation to investment in ships. All the safeguards in the 1990 Act would apply directly to the new provision, including the preclusion of use of the allowance for ships leased to non-British interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, when a ship is bought, an allowance of 25 per cent. of the cost may be claimed against tax in the accounting period in which the ship is purchased. In subsequent accounting periods, allowances on a 25 per cent. reducing balance basis are given for tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause, the new clause proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover and other new clauses will give a considerable boost to the British shipping industry. I do not know what my hon. Friend will say. He can point to a number of measures that have been taken over the past few years to help the shipping industry. With the new opportunities that lie ahead, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
hope that he will give the green light to these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am primarily interested in new clause 44, the other new clauses are also interesting because they seek to help a hard-pressed industry. As the right hon. Gentleman said, it impacts on areas beyond those of seafarers and affects my landlocked area, which contains industries that supply marine equipment and parts for the shipping industry. That is why the new clauses are of interest to all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask a few questions about the new clauses—first, about new clause 21 on first year allowances for ships. Until the mid 1980s, the capital allowance regime was highly advantageous. Ship owners could obtain a 100 per cent. allowance in respect of the cost of the ship and could even apply that allowance to any accounting periods during which the ship was owned. That gave ship owners great flexibility in tax planning and the regime became known as free depreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital allowance regime for shipping companies is still reasonably advantageous. As the right hon. Gentleman said, there have been a number of changes in recent years. Owners can no longer obtain 100 per cent. capital allowances on their ships but they are able—under section 31 of the Capital Allowance Act 1990—to exercise greater flexibility than the normal trader in determining the accounting period in which they receive the 25 per cent. writing down allowance on the cost of their ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 21 will grant ship owners 100 per cent. first year allowances in respect of ships acquired in accounting periods ending after 6 April. Section 30 of the Capital Allowance Act 1990 will also allow a ship owner complete flexibility over the accounting period in which the 100 per cent. first year allowance can be claimed. Does the right hon. Gentleman want to restore the free depreciation of the mid 1980s, under which the ship owner had the ability to move the allowance around as he wished?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 20 deals with changes to bare-boat charters applying for five years. Ships often have lives of 20 or more years, so why was five years chosen? Would not a longer period be more appropriate? Will the right hon. Gentleman answer that question in his winding-up remarks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my childhood during the 1960s, I recall my Mum buying me an atlas. On its front page was a bar graph of the world's various merchant fleets. The longest, which went right across the first page of the atlas, represented the British merchant fleet, which was the biggest in the world. Since then, the bar graph has shrunk, and the number of registered British ships and of British seafarers in employment has declined. The United Kingdom shipping fleet today represents 1.9 per cent. of the world's fleet; when the Government came to power in 1979, it was 6 per cent. We are now 15th in the world in terms of the number of registered ships; in 1979, we were fourth. As the right hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt) said, our ships are 16 years old on average—twice as old as in 1979. More than 50,000 British seafarers were employed in 1979; today, the figure is 17,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
Some 75 per cent. of the British fleet is flagged out, and that process continues; indeed, P and 0 Containers Ltd. announced just before Christmas that it intended to flag out five ships—25 per cent. of its fleet—to the Bermuda register. If companies flag out, they tend to use foreign—eastern European or Asian—seafarers, which represents more lost jobs and more lost income for the Treasury through lost tax and national insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union organised a "Save our Ships" petition a few years ago, which 330,000 people signed. The number of people who are directly linked to the prosperity of our shipping industry is, however, far greater, because companies throughout the country contribute to it. Jimmy Knapp, the general secretary of the RMT, has warned all of us that, unless action is taken, we shall not have a British rating in 10 years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other European countries have already acted, and 10 of them have reduced their seafarers' non-wage costs through income tax and social security alleviations, which have reduced differentials with far eastern and eastern European crews. British crews do not receive such benefits and therefore tend to be 25 per cent. more expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation has been recognised by a broad range of organisations, including many in the House. The Select Committee on Employment said in a report in November 1993:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We emphasise that the remedial measures which we recommend are urgently needed. Without them we believe that by the end of the century there will be no significant UK merchant shipping industry."</p></blockquote>
In June 1995, the Select Committee on Defence said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is little hard evidence to suggest that sufficient ships would be available within the required time-scale for an operation of any significant size."</p></blockquote>
Even the Chancellor said in April 1994:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise that it is common for shipping companies overseas to benefit from special tax provisions … We also recognise that competitively, tax measures available overseas put our shipowners at a particular disadvantage."</p></blockquote>
Many other countries—including Denmark, France, Germany, Greece and the Netherlands—have more favourable fiscal subsidy packages than the United Kingdom. Packages in Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden are worth almost three times as much as United Kingdom provisions. I have been provided by the Chamber of Shipping with a list of various countries' tax subsidies, although I will not read out all of them. It is no wonder that the chamber is concerned that other countries have recognised the problems that face the shipping industry and have dealt with them as a matter of urgency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We must also increase industry earnings and Government revenues by expanding our shipping fleet. We need to strengthen the business and skills linkages with other maritime-related business.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to refer the Financial Secretary to what is in the new clause, which he clearly has not troubled to read. First of all, we need to assess the policy options and the tax systems that will ensure free competition in the European Union and with those other countries with shipbuilding industries. We must put in place the right tax and fiscal measures that will revive the shipbuilding industry. That is why a coordinated package is so important. The problem should not be approached in an ad hoc manner with the introduction here and there of new reliefs or capital allowances. We need to devise a co-ordinated plan after proper consultation with industry and an evaluation of the competition. The report that would come before Parliament would allow a proper evaluation of what needs to be done to revive our country's shipbuilding industry. It would deal with the flagging-out arrangements and create more jobs for our seafarers.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
That objective should be shares by all hon. Members. I hope that it will be the objective of the Financial Secretary. He may not be able to accept some of the proposals made by the right hon. Member for Wirral, West in their present form. However, our proposals in new clause 44 would not apreciably change the Government's current strategy but might enable everyone in the House of Commons fully to appreciate the problems and policy options open to us for the shipbuilding industry. The new clause would also set a clear strategy to deal with the decline that has afflicted the United Kingdom for several decades and would ensure that problems that have not been effectively tackled are tackled in future so that we start to reverse the decline. My children might not see such a long bar graph in their atlas, but I hope that it will be somewhat longer than it is at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief, Mr. Hogg, but as you appreciate, I have a strong constituency interest in the new clauses and have always taken an interest in the affairs of the shipping industry during consideration of financial legislation. For a brief time in the late 1970s, I was seconded to Overseas Containers Ltd.—it is now P and O Containers Ltd.—and I gained some experience of the shipping industry at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am please that in the past few years the shipping industry has managed to secure several amendments to financial legislation. That has happened because its case has been improved in terms of its professionalism and the arguments for some small changes to tax legislation have been well put. The Government have conceded their necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of rollover relief and group relief, the new clause represents a logical extension of last year's suggestions. They were greeted with some concern by the Inland Revenue to tax avoidance grounds, although it is not beyond the wit of man to word the proposal so that the tax avoidance issue could be dispensed with and we could ensure that the measure applied only to genuine investment in shipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if Ministers could seriously consider the new clause to amend the enterprise investment scheme because the business expansion scheme never went overboard in making tens of millions of pounds available to shipping, although it provided a few millions and was a modest success. I understand that investors took quite a risk and that not all investments under the business expansion scheme were successful. Investments fulfilled all the requirements of the business expansion scheme: they were genuine, entailed considerable risk for investors and benefited to a small extent a very important industry. I hope that we can make some progress on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Chamber of Shipping would like a 100 per cent. first-year allowance for ships, those days have probably gone. It is worth promoting the issue again given that it is always interesting to hear whether Ministers have any new stories about the matter. I subscribe to the argument that we must have a better allowance system. A 25 per cent. reducing balance is
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
not enough of a write-off in the early years when one is contemplating an investment of £50 million to £150 million, which is what a modern ship would need. That is more than the cost of most manufacturing plants. Many such plants built in the United Kingdom receive some form of Government assistance, especially if they are located in assisted areas. There is a strong argument for the shipping industry to be treated as an assisted area in its own right and for some form of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I condemn the current situation in the English Channel where there is a very odd market. The French are supporting and subsidising Brittany Ferries with inefficient French labour practices on board, old-fashioned trade unions and many French socialistic attitudes. All the ferries sailing out of Dover are fully competitive without receiving any Government subsidy or assistance—and one must remember that they are competing against a channel tunnel that has had £8 billion of finance written off, to all intents and purposes, by the banks—so although the channel tunnel is not subsided by the Government, its finances are enormously subsidised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January, a lorry on a Dover ferry went at £135 average revenue to the ferry company, whereas the previous January it went at £200 average revenue. It is not market-led competition that has produced that, but the fact that the channel tunnel is so desperate for business that it went to its bankers and said that it would not pay any return on its capital but would drastically cut prices, thereby damaging the market across the English channel. That is extremely unfair competition.

The Minister should not be taken in by Opposition arguments that seek to make the Conservatives responsible for what has happened to our shipping industry. I remember the UNCTAD code which was drawn up by the United Nations and which destroyed our ability to cross trade and carry cross-trading traffic. A Labour Government signed up to that and it is hardly coincidental that the atlas bar chart of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire changed direction considerably under Labour Governments. Our shipping industry declined from 1974, when the second of the recent Labour Governments were in power. I also remember a Labour Government that, amazingly, gave money to communist Poland to buy ships that would compete against our ships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point, and I hope that he will not take us on a voyage to Poland, eastern Europe and other unpleasant places.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made the point that Labour shares responsibility for the decline of the British fleet and I hope that I have also made the point to my hon. Friend the Minister that we do not have a level playing field. Of course, there are differences between business sectors and industries, but if we say that shipping is similar to manufacturing in that it requires a large capital commitment up front there is an argument for the shipping industry to have some favourable treatment because much manufacturing attracts additional support. I hope that the Minister will consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest and concern to the views of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee on the shipping industry. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West had strong family and business connections with the shipping industry, and he knows that for some years I earned my living in the shipping department of Procter and Gamble, where the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) also plied his trade before going off in a different direction. I appreciate and understand the nature of the international shipping industry. In considering the new clauses, it is important to reflect on the tremendous increase of competition in shipping and shipping services that has occurred throughout the world. One has only to look at Lloyd's List to understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with my right hon. Friend's proposals new clause by new clause, but first I shall dispose of the issues raised by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire in his advocacy of the British shipping industry. Like the hon. Gentleman with his ancient atlas, when I was Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food I discovered that anything to do with our people going down to the sea in ships touches a deep chord. Sometimes, any thought of rational argument goes out of the window when our maritime tradition comes up for discussion. One can understand why that is, but it can make it difficult in the harder arena of Government to hold the rational discussions that we must have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire accused me of not having read his new clause. I read it a number of times and felt that if he cared to ask me certain questions, I might be able to find some mechanism by which to deliver the information that we have on the subject, without having to go to all the trouble of making a report to Parliament. Suddenly, he said the magic words—that the Chamber of Shipping had provided him with all the information, but that he would not detain the Committee by reading it out. He let the cat out of the bag there: he already had the information, but his new clause requested that I should produce another version of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Gentleman and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West that if there is a common theme on both sides of the Committee with regard to the new clauses, it is the sensible need for the Government to maintain a proper dialogue with the shipping industry. I have already tried to do that. As we shall see, I might not be able to go as far as my right hon. Friend wants me to on certain matters, but it would be sensible to maintain a dialogue with the industry on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the themes that has emerged from our discussions, particularly from the remarks of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire and of my hon. Friend the Member for Dover, is fair competition in shipping. The Government recognise the risks to fair competition that can arise, certainly in the European context, if member states give over-generous incentives for shipping. However, the primary responsibility for tackling those issues lies with the European
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
Commission, which has been given powers under the treaty to enforce the rules on controlling state aid from member states. That goes to the heart of what my hon. Friend the Member for Dover said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Commission is already considering competition in the shipping industry is relevant to new clause 44. A questionnaire has been issued to member states with a view to establishing a register of state aids for maritime transport. The Commission is due to produce a document on maritime strategy in the spring. Under the circumstances, it is sensible for us to wait and see what information comes from the Commission, rather than acting in parallel and touching on the similar ground that is adduced in new clause 44. I am sure that in due course, there will be a debate on the findings of that report. For those reasons, I am not attracted to the proposal of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West put forward several proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I have before me is a sheet of paper with information on various tax clauses. The Government could do an awful lot better than providing one sheet of A4 on tax provisions. New clause 44 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other states as Her Majesty's Treasury think fit".</p></blockquote>
Many competitors in the shipbuilding industry are from non-EU countries. Is it not, therefore, important that we have a full assessment, not only of EU countries but of other countries that are engaged in the shipbuilding industry and in shipping generally? We could then form a co-ordinated strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not being rude to the hon. Gentleman but having been in the business, I can tell him that the economics of shipping are not wholly dependent on the tax regime. Yes, it is an important feature, but if one is to make the kind of analysis that the hon. Gentleman proposed, one must consider all the cost functions that affect the running of shipping, including its profitability. It is not a question of picking certain countries and making such a comparison. The danger of considering only the tax aspect is that one considers those matters in isolation and cannot then see the totality of the subject. That is why, when declining to support the hon. Gentleman's new clause, I prefaced my remarks by saying that I would be happy to have a continuing dialogue with representatives of the shipping industry. They have a close knowledge of operating costs and would be prepared to give a thorough briefing in support of their position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On new clause 19, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West asked us to consider extending the terms of the rollover relief that were granted the last time we considered this matter. I listened carefully to what he said: he argued persuasively for a tax remedy so that the shipping industry can derive the full benefit of the rollover relief. The industry claims that the relief would interfere with commercial decisions. I accept that we must look at this area again. The Government have never objected to the principle behind the proposal, although we questioned the means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell my right hon. Friend that the new clause is not the answer, as it could lead to abuse. For instance, it would allow the balancing charge to be deferred for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
ever by roll over into a non-resident company. It would also allow the benefit of the roll over to pass out of the group by roll over into a ship bought by a subsidiary on behalf of another group, with the subsidiary then sold to yet another group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are not minor difficulties, and much further work will need to be done to come up with a measure that will give the shipping industry what it wants and protect the Exchequer against abuse. If it is to the liking of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West, I propose to instruct my officials to work with the shipping industry to develop a workable proposal with a view to introducing the measure in the next Finance Bill. More work needs to be done, but I want to respond as positively as I can to new clause 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 20, my right hon. Friend deals with the subject of bare-boat chartering and invites us to consider whether the enterprise investment scheme could be operated in conjunction with that method of making shipping capacity available. The new clause deals only with the EIS: if we were to do a proper job on bare-boat chartering, we would need to amend the rules for venture capital trusts and reinvestment reliefs as well. Moreover, the EIS legislation makes special provision to allow not only the activity of chartering out ships to qualify under the scheme, but companies undertaking such activity to raise £5 million annually under the scheme, whereas all other companies are limited to £1 million. The scope of the new clause is limited to expanding the activity that shipping companies can undertake and it does not extend the special £5 million limit to that additional activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another problem. The general rules of the EIS exclude companies that receive predominantly lease income from using the scheme. Special rules exist to allow companies that charter out ships to use the EIS. In return for that exception, we require those companies to own the ships that they charter. The EIS already enables companies that want to charter out ships to use the scheme. There is no compelling need to provide a second route for companies wanting to undertake that activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to find out whether bare-boat chartering had been popular. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West said, it is a relatively new activity. Since bare-boat chartering was introduced into the United Kingdom, only six such charters have been registered, compared with 62 registrations of purchased ships. My mind is not entirely closed on this matter, but I remain to be convinced. As part of further discussions with the industry, I am more than willing to re-examine its case for this measure. I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that there are good reasons why I must resist his proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 44 invites us to restore 100 per cent. capital allowances to the shipping world. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire emphasised his party's concern to deal with the competitiveness of the British shipping industry. However, he did not raise the curtain enough to tell us what resources will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
Let me briefly refresh the Committee's mind—without going into too much detail—of the preferential treatment already meted out to the shipping industry. In fairness, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire adduced that when he spoke about the way in which allowances can be taken. He spoke of the greater flexibility of the allowances under present arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shipping companies in this country already benefit from a very competitive corporation tax regime, which is why I mentioned the wider issue of what makes for a good return for the shipping industry. There are tax exemptions for sea-farers and other non-tax measures such as grants towards the cost of merchant officer training, maintenance of the merchant navy reserve, financial help to transport British crews to and from distant waters and the rollover relief to which I have already referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have skirted over that ground to emphasise that the Government are sympathetic to the shipping industry and have put their money where their mouth is. The main reason why I am not attracted to extending the allowances in line with the new clause proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West relates to costs. The best advice that I have received is that it could cost up to £70 million in 1997–98. My right hon. Friend will understand that much of it would be a deadweight cost. In our discussions with the industry, we need to consider the problem in its wider context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the record, when we had 100 per cent. first year capital allowances—between 1970 and 1984—they did nothing to prevent a significant decline in the size of the UK merchant fleet from 32.2 million gross registered tonnes in 1975 to 13.3 million registered tonnes in 1985. Other factors therefore are at play and they need to he weighed against the arguments for specific help with allowances. I am, however, more than willing to discuss with the industry its continuing concerns. It has unparalleled new opportunities in the international context. I shall bear in mind the comments made on both sides of the Committee when I consider the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West will understand that I cannot help him in respect of two out of three new clauses, but I have given him an undertaking on new clause 19 that we shall work positively to solve the problems with rollover relief and assist the shipping industry as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, in answer to the hon. Member for North Warwickshire, the new clause is not an attempt to return to the old regime but to keep all the restrictions of the Capital Allowances Act 1990. I should have made that clear and I thank him for raising the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The five-year period is justified for two reasons. First, the period should not be longer than the period in which the EIS company is in existence. Secondly, the company should have the same freedom that it would have with an owned ship—to dispose of the ship at an appropriate time. For those two reasons, I believed that five years struck the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover, other hon. Friends and I are grateful to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for his expressed sympathy for the

shipping industry. I am also grateful for his open-minded approach to new clause 19. I accept his comments about the effect of the new clauses, but I had hoped that we might speed up the procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not even think about revealing what happened at meetings within government, but I recall a positive discussion about putting out parts of the Finance Bill to the private sector for drafting. Will my hon. Friend give me a few days to consult the Chamber of Shipping and its solicitor advisers to see whether we could devise a different draft that meets his points. I hope that he might find a moment in the meantime to discuss the matter so that we could solve straight away a problem that is holding up investment decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is designed to accelerate the depreciation deductible from tax on investments in new environmental technologies. The aim is to help both mainstream industry and service companies to adopt environmental technology. A secondary objective is to develop a classification scheme of innovative environmental technologies. That would benefit all industries, especially those which at present are increasing pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better to prevent pollution by whatever means are possible—and the Government have a part to play in that—than it is simply to punish the polluter after the damage has been done. The new clause is one small way in which that can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has been promoted by the Environmental Industries Commission, a new body that brings together about 100 companies involved in environmental technology. That body was started in April last year and was warmly welcomed by Ministers because of the benefits that those companies could bring to environmental development in this country. The body has argued powerfully in support of the new clause, whose provisions would not be considered unusual in Europe or several other countries. It would be helpful to examine a scheme from a country that has introduced a measure that accelerates the depreciation with which the new clause deals. The Netherlands introduced accelerated depreciation in 1991 and do not intend to halt it, because it operates successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Ministers and Opposition spokesmen will want to know the cost of new clause, and the Dutch Government estimated the cost of their own measure at 120 million guilder or about £48 million. We should recognise that the measure brings the depreciation costs into one year and to the front of the process—the money is, therefore, not lost. It is, therefore, not quite a one-off cost because there is an element of added cost. That should be set against the benefits that the measure will bring to an industry and market that can potentially expand. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I was assured this morning that the exchange rate was two and a half guilders to the pound, if that is what Conservative Members are trying to calculate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dutch scheme specifies the technologies that qualify and places them on a list, which is periodically
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
updated. Only best available technologies that have not yet reached major market penetration qualify for the list, and they are dropped once they have gained significant market share and can stand on their own two feet. In three years, 10,000 companies in the Netherlands have taken advantage of the scheme, which now applies to 450 different pieces of equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost that I mentioned was for 1994. We should recognise that such a scheme will not be huge at the outset and that the cost will be spread over several years. It will take some time for the scheme to produce the benefits for which we hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such schemes are not limited to the Netherlands. According to a 1993 OECD survey, accelerated depreciation schemes for environmental technologies operate in Canada, Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland and they may do so in more countries now. The new clause is in line with the recommendations in the OECD's 1994 report on environmental policy and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should recognise that, although we hear a plethora of green platitudes from the Secretary of State for the Environment, this country does not have a good record on developing environmental technology. Only this morning, I listened to more green platitudes about how good we were at monitoring. Unless we translate such platitudes and lip service into real promotion of the industry and real recognition of the benefits of pollution prevention, we shall not make a significant improvement in the United Kingdom. A recent survey showed that 89 per cent. of the companies involved in environmental technology felt that the Government's record was poor and could be significantly improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1995 Bill about the environment spent many weeks in Committee—even longer than we are spending on this Finance Bill—and we debated the argument surrounding this new clause on several occasions. We were all in favour of the environment agency, but one of the sharpest disagreements involved the emphasis given in the Bill to the costs and benefits of environmental controls and regulations. We were especially disappointed that so much emphasis was placed on the potential cost to and burden on industry because, by its very nature, such emphasis ignored the fact that new environmental regulations were a stimulus to the type of environmental technologies, industries, companies and firms that would be helped by the positive approach suggested by the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that there is no difference between the parties in recognising that there should be proper compliance cost assessments and that the BATNEEC principle—best available technology not entailing excessive cost—should apply. There is no disagreement that such issues must be costed and spelt out, but continuously to emphasise the costs to and burdens on industry of environmental technology instead of the benefits to all of us and to the industries is a great mistake. We should recognise that the Government's record of investment in pollution control policies is poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can run through some figures: the percentage of gross domestic product spent on pollution control in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
United Kingdom is 0.4 per cent.; in the United States, it is 0.6 per cent.; in Germany, it is 0.8 per cent.; and in the Netherlands, which I have already mentioned, it is 1.9 per cent. In comparison with those countries we are at the bottom of the league and I suspect that many hon. Members from both sides of the House were disappointed at the Government's delay in implementing the pollution controls on volatile organic compound—VOC—emissions, which we discussed in Committee the week before last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand from the Environmental Industries Commission that the delays on VOC controls which were intended to reduce emissions by 30 per cent. by 1992 were primarily at the instigation of the British coatings industry and the British printing industry which stressed the cost burden to them. Such delays have an immediate and significant effect on the environmental technology industry that would have benefited. It is interesting to note that the potential market in VOC equipment is estimated at $659 billion in the European market. By putting off by two years the targets for VOC emissions in the United Kingdom, the Government have not just damaged the potential to improve air quality standards by 1999, but have damaged the possibility of boosting those industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is a far more positive way of dealing with crucial pollution issues. On VOC emissions, it is interesting that the environmental protection agency in the USA came under the same pressure from the printing, paint and coating sectors but stood firm and that those technology companies are now making inroads into the British market. We should not underestimate the potential for expansion within the technology industries worldwide. The Environmental Industries Commission told us that the industry has potential to expand by £600 billion by 2000 and that the UK currently has only 6 per cent. of that worldwide market, whereas Germany has 29 per cent. I have just been passed a note asking me what a VOC is: it is a car emission that causes ozone in particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of the new clause is that unless holes in the ozone layer over this country are treated with the seriousness they deserve, we will not be able to develop and promote the technology industries and the companies that will make an important

	<span class='label label-info column'>853</span>
contribution to reducing that significant danger. The new clause may seem to be about a few environmentally friendly companies, but the issue of how we approach the environment is important not just for our and our children's health but for developing jobs and the economy. We are a member of the European Community, which is taking the lead on regulations and proposals that deal with pollution—particularly air and water pollution. The Commission recognises that the issue crosses boundaries and, as a group of countries working together, it can introduce measures that are of great benefit to all countries. Through such measures, particularly those taken up by member states such as the Netherlands and Germany, we can corner the market in environmental technology, which would have a significant impact on our economy and jobs in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The environmental industry has created 100,000 jobs this year alone, and there could be a further 3 million to 4 million jobs in Europe by 2000. I am aware that people are sceptical about how we conserve water and how we deal with air pollution—they wonder whether we should bother to deal with it and whether it matters that we drive a car to work rather than cycle or use public transport. The public and British industry will become more and more concerned about those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that most of the major companies in the water and waste industries would support such a proposal. It is a small thing to ask that we bring forward the capital depreciation on new technology to the first year to provide the stimulus that the public want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to support new clause 26 and endorse many of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson). I want to highlight four points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, when the Chancellor announced the Budget, claims were made that it was a green Budget. The new clause would widen and deepen its greenness. It is essential that every Finance Bill helps to enhance the environment and to reduce pollution. Elements of the Budget do that, but this is an important new clause, whose significance is heightened because today the Secretary of State for the Environment released statistics about environmental pollution which make sad reading. They suggest that since 1970, although the amount of travel has almost doubled, the amount of fuel use has more than doubled, and the amount of energy and electricity consumed in the home has not decreased, despite all the Government's efforts, but has increased. We should consider new mechanisms for tackling those problems. The new clause does that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, environmental industries are the industries of the future. I spend a lot of time talking to young people. One of their key concerns and one of their priorities is a greener environment—a better world, as they would put it. I believe that we will see progress towards more restraint on industry. That is happening all the time, and British industry must be able to respond to that. This is a growth industry and I want Britain to be an international leader in it. With help from the Government, we can follow that path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we must follow that path because it is part of an international initiative. My hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
for Hillsborough has already talked about the help—in terms of finance and taxation—that other Governments give to their industries. It is clear to me and to industry in our country that we lag behind the world leaders. The new clause gives us the opportunity to probe the issue and to encourage Ministers to pursue that course more vigorously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the new clause would not be expensive. We need first to quantify the cost. It has already been noted that the new clause would accelerate depreciation so that the total amount of money would be rephased. If I am right to say that the new clause would create new industries, new firms and new jobs, the Government would benefit by an increased tax take. We can be positive about those measures. I should be interested to learn from the Minister when he winds up whether any work has been done on the cost of the new clause to the Treasury. That cost would need to be set against benefit. The real benefit is the enhancement of the environment—a cleaner world with less pollution. Cost and benefits will add up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined the four areas that I wanted to stress—environmental enhancement, the creation of jobs, international competitiveness and cost and benefit. The new clause's time might not have come, but I am confident that such financial incentives will eventually see the light of day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief and will not repeat the arguments that have been made so eloquently by my hon. Friends the Members for Hillsborough and for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic goal that this country and western Europe as a whole should be striving for, which I am sure is shared by my hon. Friends and possibly by many Conservative Members, is the achievement of economic growth without growth in the consumption of nonrenewable, natural resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nestlé Rowntree, a company in my constituency, recently opened a combined heat and power plant which meets the needs of its factory and feeds electricity back into the national grid in lower consumption periods. The company made that investment because it concluded that in economic terms, it was cost effective and therefore benefited the company, which also consumes less energy than it did previously when it bought energy from the national grid. The lower consumption of fossil fuel that results benefits society—not only us but future generations. I am sure that all members of the Committee would support and encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the new clause is to encourage more firms to take similar initiatives where the economics are more marginal. A small fiscal incentive would mean the difference between their going ahead or not going ahead, and would therefore bring similar benefits to this generation and future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood pointed out, the Government have presented aspects of the Budget, most notably the landfill tax, as environmental measures. Cynics may say that that tax is just another Tory tax to raise hundreds of millions of pounds from industry to help them shore up the fragile position of the Treasury. I do not accept that for a minute. The tax is a

	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
sincere measure introduced to reduce the production and tipping of environmentally damaging materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need both a carrot and a stick. The landfill tax is a stick to punish polluters, but we also need fiscal incentives to encourage environmentally sound industry. The landfill tax will raise a substantial sum—about £110 million—in the coming fiscal year. According to the Red Book, it will raise some £450 million in a full fiscal year. The new clause asks what the Government will use the revenues for. Will some of the benefits of the environmental fiscal stick be recycled into benefits that will flow from an environmental fiscal carrot?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Environmentalists often say that they can see the future and that it stinks. I cannot see that far ahead, but I forecast that the Minister is unlikely to support the new clause. I hope that he will say whether the Treasury has considered the merits of recycling some of the revenue benefits of the landfill tax into other environmental incentives. If so, can we expect some measure incorporating environmental fiscal incentives in the next Budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Hillsborough who proposed the new clause. The hon. Member for Sherwood asked if we had carried out any costings. With respect, it is up to the proposers of a new clause to have some idea of the costs involved. However, I admit that in a crude way one might get a feel for the costs simply by grossing up on a pro rata basis according to population the difference between the cost of the Dutch scheme—about £50 million—and one in the United Kingdom. Replicating the Dutch scheme in this country would involve a minimum of about £150 million. That is a large sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) asked whether the Government would recycle in a beneficial way revenues from the landfill tax. As my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General said in his remarks on that tax, there would be a reduction of 0.5 per cent. in the national insurance charge. Clearly, it is up to any enterprise that receives the money freed up as a result to decide what to do with it. One of the options will be to invest such money in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister claimed that the cost could be calculated roughly by grossing up the cost of the Dutch experiment on a pro rata basis. He will be aware that the cost after the scheme had been in operation for three years, was 120 million guilders. A list was provided of the items that would qualify under the proposals, so the initial cost would not be so high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Government made a proper assessment of a similar scheme, or have they considered looking at the growth potential of the environmental industries, given the clear development of the global market in the next few years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost in 1994 was 120 million guilders, or about £48 million. That is the cost in the Dutch case and the basis on which I made my crude estimate. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
ventured into territory that perhaps I should have left alone when I tried to assist hon. Members by indicating what the costs could be. It is certain that there would be some cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make some more progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the industry's response, one of the most successful enterprises in my constituency is a company called Inenco. It would know about how to make environmental improvements because it is one of the leading companies in contact energy management. A company can adopt a scheme without needing a tax break and can share benefits. It has made an extremely successful business out of developing that line of advice. Businesses are often happy to pursue that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
B and Q is another example, as anyone who saw a recent edition of "The Money Programme" will know. Using nothing more than good business sense, B and Q motivated many of its suppliers to go down a powerful and sustainable development route. It is clear that British industry and commerce is responding well to the environmental challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the basis on which the Minister made his calculations. He says that if it costs £50 million a year in the Netherlands, a similar measure might cost £150 million a year in Britain because our population is three times the size. However, the Minister should consider the fact that the UK spent 0.4 per cent. of GDP on environmental improvement measures in 1990 compared with 2.7 per cent. of the Dutch GDP. In other words, the Netherlands spends about seven times larger a proportion of its GDP than does the UK. If that ratio were applied, the cost to the UK economy in a full year would be about half the cost to the Dutch—£25 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to draw our attention to costs and to stress that provisions must be fully costed before they pass into legislation. However, he should not dismiss the idea out of hand because he plucked figures from the air—perhaps that is not the right phrase—suggesting higher estimates than may be justified. I suspect that the cost to the Exchequer would be much lower than he suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I am being done down here. I simply provided a pro rata estimate to give a feel for the costs. I did not suggest that the figures were the maximum or the minimum. I am grateful to the hon. Member for York for saying that any scheme would have to be carefully costed. To that extent, I regard the new clause as probing this area. The hon. Member for Hillsborough will understand why I cannot accept the new clause on cost grounds. However, the fact that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor, supported by my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General, argued for landfill tax shows that the Government are prepared to consider taxes that have environmental dimensions. The door is not closed on that matter, but we have sometimes been chastised by Opposition Front-Bench Members about the importance of dealing carefully with taxpayers' money, which is why I have dwelt on the question of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0700">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>857</span>
The new clause would not replicate the Dutch system. It recognises neither the need for cost containment nor the careful monitoring of products and technologies that are included in the scheme. The framing is open-ended and I am sure that the hon. Lady will agree that more work needs to be done before the new clause could be accepted as providing a valid basis for a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept that if the principle of the proposal about environmental technology were accepted, there would need to be considerable further work and costing. I hope that the Minister agrees that identifying what is meant by new environmental technologies for the purposes of the incentive's operation would benefit the industries concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should highlight a few issues. Under the present arrangements, expenditure by the environmental technology industry on innovative research generally qualifies for scientific research allowance, which already gives 100 per cent. relief. Expenditure by an industry's customers on innovative environmental technology and products will qualify for a plant allowance of 25 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several other problems with the new clause. There is no definition of "innovative" or of how long something remains innovative. Under the proposal, one might discriminate against a long-standing technology that might be environmentally benign, but not come under the definition of "innovative". The scheme would be immensely regulatory, and the new clause does not define how someone would deal with not being designated on the list by the Minister. There are many unanswered questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should not and cannot accept the new clause as it stands, and I offer two observations. First, the hon. Lady and her colleagues referred to a report, but the United Kingdom industry comes out of it rather well and was praised for reducing its energy costs. Secondly, the Government take environmental technology best practice seriously, and the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment run a programme on it, which is now in its second year. It will cost £16 million over five years and aims to encourage industry to adopt better environmental technology and techniques, which focus in particular on waste minimisation and cost-effective cleaner technology. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates that the projects that were approved by the end of October 1995 could potentially produce net cost savings to industry of £72 million a year by 2010. The larger package of projects of which they are a part could stimulate total savings of £160 million a year by 2010. Work on additional packages this year will increase the potential savings further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That thumbnail sketch of an interesting issue illustrates how the potential of British industry and expertise is exploited to the benefit of industry. I hope that the hon. Lady will understand, therefore, why I am not attracted to the new clause and would ask my hon. Friends to reject it if she pressed it to a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond to the Minister's questions about definitions and the creation
	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>
of a list of new environmental technologies. The importance of the scheme is that it is useful to attempt it, just as we agreed it was useful to attempt a waste classification scheme, even though we knew that it would raise my questions. That does not mean, however, that it would not be useful to attempt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touched on the issue of the length of time that a product remains on the list. In the Dutch scheme, a product drops off the list when it reaches 30 per cent. of market share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has perhaps argued the case in his comments about the Department of Trade and Industry and Department of the Environment programme. If a combination of companies in the industry and Ministers from those Departments prefer that as a way forward, it might be the best way to stimulate this area of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is important because it involves the argument that was used in response to an earlier amendment about the film industry tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. It is a great mistake to argue that no further incentives are necessary because one firm in his area is doing well, as B and Q was reported to be doing in "The Money Programme". We are talking about a sector of the economy that has massive potential for growth. At present, we do not command as big a share of the global market as our skills, enterprise and industry deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that tax is a useful tool in that respect, but there are other incentives that can be used to promote environmental industries. My hon. Friend the Member for York said that the carrot is needed as much as the stick, and I am sure that, in time, such measures will have their place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall preface my brief remarks with a declaration of my interest in the matter, as I have done in previous years. I seem to remember the hon. Member for Oxford, East declaring similar interests in the past. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
do not know whether his interests have changed, but I have long been an admirer of the Friendly Societies movement. I have the benefit of two small Friendly Society policies, which I had long before I became a Member of Parliament. They are under the auspices of the Family Assurance Society, but they are not the main reason why I have advocated this cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that Friendly Societies are mutual self-help institutions owned and governed by their members. They have a long history of providing a range of social benefits and assistance to their members, as well as promoting self reliance and financial responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are more than 400 Friendly Societies in the United Kingdom. They provide sickness and accident benefits, benefits on death, savings schemes and other social benefits to around 8 million members. The movement's collective assets amount to more than £10 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The activities of Friendly Societies extend beyond offering policies and cover for specific contingencies, such as death or unemployment, to running convalescent homes and providing other social activities and services for groups of people such as widows, juveniles, police officers and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The insurance and savings schemes of Friendly Societies are designed to be affordable to ordinary working people. That is one of their great historic merits. The levels of contributions are generally much lower than those needed by equity and managed fund investment schemes. They serve a sector of the market that is not readily catered for by most institutional savings vehicles. Indeed, they are a unique and distinctive feature among the whole spectrum of financial institutions. They have often helped to provide members in need with benefits that exceed the requirements of insurance policies or saving scheme contracts. They do fulfil a purpose. If they did not exist, they would have to be invented. I hope that there is agreement across the political spectrum and in Committee this evening that the societies and the values that they promote should be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 29 would make a modest but worthwhile adjustment to the Bill. It would assist societies created after 1 June 1973—the so-called new societies—to carry out non-life and non-endowment business such as critical illness benefit. To provide a general explanation, the new clause seeks to remedy the effects of a technical feature of Friendly Societies taxation which renders inexpedient the development of products with modern features such as provision for the payment of benefit upon the occurrence of a serious illness. It was hoped that the problem would be addressed as part of a wider ranging reform of taxation of life assurance policyholders. The Committee will have noticed, however, that that reform has been shelved or deferred to this year's Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that Friendly Societies are exempt from tax on life or endowment business in respect of premiums up to £270 per annum. Older societies that existed before 1 June 1973 are completely exempt in respect of business other than life or endowment. The business of new societies is subject to a punitive tax regime, as they view it, under section 461
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
of the Taxes Act 1988. That explains the natural inequity in the tax arrangements which the new clause would address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of a historical quirk, life or endowment business includes a policy that covers both life and sickness risks only if, among other conditions, the sickness cost is at least 60 per cent. of the whole cost under section 466 of the Taxes Act 1988. Thus, a life policy that provides a more modest amount of sickness cover falls outside life or endowment business as defined in existing legislation. The £270 exempt limit does not apply. The tax regime makes it impractical for a new society to write such business. The main purpose of the new clause is to remove that impracticality which acts as a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, an old society will be wholly exempt in respect of such business without limit of size. Should a new society commence to write such business, the Friendly Society Commission—the regulatory body—can direct that an old society be treated as if it were a new one. The possibility of such a direction again renders the issue of such business impractical for an old society. The Committee will understand, I hope, that despite the technicalities, the main thrust of my remarks is to put so-called old societies on a level playing field with new societies—with 1 June 1973 as the dividing line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now wish to explain the practical meaning of the new clause. Subsection (1) would make the main change that I want to promote by inserting a new definition of life or endowment business. Apart from reordering existing rules, it would provide that when a contract is made on or after 1 September 1996, it is included in life or endowment business if it constitutes in part the carrying out of life assurance business of the types within class I, II or III of Head A of schedule 2 of the Friendly Societies Act 1992, or sickness business under class IV.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substituted subsection (1A) of section 466 reproduces the existing rule in section 466(1)(a) which describes the current anomaly whereby a policy is only treated as a life or endowment policy if it provides sickness business where not less than 60 per cent. of the premium is attributable to sickness business. That provision has prevented Friendly Societies writing life assurance business with a critical illness rider and the new clause intends to permit that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection 466(1B) simply reproduces the existing section 466(1)(b) in an unchanged form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of the new clause inserts two new definitions. Rather strangely, there has never been a definition of "insurance company" in the chapter of the Taxes Act 1988 dealing with Friendly Societies. Paragraph (a) corrects that omission, while the definition of "long-term business" is needed following its mention later on in the new clause in subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (3) and (4) of the new clause amend section 266 of the Taxes Act 1988 which deals with life assurance premium relief. The solution adopted here is to preserve the existing vestigial relief while ensuring that the widening of life or endowment business made by clause 1(1) does not open up the opportunity for more extensive relief.

Clause 1(5) amends section 463(1) of the Taxes Act 1988, which provides that the taxable business of a Friendly Society is charged to tax in the same way as the mutual life assurance business of an insurance company. Because the result of the clause is to include within the scope of taxable business some sickness business which is not life assurance business, it is necessary to extend the description of business in section 463 to provide a proper framework for such taxation. Clause 1(6) provides for the change to have effect for accounting periods ending on or after 1 September 1996. As a practical matter, Friendly Societies have accounting periods as the Committee may know which coincide with the calendar year so that it will effectively apply from 1997 onwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, new clause 29 simply repeals the provision that amended the existing section 466(1). My new clause substitutes a new section 466(1) so the legislation that introduced amendments to the old section is now effectively spent and standard practice nowadays is to repeal such introductory legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have given enough explanation of the background and purposes of my new clause to persuade my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and other members of the Committee to support it. I believe it to be a good clause and a small but worthy improvement in the tax regime affecting the Friendly Society movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have to declare an interest, although I have done so for several years. As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East made clear, the annual exchange has been between the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) and me in that my children are the beneficiaries of a policy with a Tunbridge Wells building society. Although that does not fall to be formally declared, even post-Nolan, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has been good enough to tell us about his good fortune so I am happy to share with the Committee what I hope will be my children's good fortune in the future. My. hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East tells me that he has no such interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the general thrust of what the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said about the desirability of putting Friendly Societies on an equal footing with other financial institutions. I have no difficulty with that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that the Financial Secretary will repeat the speech given by his predecessors and point out the difficulties presented by the new clauses and amendments. My hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
and new clauses is to ease the restrictions on Friendly Societies, and I wholeheartedly agree with that. The Financial Secretary may be able to agree to some of the amendments this year. I would have thought that we would have had no difficulty with new clause 29, which would allow Friendly Societies to write critical illness business, but perhaps I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want more choice and more competition within the industry, we should not hold back Friendly Societies needlessly. They should be allowed to compete on a level playing field. If the new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and amendments add to that process, we will happily support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main point that I would like the hon. Gentleman to lodge in his mind is that societies founded before 1 June 1973 would be put on exactly the same basis under tax law as new societies. My new clause deals with that point rather than Friendly Societies as a whole in relation to other savings vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no problem with what the hon. Gentleman says. If there are any difficulties, I would be interested to know what they are. The argument is the same: we should encourage Friendly Societies, because they have been around for a long time and are in a difficult position. They tend to be small and are up against large bank assurers. We want them to be able to compete on a level playing field. The time is long overdue when we should examine the rules and regulations across the industry and see what can be done to ensure that there is no disadvantage to the public in using one type of provider rather than another. I agree with the general thrust of what the hon. Gentleman said, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will agree this year to more than his predecessors have been able to agree to in past years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington described with meticulous accuracy the effect of new clause 29. He argued with eloquence and conviction the need to remove the anomaly with regard to life assurance policies issued by Friendly Societies. I have no difficulty recommending to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mutual insurers comprise five out of the top 10 most valuabe life assurance companies in the United Kingdom, as measured by the value of their assets. They count among their number some of the oldest and best known companies in Britain: Standard Life, Norwich Union, Scottish Widow, Scottish Provident, Equitable Life and Friends Provident. Their legal structure vanes, but all are ultimately owned by some or all of their policyholders, who participate directly in the profits of the organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years, there has been much talk of demutualisation—the transfer of ownership away from policyholders to third party shareholders. That is partly the product of similar moves in the building society sector, but other pressures have also come to bear. Industry analysts are now forecasting a new wave of demutualisations involving strong companies seeking capital to finance expansion, acquisition or the development of new distribution networks. Such forecasts have been fuelled by Norwich Union's hints at a stock market listing in 1997 but there has been speculation about many of the others too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are at present several tax difficulties with regard to demutualisation. Where payments are made to members in the form of cash or the allocation of shares it may give rise to an income tax liability. Special provisions prevent that for payments made on demutualisation to members of mutual building societies. In my view there is no reason in principle why mutual building societies should be better placed than mutual life companies in that respect. I believe that members of both organisations should be placed on an equal footing. The object of my new clause is to achieve that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield raised a number of important issues in relation to mutual life assurance companies. He is right to say that many of them are large, old and of some renown. Perhaps I can give him some assurances on some of his points. First, he talked about the tax position and shares, particularly where the interests in the company are membership rights, like those in mutual life companies which are exchanged for shares in a new company. His concerns are unwarranted because section 136 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 has applied in all the proposals that have been seen in the past by the Inland Revenue. There are some very tentative proposals which are just under
	<span class='label label-info column'>866</span>
consideration and there is no reason to believe that the section does not cover the proposals that we are looking at at the moment. My hon. Friend's concerns are therefore not justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's second point related to the position of payments to members of mutual life assurance companies and his concern that they might be treated as distributions. A rule already on the statute book—in section 490(2) of the Taxes Act 1988—covers that situation. Again his concern is not warranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's third point concerned demutualisation in general and the taxation position in respect of stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that there is an analogy between the demutualisation of insurance companies and the conversion of building societies. This is clearly a complicated area and it is one in which so far no real firm proposals have been seen. The best that I can offer my hon. Friend is a statement of the current situation as we see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are clearly a number of ways in which a mutual insurance company could demutualise: takeover is one and conversion to a plc is another. Beneficial ownership may or may not be changed by these processes. It is not our intention to charge stamp duty, or stamp duty reserve tax as appropriate, if the result of the demutualisation is no change in beneficial ownership. We are not currently in receipt of anything other than tentative proposals so we cannot make a judgment about whether the existing law on stamp duty will result in a change. Prospective demutualisation target dates appear some considerable way off. We propose to have a close dialogue with all those involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can put some questions to the Economic Secretary as I detect that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield may want to come back in the light of her comments. It puzzles me that her whole stance appears to be predicted on the fact that there have not been many approaches from the industry yet because the demutualisation targets are at some point in the future. I should like to think that the Treasury would do some thinking of its own before someone approached it to ask for specific changes in the law to aid demutualisation. As I understand it, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is suggesting removing some tax considerations from other considerations surrounding a decision by those concerned when considering demutualisation. He wants to remove tax considerations so, presumably, the argument about its merits can be addressed. I have no difficulty with that general proposition. I accept that further difficulties might arise, but I am puzzled about the Government's position. The Economic Secretary's position seems to be that, as no one has asked, the Treasury has not thought about the matter. That seems a strange position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also strange that the hon. Lady said that the target dates are at some time in the future. By definition, so they are, but they are not that far away. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said, it is well known that a number of mutual societies are thinking of demutualising and there is an argument for looking at that sooner rather than later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0705">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>867</span>
As I said this morning, I suspect that next year's Finance Bill will be rather short. I do not know how short, but it will probably be substantially shorter than this year's, so the scope for such changes will be reduced. If there is merit in the arguments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, it might be better to try to tackle them now than to wait for a Finance Bill introduced in the autumn of 1997 or at the beginning of 1998, which would not become law until summer 1998. I suspect that some of the demutualisations referred to will have been and gone by then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fortified in that view by what has happened to the building societies, to which the Economic Secretary referred. It is abundantly obvious that a shoal of anomalies has arisen as a result of several building societies announcing that they will be mutualised and changed to plc status. A number of people who thought that they would benefit from payments that have been made to encourage them to vote in favour of that will not qualify. Indeed, last year my parliamentary pair, the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. French) introduced a worthwhile Bill to reduce some of the anomalies thrown up by the Cheltenham and Gloucester takeover in which second signatories had been denied benefits when the first signatory had died.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. Norman Hogg 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>It is obvious that the industry's current restructuring has raised a number of problems that were not anticipated. Rather than waiting until the industry comes cap in hand to ask for changes, might it not be an idea for the Treasury to reflect on whether there is any merit in keeping the restrictions on the statute book? Or should the Treasury, out of the public interest—which the Treasury is meant to represent, as it is not a shopping centre for organisations that wish to demutualise—instigate ideas rather than the trade doing so? The Economic Secretary could be more helpful than simply saying that no one had been to see the Treasury but that, when someone did, it would think about it.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Beaconsfield has a point when he says that issues need to be addressed now. I have an open mind; no one has approached me, any more than they have approached the Treasury, with specific points, so I am not saying that I necessarily agree with the points made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. If he is saying that the tax under consideration is a complication, I see some force in that argument. The question whether a society ought to demutualise should be decided on wider merits than whether it is tax-advantageous or not. If all arguments are in favour of demutualisation and the only thing that could stop it is some restriction that cannot be justified for other reasons, we should consider it.</p>
	<p>The Economic Secretary should do more than simply tell us that the Treasury will wait and see. Time is not on our side. It might be two years before we are able to return to the subject in the sort of detail that is required. It would be a tragedy if we were to face the situation that currently exists with the building societies, because many of the problems would have been and gone by the time that Parliament got round to addressing them. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
not saying that there will be widespread hardship—that is patently not the case—but there will be inconvenience and the Committee should consider that. If there is time to do so now or on Report, the Economic Secretary should think again.</p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I was encouraged by what my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said, but want to put a point to her. It is similar to the point that has just been made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. Can he confirm that the proposal is not a special scheme that will fit Norwich Union, which, I understand, is talking to the Revenue at the moment, but will meet the requirements of all the others, including Friends Provident, which might want to be involved? That would be a better, more general solution rather than a particular solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edingurgh, Central perhaps did not listen to my reply, because two of the financial taxation points which were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield are covered by existing legislation. Therefore, the concern that there might be taxation impediments does not need to be held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point relates to a conversion of a mutual insurance company in the way that building societies have converted. We have been studying the point carefully and taking what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central refers to as a proactive stance. As far as we are aware, there is no tax obstacle. If someone identifies one we shall study it, but there appears to be no obstacle as long as the beneficial ownership remains the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation would be different if the beneficial ownership did not remain the same, which is one of the difficulties with the new clause of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield: it is drawn so widely that there would be no stamp duty liable for many of the normal commercial business structural changes that might take place in an insurance company. Clearly, that is not correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue relates to demutualisation and to consistencies in the beneficial ownership. As far as we are aware, there is no difficulty with that, but to ensure that the position is clearly understood, I read out the short statement, for want of a better way of describing it, during my closing remarks. We are not looking for what my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield described as a Norwich Union fix; we are looking for a situation with which mutual life assurance companies that want to take such a route can be comfortable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly encouraged by that. It is the answer that I was looking for.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finance Act 1995 made two major changes to the tax treatment of the trading losses incurred by life
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>
insurance companies. Although they were presented as necessary to prevent double claims to relief or artificial creation of tax losses, between them the changes have served to prevent loss relief claims by life companies in nearly all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result is that all life companies have been placed at a structural disadvantage compared with the generality of companies. Newly started life companies have been particularly badly hit because the nature of the business makes it likely that losses will be incurred in the early years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause deals with the problems which were created by the changes made by the 1995 Act. I shall not explain the detail, which is rather tiresome and technical, but adopting the measure would mean that life companies, like other trading companies, would be able to get relief once and once only for genuine trading losses. The Exchequer would continue to be protected against the possibility of double claims to relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield for tabling the new clause. The taxation rules for insurance companies are complex, as my hon. Friend explained. The law that governs that subject is amended almost continually, as new business activities develop, and, regrettably, new ways in which to circumvent the complex rules are devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause deals with utilising trading losses. Afficionados of the subject will be familiar with the I minus E taxation basis. But I am happy to report that the Bill is not about that. Last year, we introduced measures that prevented double relief for the same loss and ensured that artificial losses were not created in specific circumstances. There was no disagreement about whether action was necessary last year, but anxiety exists about the unduly harsh operation of the provisions in several genuine circumstances. We have discussed that with the Association of British Insurers. We hope to be able to introduce a provision to tackle the problem shortly. The new clause tries to deal with it, but it has some unintended consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision that we introduced last year restricted the use of losses that were offset by the introduction of capital from other parts of a company into its long-term business fund, which is the pool of assets that is allocated to meet the liabilities of life assurance and other long-term business. The existing rules had been abused and claims had been made for losses that were not genuine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision also restricted the use of losses that were funded by the injection of capital into the long-term business fund from another member of a group of companies. As I said earlier, we hope to introduce measures to tackle that soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause also tries to deal with the problem, but it goes further. By restricting the new rules for circumstances when a special bonus is paid to policyholders, it prevents them from applying to circumstances in which artificial losses were created in the past. We agree with the principle that new clause 38(2) sets out but it does not deal fully with all double allowance matters, especially as one of them is currently before the courts. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend to stay his hand.

The new clause is promoted by the Football Trust, which was established in 1985 to provide grant aid to football clubs. The dreadful tragedy at Hillsborough in 1989 changed everything. It claimed the lives of 96 football supporters. The Government tried to realise the recommendations of the Taylor report, which was published in 1990. There was a 10-year implementation period to get football grounds up to scratch by providing, for example, all-seater stadiums, where people could take their families, and where their safety was not imperilled. We are four years away fom the millennium, but 45 out of 132 league clubs in England, Wales and Scotland have not yet started work on the Taylor recommendations.

the Taylor recommendations. We might ask ourselves why that is the case. In some cases it is because clubs have only recently been promoted into the Premier League. In other cases, clubs are seeking to relocate to green-field sites away from the particular problems of inner-city locations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Football Trust is hamstrung because of the decline in its income. It is the only organisation that grants aid to football clubs to carry out the Taylor recommendations. The cataclysmic decline in the income of the Football Trust can be laid at the door of the national lottery. The Football Trust has submitted a separate memorandum to the Select Committee on National heritage spelling out the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain to this Committee the position of the Football Trust. It gets its income from three main sources including that from the reduction in pools betting duty. It tells me that there will be a shortfall of £13 million from that source. It also receives income from the spot-the-ball competition. In the year before the national lottery was introduced, the trust got £14.4 million from Littlewoods generated by the competition, but in 1996–97, the most that the trust can expect to receive from spot-the-ball is £4.5 million. Taken together, those factors make a big dent of about £36 million in the annual income of the Football Trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third leg of the income stool is the donations that the trust receives from the three countries' Football Associations. I am told that that amounts to about 14 per cent. of the trust's income. The Inland Revenue has smiled sweetly on the FA and its donations to the trust are treated as a trading expense and are tax-deductible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Football Trust wants to encourage donations from other bodies to help carry out the phenomenally expensive cost of transforming our football grounds into ones that are fit for the 21st century. We have, in the Premier League, a body that is awash with cash. The trust hopes that the new clause will provide a tax incentive to encourage the Premier League and other organisations that are interested in association football to make donations to the trust and help bridge the gap that has opened up between income and expenditure. Unless that gap is closed, by the end of decade there will still be football grounds across the country that have not delivered on the Taylor recommendations. The Government backed the Taylor recommendations and made the reduction in the pools betting duty to encourage that transformation. I urge the Minister to support the new clause, which is not being moved in a partisan way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the spirit in which the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) moved the new clause. I read the letter from the Football Trust before composing my response to his proposition. As he said, the purpose of the new clause is to encourage the Premier League to continue to make donations to the trust, which not only benefits their clubs, but clubs outside the league. Indeed, it does that by extending tax relief for any donation made for the purpose of improving the safety or comfort of spectators at a ground to be used for association football.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether such donations qualify for tax relief depends at present on whether the contributions were incurred
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0708">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>873</span>
wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the donor's trade. That is a general principle that applies to all trading entities, and it works well. Each case is decided on the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the Premier League's donations to the Football Trust, I understand that current rules are being discussed with the Inland Revenue and I should not want to anticipate the outcome of those discussions. Even if the Government were minded to consider a further special relief for donations to the trust, the hon. Gentleman's new clause goes too wide and is not confined to donations from league clubs to the Football Trust but applies to any person who in the course of his trade promotes association football.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to hold out the hope that the Inland Revenue may agree in its discussions with the Premier League to agree the purpose of donations from the league to provide the tax benefits that the new clause seeks. How long will those discussions take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman that the discussions are current, but he should read carefully what I have just said about long-standing tax treatment of this type of payment in the context of the discussions. Obviously, the Inland Revenue is wholly independent of what I do, but the discussions are taking place against the background of knowledge of the letter from the Football Trust and the general problem that led to the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause could include anyone from major Premier League clubs to shopkeepers who display a poster advertising a local club match. The trader is given tax relief for both minor improvements and, at the extreme end, for the costs of building an entirely new stadium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has no commencement date, and that is another drawback which could lead to unforeseen questions of retrospection. The measure on which the new clause was modelled had no need of a starting date as it was linked to a reduction in pool betting duty, but the new clause could cause retrospective problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give treatment to one group that others might perceive to be special could cause a "me, too" problem. As one who has a keen interest in motor racing, the hon. Gentleman might be aware of large expenditures on track safety. There are parallels, and they should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that the technical deficiencies of the new clause and the discussions that I have mentioned between the Premier League and the Inland Revenue mean that I am not minded to recommend my hon. Friends to support new clause 45.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I anticipated the Minister's point about shopkeepers. I spoke earlier today to the Football Trust, which would be quite happy to specify a named body in any future clause, such as the Premier League. I do not want the principle of the clause to be shot to pieces by what I shall not call legislative nit picking. Shopkeepers are not going to provide money to
	<span class='label label-info column'>874</span>
the Football Trust in the way that the Premier League, with its squillions, would be able to. For that reason, and given that the Minister assures me that matters are still under discussion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

May I raise an important point as we near the final moments of this Finance Bill? I gather that felicitations and greetings are in order, because it is your birthday. I can think of no finer present for one who has chaired our proceedings than their coming to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my thanks to you Mr. Hogg, for the way in which you have chaired our proceedings may I also thank Mr. Hill. The two of you have kept us in good order and, in spite of our many attempts to sail into distant and uncharted waters, and at times more pleasant climes, you kept us going in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proceedings have inevitably taken a physical toll. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire reminded me that I am more bald at the end of the proceedings than I was at the beginning. He and some of his hon. Friends have greyed a little too during our 25 sittings. It has been an exacting operation. We have been properly pressed from the Opposition Benches, but in a correct and fair manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pay tribute on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends to the Committee Clerk and the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff who at the beginning of our proceedings had great difficulty in recording our words. I saw no problem when we got the printed copy and I congratulate and thank them for their efforts. I should also like to thank the officers who have manned the Doors on Divisions. That job was done with care and correctness and I am grateful for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, as has been often remarked by the Opposition, have had a little assistance. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central has a fairly standard formula which he uses to upset us. He comments on the pieces of paper that come from that area that we may not talk about. It is, however, appropriate to put on record our appreciation of the work of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise staff who have kept us well briefed with appropriate words. I also recognise the singular contribution of my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General who dealt ably with matters relating to indirect taxation. I also thank the Economic Secretary. This was her first Bill as a Minister and she acquitted herself to great acclaim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discovered three new seats of learning during our proceedings. From Rotherham the new school of economics has entertained us with new and diverse views of the economic sphere. In York a school of film making is certainly in the offing, and in Sheffield, as we learned only this afternoon, there will be a school of environmental studies. I hope that the hon. Members for Rotherham, Hillsborough and York
	<span class='label label-info column'>878</span>
will spend more time there than perhaps with us in future proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to thank my right hon. and hon. Friends who have ably supported and at times pressed us. I am grateful for their contributions to our proceedings. Finally, I turn to my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox). As we have discussed films it would be improper of me not to acknowledge his singular contribution in one of the great non-speaking roles of all time. If "Silent Running" is ever remade I shall put him forward for the starring role. I am again grateful for your chairmanship of this Committee, Mr. Hogg, and that of Mr. Hill. You have brought our proceedings to a timely and successful conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I join in congratulating you on your birthday. We all wish you a happy birthday and would sing it if we could. If we had taken cogniscance of this sufficiently early we could have arranged to go on longer so that you could carry on enjoying yourself a bit more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are most grateful to you and Mr. Hill for your wisdom, firmness and fairness in chairing our proceedings. The way that you have led us in our deliberations has contributed to the good humour in Committee, which has gone some way to compensate for the contents of the Bill. In fairness, we would all agree that it has not been the most interesting Finance Bill ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Clerk and his colleagues for their invaluable advice. On this occasion, perhaps by way of rehearsal, we can also express our thanks to the officials, especially those from the Inland Revenue who provided us with briefings which helped to dispel the clouds of ignorance surrounding loan relationships and informed our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff for their customary skill in making sense of our proceedings even when there was little to find. We are grateful to the attendants and Doorkeepers, and to the police officers who have done their job with due and proper diligence. They have succeeded in keeping at bay the public clamour to hear more about loan relationships and self-assessment which threatened to get out of hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our thanks go to those who have advised Opposition Members, and to our office staffs who provided us with research briefings. We are forever in their debt, especially with a Bill such as this which has a high technical content. They have had to work hard to match their wits and ours against the combined might of the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, but they have served us well.

In an otherwise unexciting Bill, there has been one first in that this is the first Committee in which the Chief Secretary has had nothing to say—except in a formal sense. On about 20 occasions he delivered all his formulae—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We appreciated his hard work and the answers that he and his colleagues gave—when they gave them!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a special thank you for my hon. Friends on the Front and Back Benches. It says much for their originality that they found much of quality to say on an otherwise dull Bill. I heard what the Financial Secretary said about his being grey and about his colleagues being worn down by the exacting nature of the Finance Bill. Rest for them will come in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hogg. I said at the outset that my colleague and I would not detain the Committee other than through matters that we wished to raise. We did not prolong debates. Judging by the puzzled look on the Whips' faces, we have maintained our independence of mind in Committee and have not been predictable to either side. I echo the thanks and appreciation that were expressed by hon. Members on both Front Benches sincerely but without repetition. May I also wish you
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
many happy returns on your birthday, Mr. Hogg, although not on the Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their kind remarks. My increasing age and growing frailty make it imperative that Bills do not take as long as they once did. I was delighted that, despite being a large Bill, the Finance Bill took only 25 sittings. I shall convey to Mr. Hill the kind remarks that were made. I have struck up a friendship with Mr. Hill. We exchange letters—all of which he ignores. He comes to me and says, "That arrangement won't do. I'll do the morning." We get on famously and I look forward to chairing other Committees with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank Bill Proctor and Frank Cranmer for their assistance to me. Members of the Committee will have gathered that although I recite lines quickly I do not really know what they mean. The art of being a good Chairman lies in the style: others know and understand the procedure. I am giving away the secrets of the trade. I look foward to coming Finance Bills, and I thank members of the Committee for their kind remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
