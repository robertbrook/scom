ATTENDANCE AT INFORMATION MEETINGS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>7th May</i>]: No. 1, in page 5, line 38, after 'apply', insert "; and—
<br><blockquote><p>(d) about the provision of information in relevant languages, and in circumstances which make such information accessible to person taking into account their cultural and religious requirements."—[<i>Mrs. Roche.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my voice in support of the amendment. It is right and proper that we should cater for different cultures and languages. My first language is Welsh, so I have a special personal interest. I just want to flag up the point that it is important that the amendment be considered and added to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Jonathan Evans—who is also Welsh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But, sadly, not a Welsh speaker.<br><br>
It is the intention of the Lord Chancellor's Department to ensure that the factors to which the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) has drawn attention are taken into account in the provision of information. However, as drafted, the amendment is too wide to be capable of sensible implementation. Even if it were not, by making further additions to clause 8(6), which specifies certain areas that may be covered by regulation, the inference may be drawn that that list is exhaustive and, accordingly, excludes other considerations.<br><br>
It has always been the intention that regulations governing information meetings would be developed as a result of findings from the pilot exercise, which still seems to be the most sensible way of operating. As such matters are new to divorce legislation, it would seem wise to test what is the most appropriate and effective way in which to disseminate information before committing ourselves to detailed provisions in regulation.<br><br>
The current stipulations under clause 8(6) are intended to give a general indication of the sort of matters with which regulations may deal, and I do not believe that greater specified detail would be particularly helpful at this stage. Nothing in clause 8 would preclude regulations from being made along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Hornsey and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
Wood Green. Indeed, the Welsh Language Act 1993, which I had the pleasure of discussing in Standing Committee with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), already requires information at information meetings to be in Welsh, without the addition to which the hon. Gentleman referred. In other words, he and I agree on the outcome, but whether we need to bring about a change in the provisions to achieve it is questionable.<br><br>
Another aspect that I find decisive is the remark made by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green when she moved the amendment. She said that we must take into account cultural and religious requirements. I am certain that that practice will be exercised in the Lord Chancellor's Department. Some members of the Committee may have missed this, but she said that more than 140 languages are spoken in her borough of Haringey. She seemed to be suggesting that we should be arranging for the information to be translated into those 140 languages. I am not sure whether that was a practical proposition, but if that is how the amendment should be interpreted, it is another reason why I cannot recommend it to the Committee.<br><br>
I hope that my earlier remarks reassured the hon. Lady that it is the intention of the Lord Chancellor's Department that the factors to which she referred will be taken into account in relation to the information meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly pleased that, at the very least, the Minister recognises the importance of being sensitive to different cultures and to the fact that we live in multiracial Britain; and to the fact that there should be provision for minority languages. I am disappointed, however, that he is not able to accept the amendment. I spoke of the more than 140 languages not for the reasons supposed by the Minister but to make the Committee aware of the complexity of the problem. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and the Minister spoke about the Welsh language, but languages such as Hindi and Urdu are not protected by Acts of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Lady that the Lord Chancellor's Department intends that the information will be available in the main ethnic languages—even if those languages do not enjoy the same protection and status as the Welsh language. When the hon. Lady mentioned the 140 languages spoken in Haringey, she said that if the information could not be translated to fit in with those, we should find ourselves in a "complete and utter shambles". We are endeavouring to provide the information in the main ethnic languages, but it would clearly be wrong to expect the degree of detail that I inferred from the hon. Lady's words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The important thing is that the principle should be stated firmly in the Bill. We may debate the regulations later, but it is important that the Bill should contain some general principles about information meetings. I said at the outset that we are dealing with untried and untested methods. It is vital that the Committee, which has been charged by the House with examining the Bill in detail—clause by clause and line
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
by line—should consider what information meetings should be.<br><br>
The Minister said that there will be a number of pilot projects, but he has not replied to my earlier questions about them. Will they make any provision for the use of minority languages? I mentioned the more than 140 languages in my area to discover how they would be dealt with. What thought has the Lord Chancellor's Department given to the matter, and will such problems be considered in the pilot projects? More important, what thought is the Lord Chancellor's Department giving to the different cultural traditions in such communities? I mentioned Muslim women as an example, because they might find it difficult to attend information meetings. The amendment is not about language only; it is about different traditions and customs. It is important that we respect those differences.<br><br>
I am puzzled by the Minister's remark that the amendment is too far-ranging because, almost in the same breath, he said that it might be unduly prescriptive. That was a challenging remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If one draws up a schedule of things to be included, it is capable of being interpreted in such a way that matters that are not included are excluded from the legislation. I am sorry that the hon. Lady does not appear to take that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says, but he is being contradictory. He is saying that the amendment is all-embracing and also that it will be too prescriptive. I believe that it gets the balance right; it deals with language and cultural and religious traditions. It would enable the Lord Chancellor's Department, in its pilot projects, to examine what could be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there not another important issue relating to language and the dissemination and collection of information? The paragraph proposed in the amendment should appear in the Bill, not least to ensure that those present at an information meeting in an official role—that is, people other than those who want to end their marriage—should have a responsibility to ensure that there is someone present who can move easily between the languages that reflect the multi-cultural and multiethnic nature of our society.<br><br>
I am sure that all Committee members will know of constituents whose asylum and immigration claims have been badly damaged because the solicitors whom they approached, perhaps because of a national link, failed to understand them. There is a responsibility not only on those who are pleading, but on those who are disseminating the information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. She will know from her constituency experience—I have the pleasure of sharing a constituency border with her—what difficulties there are in such matters, and she rightly alluded to the Asylum and Immigration Bill.<br><br>
Although we are talking about provision in a number of languages, some people can speak several. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
Minister was talking in extremes, conjuring up the idea of 140 different languages—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You conjured up the 140.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to intervene from a sedentary position. The spin that he puts on what I said—that there would have to be 140 separate interpreters—is nonsense. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) said, there are people who can move between a number of minority languages.<br><br>
The amendment was tabled in a spirit of helpfulness. We believe that it will add substance to the clause and the untried and untested information meetings. It certainly should be considered during the pilot projects. Because the Minister has not given the assurances that I seek, I ask my hon. Friends to support the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 5, line 38, after "apply", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"; and—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(e) about the provision of information in circumstances that uphold the dignity and status of the institution of marriage, and the safety of parties.".</p></blockquote>
I shall endeavour once again to tease out from the Minister some detail about the nature of information meetings and the pilot projects. The amendment refers to the dignity of marriage and the need, when conducting information meetings and providing information, to preserve the dignity of the institution of marriage and the safety of those attending.<br><br>
On Second Reading, and during our discussion of clauses 5 and 7 on the Floor of the House, it was universally agreed that it is essential in such trying and difficult circumstances that we preserve the dignity of the institution of marriage and are sensitive to people who are about to go through a very difficult process. That is why it is so important that that principle is stated for the conduct of information meetings. We contend that the Committee has a duty to ensure that that happens.<br><br>
How will we ensure that meetings are conducted so as to uphold the dignity of the institution of marriage?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
What will be the nature of the different pilot projects? In which areas will the pilot projects be held? How will we ensure the safety of those attending information meetings?<br><br>
We had a detailed debate about the need to safeguard spouses and children from violence in marriage, in which we expressed major concern about the tragic extent of violence in marriage and the need to protect spouses—mainly women, who are the main victims of domestic violence—and children from violence. It is not impossible to imagine in cases of very violent relationships and marriages, where a woman may have been in an impossible situation for years, that the mere fact of her having the temerity to attend an information meeting—as I said, we do not even know what form such meetings will take—will expose her to risk. That may deter many people from taking the step, even when they want to. That is why it is incumbent on the Minister to spell out in rather more detail how he intends such meetings to operate and how the pilot projects will work. It is simply not good enough to say that there will be a number of pilot projects. The Committee is charged by the House with the heavy responsibility of considering the Bill in detail. The Minister must tell the Committee how the system will operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wholeheartedly support the amendment and the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. I, too, am concerned that the Minster should respond.<br><br>
I am a little more concerned about the practicalities of information meetings. For example, when parties leave the marital home, the woman usually has responsibility for the children. If that woman were required to attend an information meeting and had to take small children with her because there was no one with whom she could leave them, would a creche be provided? Does the Lord Chancellor's Department regard buildings as part and parcel of the pilot scheme?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green spoke of the concern that all members of the Committee feel about the possibility of violence being visited on women because of the nature of information meetings. The partners in a marriage that is being dissolved might be meeting for the first time after a considerable period of deliberate separation because of the threat and fear of violence to the woman. That woman might have to take her children with her to such meetings. It is not too excessive to say that, in some cases, the mother—in the knowledge that the father of her children will be there—will be genuinely afraid that the children might be snatched from her.<br><br>
We are talking not only about security within the building in which an information meeting takes place, but how the woman moves herself and her children—I have little doubt that it will be incumbent on her to have them with her—into that building. We are also talking about whether those children will be kept safely and securely—if, indeed, the Lord Chancellor thinks that facilities for children must be provided. I would argue that such facilities must be provided.<br><br>
I am sure that all members of the Committee think that it would be entirely wrong for children to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
present at information meetings where the exchanges between their parents might well be violent and abusive. I make no gender distinction here: it is possible for women in such circumstances, if not to be physically violent, to be orally abusive. I could argue that they have good grounds for such an approach. However, children should not be taken into such an atmosphere.<br><br>
When I say that proper facilities for children should be provided, I do not mean small, perhaps windowless, rooms with a couple of chairs, but rooms that are properly secure and contain proper facilities which meet the needs of small and perhaps older children. I hope that the Minister will respond to these practical questions.<br><br>
Language has been mentioned. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of such matters, given the experience of ethnic minorities, especially women, in my constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green mentioned the cultural and traditional requirements of Muslim women. What she said is also true for other ethnic minorities. In my constituency, they find it extremely difficult to move out of their homes on their own.<br><br>
We should do everything that can be done to ease the atmosphere at such meetings. As my hon. Friend said, everyone involved in the meetings must underline the respect that the House is attempting to imbue, via the Bill, in the institution of marriage, and it is important that the physical environment should underline that. The seriousness of what is being engaged in—it is not a minor event—should be acknowledged in its physical representation.<br><br>
I am sure that everyone in the Committee has deep respect for what is being done. We want to see that respect reflected in the structure and the physical location of the meetings, as well as in the people involved. I hope that the Minister will reply to some of those concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment and the previous one are symptomatic of the fact that the core of the Bill has been left very much in the air. The Minister nods, but it should not have been. Although I am pleased to say that I agree with the main thrust of the Bill, as I am sure do most members of the Committee, we cannot wholeheartedly support something about which we know so little. It is only right and proper that vital matters of great moment have been raised during our debates, but such questions need not have been asked had information been available. Why is there no reference in the notes on clauses to what will happen in the meetings? Why is such information absent from the bumper document? This important aspect is dealt with sketchily, leaving so many important questions without answers.<br><br>
One of the main criticisms of the Bill made by several people, many of whom are lawyers, is the amount of delegated legislation that will follow. We do not know what will happen in the future. I fully appreciate that there has to be a pilot, but the Bill has been a long time in gestation—that is quite a good word to use for a family Bill.<br><br>
I am concerned that there is so little information available and I hope that the Minister will do his best to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
ensure that, before the end of our proceedings, we are given far better information about the important matters that have been raised today. If my concerns are not met, I shall have to reserve my position on whether to support the Bill on Third Reading. The Bill may fall flat on its face. I know that the Minister is interested in strengthening the Bill to make it work, so I plead with him to give us information either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. I do not think that it is appropriate for him to say that the proposals will be piloted in some months' time. That will be no use because of the core importance of the matter to the Bill. So I hope that the Minister will give us an undertaking that, before the end of our proceedings, we shall have far more information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy began by telling us that he fully understood what it meant to pilot projects, but the debate has illustrated a divide of understanding across the Committee. I shall do my best to outline the Government's position on the information meetings.<br><br>
We could have taken the view that we knew exactly the best structure for such meetings, set out matters in detail and then provided the costings. The Lord Chancellor has always made it clear, however, that he has responded to the strong view held by hon. Members that there are certain areas of law when new procedures must emanate from trying a variety of pilot projects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us any example in recent history when a measure of such seriousness, with the degree of concern that has been expressed and its potential impact on the fabric of our society, has been introduced on the basis of an unknown, untested, untried pilot project—essentially, on the basis of trust alone?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is importing elements that are not in my proposition. I have made it absolutely clear that the structure of the information meeting, in the sense of what it is for, is well understood. The argument has been about the practical arrangements. Our debate and the variety of amendments show that many people have much to contribute. The Lord Chancellor made it clear in the other place, as I did to the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) that the projects would be piloted. I am surprised that he is surprised, because he welcomed my assurance that we would proceed on that basis.<br><br>
I am being invited to describe the pilot projects in detail before there has been any of the widespread consultation to which I referred. The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate suggested that creches should be available at all information meetings. It is an interesting idea and the first time that I have heard it. It shows the variety of views that there are and will be as the testing of the pilot projects proceeds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says and I think that he is in a hole, so I respectfully suggest that he stop
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
digging. He says that there has been considerable consultation and that various informed and useful ideas have been put to him, so why are such ideas not referred to in the notes on clauses or in some document for the Committee to read? We are concerned that so much is being left to a future date. After all, we have been charged with dealing with the Bill, and information meetings, mediation and other factors are important issues that may not work in the future unless we get them right. We could be debating the son of CSA—the Child Support Agency. The fall-out from a bad Family Law Bill could be even worse than that from the CSA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That contribution was long on rhetoric but short on detail of the complaints about my proposition. [<i>Interruption.</i>] May I respond?<br><br>
The Lord Chancellor decided to proceed by way of consultation and pilot project and, until we heard the cacophony of complaint in Committee this morning, he has been working with the grain of the observations that have been made to him. I am aware of a variety of occasions—I am sure that you, Sir Patrick, with your greater experience could provide a litany of such occasions—when complaints have been made about the Government not proceeding on the basis of pilot projects before schemes were implemented. Invariably, the Opposition turn to that as an explanation for difficulties with measures when they subsequently appear in substantive legislation. I am rather surprised to hear that we should give not only details of the pilot project but, according to the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green at our previous sitting, we must say what the favoured pilot project is. What is the sense of having pilot projects if the Government start by saying what their favoured one will be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really am at a loss to understand the Minister's point. No one is asking him to write into the Bill an outline of each of the pilot schemes that may be proposed. Presumably, his Department must have done some thinking about what the pilot schemes may be, where they may be located and how much they may cost. If some thought has been given to that—if it has not, that is a sign of gross dereliction of the Department's duty and purpose—why will not the Minister share it with us? That is all we are asking—that the Minister share it with the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had made the matter perfectly clear already. Obviously, those areas have been examined by my Department. I am surprised—indeed, I am staggered—that the Opposition criticise the Government because we are prepared to proceed by piloting projects. Yet that appears to be their position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me set the Minister's mind at rest. We do not criticise the Government for consulting; we do not say that they should not be committed to consultation. But they have been consulting about the White Paper, in seminars and in the interdepartmental working group. We are entitled at this stage—within weeks, the Government hope, of the Bill passing into law—to know their preliminary conclusions, or at least the results of their consultations, and their thoughts about the nature of the pilot schemes. Will the Minister share those thoughts with us? We are simply asking him

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
to share with the Committee an outline of some of the pilot schemes that are proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We propose, after passage of the Bill, if that is what the House determines, further to consult, and then to put pilot projects into effect. During the debate, a number of areas that those pilot projects need to cover have been raised by members of the Committee.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon Member for Hornsey and Wood Green did not take my response to her remarks about the need for cultural and religious diversity to be taken into account in the spirit in which it was intended. Clearly, that will be an important aspect of drawing up pilot projects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say that the Government want the Bill—which will place a requirement on individuals who want to end their marriage—to pass into law before those individuals are told how the information schemes will be implemented? That is extraordinary. You are placing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Sir Patrick. It is extraordinary that the Minister can contemplate passing into statute a requirement on citizens without there being in place any means for them even to begin to fulfil that requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can at least reassure the hon. Lady that it has been made clear throughout that implementation will take approximately two years from Royal Assent. We must proceed by piloting schemes for information meetings. As has already been highlighted, the detail of other matters in relation to the Bill will need to be the subject of widespread consultation. We are endeavouring to proceed on that basis, and I am amazed that that is the subject of complaint from the Opposition this morning. I had hoped to be able to reassure Opposition members of the Committee, but I am bound to say that the chasm between us has grown wider, which astonishes me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The core of our objection is that, normally, when Governments consult, they use the results of the consultation to legislate. In this case, the Government are legislating and then consulting, which does not make a lot of sense. If the Minister disagrees so vehemently and if, as he said, he has had numerous consultations, may I invite him, with the greatest respect, to tell the Committee the minimum requirements—child facilities, languages and so on—that he favours for information meetings? That would at least be a help, and it would defuse the situation slightly if we were given some more information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said, in response to the point raised by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, that we must ensure that issues relating to cultural and religious diversity are taken into account at information meetings.<br><br>
We are debating a specific proposal, but we shall shortly be discussing amendment No. 5, which deals with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"the availability of support for victims of domestic violence."</p></blockquote>
Given the general character of the points that are being raised, I hope that I will be given some indulgence to trespass beyond the amendment that we are considering, and say that I do not believe that the wording of amendment No. 5 is the most desirable. I have met representatives of the Women's Aid Federation of England, who have proposed another form of words to cover the matter.<br><br>
We shall need to take into account such matters when we consider the structure of the information meetings. I repeat that the Bill was the subject of widespread consultation before it came to the House of Commons. That consultation related to the specific detail of how the information meeting will be structured. Before this morning, that policy had not been the subject of any criticism of which I am aware. That is why I am surprised at the interventions and contributions that have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong. We are entitled to be critical when seeking information. We are charged with dealing with the Bill in Committee, but we are leaving too much to chance. We want to introduce good law, but we cannot say that we have done that if we do not know half the story.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs to take into account the fact that all Bills involve an element of primary legislation and an element of secondary legislation. In debate, it is relevant for Committee members to decide whether matters should be dealt with on a primary basis or on a secondary basis—through regulation after consultation.<br><br>
The Government's stance on this aspect of the information meetings has always been made clear. The debate today has called that stance into question, but as far as I am aware, the Government's position has been welcomed by most organisations active in the field, and I commend the Government's approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's speech absolutely staggering. There is no reason whatever why he should be astonished or surprised that we have raised such issues today. On Second Reading, both my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South and I mentioned information meetings. I clearly remember asking the Minister, during my winding-up speech, what the details of the information meetings would be. I recollect that on that occasion, too, the Minister did not reply.<br><br>
In considering clause 8, we are not dealing with a mere technicality or addition to be examined by the House by way of statutory instrument. We are talking about a crucial aspect of the Bill—the information meeting, which is untried and untested. Although the Minister did not say so, his tone implied that we were being impertinent when we posed relevant questions. When he reflects on his comments, he will have cause to regret them.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I also noted that the Minister did not address the clause, which deals with information meetings as a means of preserving the dignity of the institution of marriage. I did not hear one word about that principle, or about the safety of those attending the meeting.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0104">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
During this short but extremely significant debate, we have heard several important contributions. My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate rightly mentioned creche facilities which, according to the Minister, were an interesting and novel idea. Children have been with us for a considerable number of years, so provision for children is not a novel idea, but it is evidently new to the Lord Chancellor's department. My hon. Friend also mentioned physical safety and the provision of buildings.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy made a number of pertinent and telling points when he said that the Government were legislating and then consulting. The Minister said, first, that the Government would legislate first and consult during the two-year period; then a minute or two later he tried to deny that that is what the Government were doing.<br><br>
The Bill has not suddenly come before the House. The idea has been with the Lord Chancellor's department for a very long time. We are entitled to ask about the pilot projects. Is the Minister honestly telling us that he can give us no detail whatever? Is he saying that we are not entitled to know the thinking of the Lord Chancellor's Department? Is he saying that the Department has no favoured plan for the meetings, although they are to be piloted? He implies that the Lord Chancellor's Department is an idea-free zone and that we can be told nothing.<br><br>
When we tabled these rather innocuous and helpful amendments, I did not realise that the Committee and the House had been asked to consider a Bill which, in some respects, has been badly thought through. At the beginning of the Bill's passage through Parliament, we were told that it would be approached in the spirit of inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree, taking into account the consultation that was alleged to have taken place, that the amount of information now forthcoming from the Government on important aspects of the Bill compares oddly with the amount of detailed work that the Government undertook on the matter of pension splitting, where a financial aspect was involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, once again the hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent point. If the Minister wants to intervene, I shall be happy to give way. Furthermore, his approach to this series of amendments contrasts tellingly with the Government's approach to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gary Streeter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Whip says, "Hear, hear", and rightly so, because it is his job to get the Bill through as quickly as possible without having regard to the important task with which we are charged, which is to make sure that we get it right. The Bill is about the wellbeing of family life. Bearing that in mind and the Minister's failure to give us any assurances, I urge my hon. Friends to support the amendment.</span></p>

<p>Chairman's vote cast with Noes.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In accordance with the rules applying to the casting vote of the Chair—I am not expressing a personal opinion—I cast my vote with the Noes.</span></p>
<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 6, line 4, after "advice", insert "and representation".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 4, in page 6, line 5, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(h) the provisions of the legal aid scheme governing eligibility for legal advice and assistance, representation and mediation during the divorce or separation process.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although it might be unusual for someone engaged in political life, I am an optimist and, once again, I live in hope that the Minister will give us some information and assurances.<br><br>
The amendments would ensure that people attending information meetings are advised of the possibility of access to legal representation and legal advice. If the appropriate criteria are satisfied, advice would also be available under the legal aid scheme. There is a great deal of disquiet about the provisions, much of it among professional organisations such as the Law Society. Parties embarking on divorce proceedings and attending information meetings may be in unequal bargaining positions. One spouse might need access to legal advice and representation. Mediation cannot fulfil that requirement because, by its very nature, it is not partisan; mediation seeks a resolution, a result. The process leads ultimately to divorce and one of the parties may need legal advice. It is therefore appropriate that, rather than leaving it to a variety of as yet unknown and unspecified pilot projects, we should make it clear in the Bill that regulations will provide not only legal advice but representation. It is also important to point out that legal aid may be appropriate in such cases.<br><br>
The amendments are intended to be helpful and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always endeavour to respond positively to invitations to address the Committee on amendments moved in that spirit. There is a difference in character between the amendments that we are now considering and those that we debated earlier. The matters that we discussed earlier may have had different
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
connotations in the context of the pilot projects, but I shall not reopen that debate. However, it is clear that parties who attend information meetings need advice about the availability of legal services.<br><br>
The problem with the drafting of the amendments is whether they extend to giving advice about the eligibility of individuals for legal aid in certain circumstances. Hitherto, it has been understood that that advice should be given by solicitors. The amendments are unclear on that point, so I will have to give the matter further consideration. However, I can indicate to the Committee that my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor has always made it clear that green form legal advice will continue to be available to people in such circumstances. Clearly, making people aware of their entitlement to legal advice is a core matter to be considered at information meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Minister. It is quite right that information about the legal aid scheme is given; leaflets are produced by the Lord Chancellor's Department about the scheme. Could such leaflets and other information be made available at information meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I anticipate that that could happen, but we are debating whether such a provision should be written into the Bill. I do not want to damage the spirit of compromise because I believe that the aim could be achieved. However, it could not be achieved with the amendment as it stands. I am certainly prepared to consider the matter and return to it on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the availability of green form legal advice also include representation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Legal advice will continue to be available under the provisions of the Legal Aid Act 1988 to parties who are contemplating divorce. I mentioned green form advice but, as the hon. Gentleman probably knows, the structure of legal aid and the way that advice is delivered is currently under revision by the Lord Chancellor's Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not labouring the point, but the Minister will know that under the green form scheme people have a right to legal advice. People have a right to legal advice and representation. The amendment would provide for representation. Can the Minister give us an assurance that representation will be made available? I do not expect him to tell us today, but I would be grateful if he could tell us at some point.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have said that it is our intention that legal advice continues to be available under the provisions of the Legal Aid Act. One reason why I do not want to respond in detail to the hon. Gentleman's specific point is that, as he will be aware, the structure of legal aid has been the subject of a wide-scale review within the Lord Chancellor's Department. The way in which such advice is offered may well change in future, but it is certainly our intention to ensure that legal advice continues to be available under the Legal Aid Act for parties contemplating divorce.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
Obviously, such change will be a matter for the House to decide, but whatever structure is ultimately decided upon by the House, it is important that the availability of legal aid services be made clear at the information meeting. I think that that is in the spirit of the hon. Lady's amendment. I shall certainly reconsider the issue to see whether we can return on Report with an acceptable form of words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for those assurances. In that spirit, and bearing in mind that the Minister will reconsider the matter and return to it on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked—and have readily agreed—that we should have a debate on clause stand part. Because of that and because amendment No. 5, which we shall discuss next, deals with a very specific matter, I ask members of the Committee not to stray beyond it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 6, line 5, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(i) the availability of support for victims of domestic violence.".</p></blockquote>
This is an extremely important amendment that would ensure that support for victims of domestic violence is available at information meetings. We had a long and detailed debate on an earlier amendment about the desirability of writing into the Bill the principle of ensuring that violence to spouses and children is avoided. During that debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South was challenged to give concrete examples of what that principle would mean in practice. He spent some time doing so. The amendment is another example of what that principle would mean in practice. It is important that such information is available at the information meeting.<br><br>
The Women's Aid Federation says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If domestic violence issues are not clearly acknowledged at all stages of the process, then many victims who have not disclosed abuse will be unaware of the protective measures available to them."</p></blockquote>
We certainly share that view and the amendment provides a practical means of ensuring that that information is available. Good information about refuge provision is now available locally—and sometimes nationally—but it is vital to explain in information meetings what is available and what can happen.<br><br>
The excellent work of police forces around the country in the important area of domestic violence has also been mentioned. There are domestic violence units and vulnerable persons units with dedicated police oficers devoted to their task. It is also important that people coming to information meetings are made aware of the units and of the support and strong advice that they can offer.<br><br>
This is another important amendment. It was tabled in the spirit of helpfulness, to contribute something to the information meeting process. I look forward to the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is again at her most seductive in inviting me to respond to the tone of her speech in raising such important issues. Yesterday, I met representatives of the Women's Aid Federation—

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
[<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) want to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's remark interesting, even though the meeting was a bit late in the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is being slightly churlish. I am tempted to be not quite so churlish by saying that I mentioned some of the points that she raised in her discussions with them and that my understanding of their views does not totally coincide with her account of their views.<br><br>
Those representatives told me that they had been trying to persuade Opposition Members to table an amendment that was more specific than amendment No. 5. Their proposed amendment, of which I have a copy, is slightly more helpful than amendment No. 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to it in a moment, if I may; perhaps the hon. Gentleman can contain himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just enthusiastic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always pleased to see the hon. Gentleman enthusiastic, but I despair of seeing him being too gracious.<br><br>
Amendment No. 5 deals with the availability of support for victims of domestic violence. One of my concerns is that it is too general and does not state whether that support would involve availability of women's refuges or advice on how steps can be taken to protect oneself against domestic violence. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Brent, South shouts "Both".<br><br>
The amendment proposed by the Women's Aid Federation suggests that information should be provided, but that rights to protection should he covered under part IV of the Bill. The federation told me that it did not believe that what it calls "safety support services" should be limited to women's refuges, which is what the hon. Gentleman's sedentary remark seemed to suggest. It believed that the services offered by victim support schemes might also be helpful. That would be a useful point for us to take on board.<br><br>
I told the Women's Aid representatives that I found their suggested provisions clearer than amendment No. 5 on the matter of information. Having said that, I have to be satisfied about the drafting and whether "safety support services" would include victim support schemes and similar advice.<br><br>
I am prepared to consider the points made by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green in the light of the suggestions made by the Women's Aid Federation. I shall return to the matter on Report in the context of the availability of legal advice—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled about one aspect of the Minister's remarks. Amendment No. 5 deals with
<br><blockquote><p>"the availability of support for victims of domestic violence."</p></blockquote>
One would hope that that included victim support schemes, which are vital in this matter. I am sure that all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
hon. Members will want to pay tribute to the work of victim support schemes across the country, which do a very good job.<br><br>
Amendment No. 5 includes refuges, victim support schemes and police domestic violence units, all of which have a part to play, so I was perplexed by the Minister's interpretation of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for clarifying that. I was relying on the sedentary intervention of the hon. Member for Brent, South, who told us that he agreed with women's refuges—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span> rose—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have an intervention on an intervention. The hon. Lady has the floor. She gave way to the Minister. We cannot have a jack-in-the-box jumping up and down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that we now seem to be on all fours in our approach to the matter. I am glad that the Minister has had his discussion, and I am sure that he is grateful to the Opposition for raising the issue. It is extremely important and will be helpful to victims of domestic violence, who may come to the meetings not knowing where to go for advice. If the Minister returns to the matter with proposals on Report, it is possible that women will gain access to advice and information from the bodies that have been mentioned and from others. Given the assurance that the Minister and his Department will consider the matter further and come back on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come now to amendment No. 94—another moment of glory for the Gainsborough boy.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 94, in page 6, line 8, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8A) A person who would not be required to make any contribution towards mediation provided for him under Part IIIA of the Legal Aid Act 1988 shall not be required to make any contribution towards the cost of a meeting with a marriage counsellor arranged for him under this section.".—[<i>Mr. Leigh.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether to celebrate the fact that I have been described as a jack-in-the-box or to commiserate with the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle in his new light as the Gainsborough boy. Those descriptions, Sir Patrick, are taken in good heart by both of us.<br><br>
It is good to be able to make some general comments about the clause. The last two contributions from the Minister are to be welcomed because they recognised the importance of ensuring that the information meeting is a valuable means of bringing to the attention of a party in crisis the availability of a range of legal services, which must be available to that party if justice is to be done. It is also important, where relevant, to bring to the party's attention the availability of a range
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0107">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
of support services for the victims of domestic violence. The purpose of the amendments we tabled was to get that written into the Bill. I welcome the Minister's undertaking to consider that purpose and to return to it on Report to see how it can be best effected. We shall examine his proposals carefully.<br><br>
It was said in an earlier debate that the Government's approach to the clause represented something of a touchstone—a litmus test—for us, which will affect our capacity to support the Bill through its remaining stages. As members of all opposition parties have said this morning, the Opposition's abiding concern about the Bill is that so much that is vital is left unsaid.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
It is one thing for much that is vital to have been left unsaid, but it is another—indeed it is alarming—that so much, as the Minister has said, has been left undone. It is one thing not to say, but quite another not to do. The Opposition intend to press the Minister on this matter again and again because we do not understand why he is so reluctant. I suspect that the Government's intention—perhaps even the Department's intention, as a battle has undoubtedly gone on between it and the Treasury—is to paint as broad and unclear a picture as possible in the hope that it will not depredate the Treasury's budget.<br><br>
Whitehall is playing a game. The Lord Chancellor's Department and the Treasury can play their games, but we are not prepared to allow parties in crisis and their children to be the victims of the failure to resolve the issue now. We must know how much money is intended to be spent on the pilot projects. We want to know how much money has been set aside to monitor those projects. How much will information sessions cost? Where will the money come from?<br><br>
Let me make it absolutely clear that the Opposition do not intend to give the Government a blank cheque for information meetings. We have a duty to the taxpayer and we intend to fulfil it. There should be no illusions about our concerns on the matter. I am anxious that the Minister should write this down. He must write down the phrases "no blank cheques" and "we will fulfil our duty to the taxpayer". I do not use those phrases in any spirit other than one of the utmost seriousness.<br><br>
Our concerns about the failure to cost the Bill remain and will play an important part in our ultimate approach to the remaining clauses. The Opposition understand why the Government do not say anything, but we are not prepared to accept that they have not done anything.<br><br>
This morning's most revealing exchange was that about children between the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate. It beggars belief that those responsible for introducing proposals on information sessions thought that today's sitting would be the first time that the Minister had heard of the potential need to make provision for children at such sessions. [<i>Interruption.</i>] If the Minister did not say that, I should be happy to give way. However, Hansard will show that he said that it was new to him that it would be necessary to think about children in connection with information sessions. That is incredible. It is obvious to anyone who considers the practicalities of information sessions that children must be taken into account.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
The majority of petitioners are women—we can presume that that will continue to be the case—and many of them have children. How is information to be given to those women? Are the children to be present in the same room, able to hear what transpires between the person conducting the interview and the parent? It is often desirable that the children should not be present, because if the interviews are to be candid and useful—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) looks surprised and startled—even more so than usual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I look askance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has good cause to look askance. If I sat on the Conservative Benches and looked around me, I, took should look askance. However, I note that when the hon. Lady speaks of her hon. Friends look askance at her. She should not look askance for too long. If she looked askance because I dared to suggest that children might not be present when the relationship between the parents was being dissected, she must have less experience of the real world than I credited her with—and I give her rather a lot of credit for her experience of some aspects of the real world.<br><br>
It is an important and practical question. The Minister seems not to have sat down with his officials and discussed what was meant by information sessions, what should happen at them and where they should be held.<br><br>
Amendment No. 2 is about upholding the dignity and status of the institution of marriage. I hoped that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green would have teased a contribution out of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. To use your expression, Sir Patrick, more glory would thus have been heaped on the head of the Gainsborough boy. I believe that the hon. Gentleman genuinely and sincerely wants to uphold the dignity and status of the institution of marriage, but not once did the Minister deign to address that point. It does not surprise me because I believe that he has not given the matter much thought. Perhaps he should.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I heard someone who is supposed to be silent say "disgraceful". I agree—it is a disgrace that the Minister seems to have given no thought to the matter.<br><br>
The Government have given way on one important aspect—which they were not prepared to do in the other place. We now know that information sessions are to be one-to-one interviews. At least there will be some privacy. We have made some progress. In what circumstances will those interviews take place? I have experienced one-to-one interviews, as have other hon. Members—at Petty France. When we want to renew a passport or collect a new passport for the children, we go to Petty France. There, we have to queue; if fortunate, we can sit in a large hall while waiting for our numbers to flash up-11, 22, 42 or whatever.<br><br>
It may be some time, Sir Patrick, since you have experienced that, but clearly you have done so—as, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0108">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
suspect, other members of the Committee have at some time. The number flashes up after someone has been waiting for ages and then that person trots off to a cubicle and has a private one-to-one interview. If that is what is proposed for information meetings, it is wholly unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be totally unacceptable to me, too, but I am sure that when my hon. Friend the Minister responds he will make it absolutely clear that that is not his intention. It would be absurd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps now we will get something.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has come to a pretty pass when in order to get anything out of the Minister we have to rely on the Gainsborough boy. Nevertheless, that is the reality.—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Billericay has gone from looking askance to tutting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Patrick. Are attempts at character assasination appropriate in our debate? Would you rule on the necessity for hon. Members to stick to the facts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard nothing other than a little affectionate banter, which can only enhance the general affection in which the hon. Lady is held throughout the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Patrick. I quite understand that the Chair cannot hear someone looking askance, but now that you have confirmed that you did not hear a "Tut, tut", should not the hon. Member for Brent, South withdraw his remark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is hardly a point of order, but selective blindness and deafness are necessary attributes of any Chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. We are discussing a serious point and we seek assurances on it. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that the dignity of the institution of marriage will be upheld in the way in which information sessions are held. I can understand the pressure for a Petty France solution because it would be infinitely cheaper to require people to come to their local social security office for information sessions. That would be unacceptable and inappropriate, but it would be the most convenient place because it has waiting areas—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A queuing system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it also has a queuing system, as my hon. Friend reminds me. It also has cubicles.<br><br>
In one sense—a totally wrong sense—a social security office would be the logical place for the Minister to choose as the venue for information sessions. It would, however, be totally inappropriate.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
We seek a cast-iron assurance from the Minister that information sessions will not take place in local social security offices. That, too, will be a litmus test. The Minister smiles, but these questions are going through the minds of countless people outside this place who are desperately concerned about the Bill's provisions and want to know what its implications are for them and their lives.<br><br>
I suspect that the Minister is not able to give any such assurances. That is a real cause for concern. If he assures us that the venue will not be the local social security office, we are entitled to ask where it will be and how much it will cost. Such questions remain unanswered, which gives us real cause for concern.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to know what the costs will be, I suspect that he will have to read the leaked memos in the <i>Daily Mail.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to that inducement to read the <i>Daily Mail.</i> Sometimes inducements to read all sorts of papers are necessary, but I am glad of the specific inducement to read the <i>Daily Mail</i> because I know that it takes a real interest in the deliberations of the Committee and the contributions of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. That newspaper has an unusual capacity to fathom the hon. Gentleman's mind, which is also of interest to those who follow the proceedings closely.<br><br>
However, we have not been privy to the contents of the Minister's mind. Time and again, a feature of his contributions has been bland assurances of better things to come, but never concrete satisfaction on the practical solutions and suggestions that our amendments demand. It is not enough for the Minister to suggest that they are matters on which we will consult after the passage of the Bill. That is a disingenuous response because we know—it was referred to last Tuesday—that in November 1995 a consortium of organisations concerned about the content of the information sessions got together and developed some criteria. We know that such meetings occurred—it was not a matter of the Minister making a last-minute entry in his diary. Meetings took place in the latter part of last year between the Minister's officials and people working in the field about the content of the information meetings, the practical challenges and the criteria for success. Work must have been done in the Minister's Department and it is his duty to give us some insights into his Department's thinking on the practical challenges that clause 8 presents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend the Minister give an assurance that in the interim between now and the Bill being enacted, financial provision will be made to enable those organisations that already provide services not only to continue their work at the level that they do now, but to finance the considerable expansion in the number of people that they will need to take on and train, so that they are up and running and able to build on their considerable experience? Such an assurance is necessary, and would be very welcome to organisations such as National Family Mediation.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South put his finger on the central concerns about which Opposition Committee members feel strongly—the how, where, by whom and in what circumstances information meetings will be carried out, and now information will be disseminated. I find it astonishing that the Government are contemplating introducing a statutory requirement without telling the Committee or the people of this country how they will meet that requirement.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South gave a graphic description of what I believe to be the Government's thinking. Information will be given in social security offices, which are not only uncomfortable, but sometimes dangerous. People will have to wait a long time to receive a ticket to sit in a booth where the conversation is by no means private, as staff, for their own protection, are increasingly having to sit behind a glass screen. It is not possible to have a quiet conversation in such circumstances, which are totally unacceptable.<br><br>
The House has shown itself to be committed to underlining the fact that, although the Bill is about the breakdown of marriage, it should reinforce the respect for the institution of marriage. Although we cannot know where the information sessions will be held yet, the Government have not even given details of the costs of providing additional physical locations in which to hold the meetings or of the requirement to increase the number of people to disseminate the information.<br><br>
Another alternative that the Government might be considering is that existing information offices, such as citizens advice bureaux, will be able easily to pass on information. However, CAB offices and staff—certainly in my constituency—are already vastly overstretched and overstrained. It is virtually impossible now for someone simply to walk in to a CAB office and ask for information; because of the pressure on those offices, they invariably only offer appointments over the telephone. As has already been said, it is difficult for many women who might be seeking to end their marriage to have access to a telephone—it seems easily obtainable to us.<br><br>
I share the astonishment of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South at the fact that the Minister has not considered the possibility that there will need to be facilities at information sessions specifically for children. We have not yet touched on the matter in detail, but the Bill should require that children be given information which they can understand and in circumstances that they do not find threatening. They need to have explained a situation that so many of them find bewildering.<br><br>
Is that something which the Government are considering? Will such facilities be provided? Have the Government estimated the cost of the physical provision of such facilities and of the number of people who would be required to provide the information? It is not possible to stress strongly enough the underlying issue of how one protects from violence not only the woman who is most centrally involved but her family. We have all had enough experience to know they suffer violence, too, in such circumstances. No doubt the Government will make such a provision a statutory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
requirement, yet it is astonishing that we have been given no details of how individuals will meet such a requirement.<br><br>
I am still not clear about the time scale. Can the Minister clarify the position? He spoke about it being two years after the Bill received Royal Assent, after which time there would be a period of consultation before details are given about the information. Is that a way of extending, in a curious way, the already statutory time scale before a marriage can be deemed to have ended?<br><br>
I refer to the Minister's complete inability to deal with amendment No. 2 concerning respect for the institution of marriage. We must buttress that, but the idea that information should be given via the means of standing in a queue, receiving a ticket and given an information pack and told to go home is not how the House would wish us to proceed; nor would the country find it acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we can resolve the matter. We already know that the meetings will take place on a one-to-one basis with a qualified independent person. I understand the Minister's predicament. It is difficult to put more on the face of the Bill, but, surely, he could give us an assurance today that, consistent with the dignity of marriage, the meetings will be held in dignified surroundings such as in an office of a registrar of births, deaths and marriages or in dignified local government premises. They will be held in a private room and there is no question of people queuing outside a cubicle. I do not think, for a moment, that the Minister ever envisaged that. It would be an absurd situation. However, surely it is easy for the Minister to give us reassurances today, without putting them on the face of the Bill, which I accept is impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is probably the most important part of the Bill. The hon. Member for Brent, South said that he was staggered by what the Minister said, while, in turn, the Minister said that he was staggered by the words of the hon. Gentleman. There has been more staggering this morning than at a rugby club dinner.<br><br>
I come now to a more sober note. We are discussing the core of the Bill and I wish to stress the importance of ensuring that there is protection against domestic violence. To be fair, the Minister referred to his discussions with the Women's Aid Federation and he will know that it wants such a provision built into the Bill. I accept that he has conceded that a provision along those lines will be proposed on Report. That is important.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said that the Minister did not intend this, that or the other. The mere fact that we do not know the Minister's intentions leads us to question such matters, which is a normal approach to take in such circumstances. The hon. Gentleman is a reasonable man, so I plead with him to return before the end of our proceedings with a great deal of information on what is the core principle of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting, but it was my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle who, in a few words,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
dealt with the core issue. The hon. Member for Brent, South said that there must be no blank cheques.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I said that the Opposition would not give the Government a blank cheque.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wrote it down. Mr. Boateng: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman invited me to write down his remarks at the time and respond to them, so I wrote down his words: "There must be no blank cheques."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I said was that, without the costings, we give no blank cheques. The Minister has indeed given a blank cheque because no one knows what he proposes in detail or in practice and what the costings are. I wanted to make it clear to him that the Opposition are not prepared to give blank cheques.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the record will show that the note that I made at the time was an accurate reflection of what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
In no sense is the Committee being invited to give the Government a blank cheque with respect to clause 8. The clause spells out the requirements relating to information meetings but, as I said earlier, the Government believed that it was desirable to proceed on the basis of consensus and piloting, which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy correctly identified as a key aspect of the Bill. We seem to have lost sight of the concept of parliamentary control. Regulations will set the information meetings, and the regulations are subject to the negative resolution procedure of the House.<br><br>
The idea that the Government are being given a blank cheque to set up the information meetings is wrong. I tried to explain earlier that we intended to consult widely, and widespread consultation has taken place. Members of the House and of the Committee have attended meetings such as the British Telecom forum, which examined the way in which information meetings are held in other parts of the world. However, the Government must also take account of what happens in debate in the House. It is right that the Government present legislation on the basis of consultation, but hon. Members are charged with the responsibility of examining ways of strengthening that legislation.<br><br>
When the Government, having listened to debate, agree that a step may be constructive, it is sad that that is seen as caving in. In the course of debate this morning, there were two respects in which I agreed that the Bill could be strengthened. I think that the Committee, in fairness, would recognise that. It is not the case that every provision in the Bill must be carried, as though that were the order of the Government. Bills such as this must be brought before the House so that the House can contribute to strengthening it. I make no apology for that approach.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
In the context of clause 8, that process led my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle to propose that the information meetings be held on a one-to-one basis. Previous discussions and existing structures in other jurisdictions have tended towards group meetings. It is argued that some couples prefer to attend information meetings in a small group, rather than individually. The arguments presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle have been convincing, and the Opposition have also argued for one-to-one meetings. The Government accepted that that change should be made to the clause. That shows how legislation carried through Committee is informed by debate and strengthened by the actions of the House. All the talk about the Government being required to spell out at this stage every precise detail of every matter in the Bill is thereby shown to be wrong.<br><br>
I certainly do not want people to queue up at a window for tickets in order to have what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has properly suggested should be a one-to-one meeting. That is referred to in his amendment and he knows from our discussions how attracted I was to it. The person who is conducting the interview should be seen to be independent, with proper counselling skills.<br><br>
All of that is now included in the Bill. It is entirely contrary to the idea that the Government are endeavouring to create some sort of conveyor-belt structure. I assure the Committee that that is not what I want. Such matters should be conducted in a proper, sensitive way, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle; I am sure other members of the Committee want that as well.<br><br>
I believe that there has been too much posturing in today's debate. In my view and that of the Lord Chancellor, it will be necessary to take on board the further observations that will be made even after the Bill is enacted. I am sure that there will be further observations made by everyone who is interested in the issues. That will inform the way in which the information meetings are structured. Thereafter the regulations cannot be enforced without going through the negative resolution procedure, so the idea that the matter will not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny is wrong.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate that it is not anticipated that we shall have to wait two years for Royal Assent. That thought has occurred to me from time to time when some of our debates have been rather lengthy, but I anticipate that the Government will seek Royal Assent very soon after the Bill has proceeded through the House. The two-year period refers to the time from Royal Assent to the anticipated date of implementation. That period will allow for a proper length of time for the factors that I have outlined to be taken into account. That is the sort of consensual attitude that many people in the country regularly call for from the Government.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say at the outset, to avoid doubt, that the amendments are about child support. However, I shall do my utmost to restrict m y remarks to issues that are relevant to this Bill, to the way the Child Support Agency interfaces with the current matrimonial legislation, and to the court framework that was in place before the Child Support Act 1995. I give that reassurance because I am aware that a debate that strays into the subject of child support could last not just for a couple of sittings, but for the two years to which the Minister referred.<br><br>
We all know the consequences of the agency created by the Child Support Act from our postbags and television. It has already been amended twice by primary legislation, which is unprecedented. The Child Support Agency has been the biggest social policy fiasco for a generation. At the end of September 1995, there were 161,309 cases of child support payment arrears, totalling £738 million. It is likely that £1 billion of child support is owing through the agency. An all-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
party group recently put that estimate to the Minister and he did not dissent.<br><br>
That level of arrears reflects the fact that many people regard the legislation as unacceptable. The same happened with the poll tax-the legislation was passed by the House but it came up against such public opposition that it became virtually unenforceable. The Act was based on a document called "Putting Children First". The title of the document and its general principle-that parents should be responsible for their children—probably reassured many hon. Members that the Act would reflect that. However, in practice the Act has focused exclusively on the financial obligations of the so-called absent parent and has ignored other issues relating to parental responsibility and the discharge of parental obligations which most of us would consider normal and obvious.<br><br>
The child support legislation was underpinned by the conventional wisdom that the court system which it was designed to buttress had failed. I doubt that conventional wisdom. Before the Child Support Agency was established, child maintenance for divorcing couples was dealt with by county courts under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Unmarried people had to resolve maintenance through the magistrates courts—a system which did not work well—but the county court jurisdiction did not fail. The problem was that no organisation or agency had responsibility for enforcement and collection of the sums agreed during the ancillary relief procedure in the county courts.<br><br>
The clean-break mechanism grew up over time in divorce legislation. That break was never supposed to be between parents and children. There has been a good deal of misunderstanding on that point—some of it uninformed, some deliberate—suggesting that clean breaks involved fathers walking away from their children. That was never the intention. The clean break was between the divorcing man and woman. The aim was that, when a marriage ended, the courts should find a solution which ensured that there were no continuing mutual obligations between the parties to the marriage, while making proper arrangements for children.<br><br>
The clean-break system developed to the extent that men were often persuaded to walk away from equity in the former matrimonial home—the sums were sometimes as high as £50,000—to ensure that the mother and children were secure in their accommodation. Family homelessness was clearly to be avoided and the importance of providing a roof over a child's head was recognised. It was acknowledged that women were less economically secure than men and were generally unable to raise capital for a mortgage. Women often get divorced at an age when they are not mortgageable, so that development meant that many men had to start all over again on the housing ladder.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Many factors were taken into account by district judges and county courts when assessing child maintenance, with consideration being given to sums forgone in other respects—clean-break settlements being one of those. Those factors were laid out in section 25 of the 1973 Act. They included the parties' income; their earning capacity; whether the woman was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0112">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
of an age at which she could train to get a better job or to get a job at all; any property owned by the parties; their financial needs and obligations; their ages; the duration of the marriage; whether either was disabled; and the contribution that each had made to the marriage. That last factor recognised the fact that many women who had not worked for some time and had given their time to running the home, supporting the husband in his career, and bringing up the children.<br><br>
The first and paramount consideration in section 25 was whether there was any child of the family who was under 18. That was always the court's paramount consideration when deciding what arrangements should be ordered to be made between divorcing parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a practitioner, the hon. Lady will recall that, under section 41, it was not possible to obtain a decree nisi without having first submitted such arrangements to the judge, and the judge having been satisfied that the children were properly catered for. I understand that that is no longer the case in matrimonial law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; he is correct in that observation. The amendments would ensure that section 41 was amended. Section 41 reassured the courts that proper arrangements would be made for children, and it is a tragedy that those requirements no longer apply.<br><br>
Men often felt that the order to which they had been persuaded to agree was punitive. No one should labour under the misapprehension that the system gave divorcing men an easy ride. Nevertheless, men always said that at least they had had their day in court and that their case had been considered on the facts. One of the tragic effects of the child support legislation on divorce jurisdiction is that the clean break is now becoming harder to agree or to order. Men ask, "Why on earth should I walk away from all that equity if the Child Support Agency is waiting in the wings to take sums from me that will make it impossible for me to start again on the housing ladder?" We all know that the consequence of divorce can be that women are asset rich and income poor while men are income rich and asset poor. With the child support mechanism waiting in the wings, men often faced being asset poor and income poor, and so being unable to start again.<br><br>
That has led to the re-emergence of an order from which the courts had been trying to get away. The order derived from the Martin <i>v.</i> Martin case, in which it was provided that the woman and children could live in the house until such time as the woman either died, remarried or cohabited for a period lasting longer than, say, three or six months. The difficulty with that was that women faced homelessness at an even later age and found it even harder to start again, which caused considerable insecurity within families. It also led to children being asked questions such as, "Is Mummy still seeing uncle David, and does he stay overnight?" in an effort to discover whether the woman was cohabiting. One can only imagine the effect on children of being asked personal questions about matters that are better
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
not drawn to their attention or of being pawns in disputes between their parents.<br><br>
I have been informed by people who practise in the matrimonial courts that it is now much harder to settle cases within the ancillary relief jurisdiction because men say that the future is too uncertain. We are seeing a re-emergence of the Martin order, which will create problems in terms of security of accommodation, and disputes between people who have been divorced for years.<br><br>
The matrimonial jurisdiction dealt much more effectively with self-employed men than does the CSA. Self-employed people can hoodwink the CSA into believing that they are facing penury when the reverse is true. It was often difficult for people to do that within the ancillary relief jurisdiction. I remember a case in the county court when I had parked in the car park and a man in a Porsche had parked beside me. I glanced at him briefly and went into court, where I discovered to my amazement that he was the ex-husband of my client and was self-employed and pleading poverty. I managed to get him to admit in front of the judge that he had parked next to me and that he had a Porsche. The judge did not take kindly to that and made an appropriate order. That was right, but it could not happen with the CSA. I am not against Porsche owners, but I want justice and equity.<br><br>
It is right to acknowledge that the ancillary relief jurisdiction gave considerable discretion to the courts. The recent changes in CSA regulations have given discretion to civil servants in operating a financial formula. The county court system was discretionary, but the discretion followed examination of all the evidence—documentary and oral.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening attentively to the hon. Lady. Was there not a danger that because of the feeling that it was nobody's money, the courts were rather too willing to allow the taxpayer to pick up the tab for arrangements made by the court? That is one reason for the way in which the CSA formula was set and that is not unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem is, and will remain, that in the majority of cases it costs much more to run two households than one. There is only so much money within a marriage and if it is difficult for that money to run two households, that will always be a problem. It is immaterial whether the problem is for the courts or the CSA; the problem remains. The recent changes have given discretion to civil servants who operate in private on the basis of a financial formula.<br><br>
The Lord Chancellor's White Paper, "Looking to the Future", was published in April 1995 and part of it forms the basis of the Bill. It suggests the establishment of a mediation service and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Questions relating to where and with whom the children should live, how contact between the children and the non-resident parents should be organised, how the children are to be financially supported …are all questions which have to be resolved."</p></blockquote>
It states at paragraph 5.7:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mediation is likely to ensure that, by the time the divorce is granted by the court, important issues about the welfare of children, accommodation, finance and property have been tackled and resolved in many if not all cases".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
It says that questions about the children's financial support should be agreed during the mediation process. Clause 9 requires couples to make arrangements for the future, including a declaration that they have negotiated an agreement for their financial arrangements.<br><br>
How do couples and mediators negotiate such agreements with the CSA waiting in the wings? That is the problem. While the Bill requires mediators to get parties to agree settlements that resolve all issues of property, finance and responsibility for the children's needs, that would not be possible while the CSA has separate jurisdiction over the parties' finances and could torpedo them. It would be better to introduce child support into the process so that all financial issues that arise from the dissolution of a marriage can be dealt with together.<br><br>
I am the secretary of the all-party parliamentary child support agency monitoring group—a bit of a mouthful. In July 1994, a cross-party deputation—three Labour Members, three Conservative Members and a Liberal Democrat—met the Secretary of State for Social Security. He was somewhat surprised that we all thought that the CSA should cease its assessment functions and that they should be devolved to another body—we spoke about the possibility of a family court structure. That was before we had seen the White Paper and realised that the Lord Chancellor had referred to matters that might encompass child support.<br><br>
We told the Secretary of State that the agency should of course remain, but that it should only enforce orders and collect funds. We said that it should be there to do the things that did not happen when we had only county court jurisdiction. That would ensure that, once the court had said that the children should receive £40 a week, the money was paid. The Secretary of State looked at us with astonishment and said something interesting. He said that that would require primary legislation; we replied that we would have to keep taking up time on the Floor of the House for primary legislation to amend the Child Support Act 1995 year after year and to make it remotely acceptable. He then said that that would involve liaising with the Lord Chancellor's Department and spoke as if that was on another planet, not just down the road. I see no difficulty in requiring Ministers to talk to each other to ensure that they discharge their responsibilities through social security and matrimonial legislation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 100 would give the court responsibility for ensuring that the agreement is adequate and enforceable, which would prevent collusion. At present there is evidence—although some people might not see it—of parties colluding on a major scale to avoid the CSA. Indeed, the agency is now held in extremely low esteem. I heard an interesting programme on Radio 4 some months ago, which involved young, single, unmarried mothers in my constituency who were asked to keep diaries while they were pregnant. Two of them said that when their child was born they would not put the fathers' names on the birth certificate because they had agreed that they wanted to avoid all the trouble that they had seen other people go through with the CSA. I thought that that was an absolute tragedy. The children were going to have on their birth certificate, under "name of father", what my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
grandfather had and which stigmatised him throughout his life—a line drawn with a ruler. That is not, in any social policy terms, the right and proper thing to do. If the CSA continues with enforcement and collection, that in itself is an important responsibility.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 101 gives the Lord Chancellor powers to make regulations setting out all the factors to which the parties and courts would have to pay regard. They could be similar to those in section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, to which I referred earlier. They could be tightly drawn to ensure that couples who are divorcing, the mediators who help in that process and the courts that have to decide whether the order is appropriate all have clear guidance on all the factors that must be taken into account when assessing child support.<br><br>
It would be right to say that the furore around the CSA has died down—and will die down even more as we approach the general election—but that is not because it is working. It is because many cases have been dropped and more than ever are simply not being taken on.<br><br>
Central to the purpose of my amendment is the fact that it is not possible to separate child support from all the other financial issues and consequences that arise from divorce. We must reinforce parental responsibility and we must say that it is not just about money. The Children Act 1989, which had all-party support, referred time and again to parental responsibility.<br><br>
As a parent, I know that that responsibility will probably not be discharged until my dying day. My children are adults, but I feel that my responsibility to them is as great as it ever was. Although it is not now a day-to-day, continuing responsibility, it is not just about money. It includes regular contact, visits, and a continuing interest in education, hobbies, personal matters and development. In assessing child support, we need objective criteria against which people know their case will be measured. They also need to know, however, that their facts will be treated for what they are—a set of utterly unique circumstances. No two couples have identical financial arrangements, needs or obligations, nor do they have identical domestic responsibilities.<br><br>
Issues of child support and maintenance must be set in a framework of mature resolution of adult disputes and people's ability to provide their children with not only adequate financial support, but emotional and psychological succour. That is not happening now, and it will not happen if the CSA continues to have what I see as a malign influence on divorce jurisdiction. Indeed, if things stay as they are, the Bill's impact will be torpedoed. How many cases will have to be thrown back at the section 41 stage of divorce procedure because a proper agreement has not been negotiated?<br><br>
How does the Minister envisage the child support legislation impacting on current legislation? What did the Lord Chancellor mean when he said that issues of child support should be resolved during the mediation process? Clause 9 requires couples to make a declaration that they have made all their financial arrangements. What does that mean? Does it mean that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
they have to make a declaration about all their financial arrangements, assuming that certain sums will have to be paid to the CSA? Does it mean that the agreement does not have to be finalised until a husband knows how much he will have to pay to the CSA? We have had no guidance from anyone in Government about where the CSA fits in with this Bill. There has been a curious silence about it, as if it did not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making an interesting point, because the CSA legislation was made subject to any other court rulings and superseded any prior agreement. As my hon. Friend said, that has caused all sorts of problems. We have a new Bill, which also deals with financial arrangements and doing what is best for the child, and so on; will that take over the CSA? Which will take precedence in the courts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. The answer is that some—and not just Opposition Members—do not know. I suspect that the Minister may not be too clear about it, which is why the debate is important. One of the things that I have found most distressing about dealing with the matter as a Member of Parliament is the fact that people who had handled their divorce responsibly and who had not entered into divorce lightly—I do not mean to be flippant by parodying the line from the marriage service—and who had tried not to be bitter with each other, for the sake of their children, found that a sort of emotional hand grenade had been tossed into their lives. All the certainties on which they had based the future were gone.<br><br>
Complaints about the CSA have been caricatured as just middle class men moaning about not wanting to pay for their children; that is a gross parody of what has really happened. It has caused terrible mayhem for second families. No system that deals with matters of finance and family relationships will please everybody; there will always be men who feel hard done by in the court system, women who complain that their former spouse is better off than he should be, and second families who feel that they have been badly treated.<br><br>
One of the saddest things that I have come across recently is the evidence from my advice surgery about two second marriages breaking up. The husbands had agreed to clean-break settlements and had conveyed all the interests of the matrimonial home—one of my constituents had conveyed £52,000 equity, knowing that he would never get it back because the wife would live in the house for the rest of her life. He told me that he thought it was important for her and the children to be totally secure while he, at the age of 44, would have to start all over again. He rented a bedsit, got back on his feet and eventually got a small flat in Bristol and remarried. His second wife gave up work when their first child was born. All the adults in that agreement had managed to handle questions of contact and finance in ways that any hon. Member would find commendable. No one could criticise the way they handled their financial responsibilities, nor could the open-door
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
policy towards the children be criticised. In fact, those children gained from the presence of mother, father and a very supportive stepmother.<br><br>
Then, along comes the Child Support Agency demanding truly unmanageable sums of money. It is not very nice to have people crying in one's surgery because of the situation that they are in. I went through a phase, before surgeries, of looking down the list of cases prepared by my staff. If the CSA featured on that list, I would routinely reach for a box of tissues. I knew that my constituents would need them, as I did too, sometimes.<br><br>
The case to which I referred had a very tragic outcome. Not long ago, the second wife came on her own to my advice surgery to tell me that the marriage had broken up. It had been a very happy marriage, but it ended because the legislation—which we were told would put children first—had destroyed all the family relationships.<br><br>
It is all very well having a family jurisdiction that is supposed to be responsible for sorting out all the financial consequences of a marriage breakdown, but section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 makes it clear that the interests of the child are the paramount consideration. The Minister knows that, having practised in that jurisdiction. But it is very difficult to decide what the bests of the children are. One may be able to decide where the children should live, if the man can afford to let the woman and the children to stay in the house and can pay the sum that the CSA wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point warrants underlining. The formula operated by the CSA, and that organisation's inabililty to see beyond accountancy returns, mean that no consideration is given to the necessity of creating two homes.<br><br>
Rents in my constituency are very much higher than in most other parts of London. I have come across more than one case in which the matrimonial home has been given to the wife and children, with the result that the father, because of the CSA, has had to move away from the area because he simply cannot afford local rents. Nor can he qualify for any local authority housing—even if my authority could provide such housing. So the connection between father and chilldren is, if not broken, simply eroded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a long intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just reaching my final point, Sir Patrick. It is also impossible for the father ever to entertain his children in his own home. They cannot stay with him overnight, because he simply does not have the space to put them up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right, although I disagree with her on one point: sometimes the relationship is destroyed, not eroded. In one case that I encountered, the wife of a man on a very low income went back to Norfolk with their daughter. My constituent could afford to have his daughter visit him only once a year. He would save up for her to come on a train: otherwise, his only contact was a telephone call once a week.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
When the CSA assessment form arrived and he saw how much he had to pay, he had to have his telephone disconnected, because he could not afford to pay the bills. So he could not even speak to his daughter any more—and such cases are not unusual. They happen every day and we are all responsible.</span></p>
