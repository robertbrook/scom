<p><i>Question proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government, who rightly want to tackle tax avoidance, will necessarily introduce complex legislation. It is important, however, that legislation dealing with a self-assessed tax is cast in simple terms that can be easily understood. It should also be targeted closely at the relevant abuse. The Bill, however, does not achieve either of those objectives.<br><br>
The drafting is extremely detailed and difficult for the taxpayer to follow. In view of the Bill's complexity, I question the ability of Customs and Excise officers consistently to interpret and apply it. That must surely be open to doubt, and I would welcome clarification from the Minister as to how standardisation of interpretation can be secured. In view of recent calls from Opposition and Conservative Members to simplify tax legislation, the provision is a retrograde step. Paragraph 1 (4) (c) of schedule 3 provides a good example of arcane drafting.<br><br>
Anti-avoidance legislation, as the Minister has recognised, requires balancing the needs of the Revenue with those of businesses in order to achieve a degree of certainty in the operation of the tax system. I am not sure that the clause will deliver that. It is wrong that a business man acting in accordance with the laws as interpreted by tax advisers should face the risk of customs rewriting the tax effect of a transaction up to six years later. That is especially worrying in the case of bona fide transactions.<br><br>
Parliament has a duty to thwart any attempt to enter a tax avoidance scheme, but the Bill must be properly targeted so that business men are aware that its provisions might be used to combat a specific transaction. The clause is like the proverbial sledge hammer used to crack a nut, or perhaps it is like a scatter gun, because it gives licence to Customs and Excise to injure and maim companies at will, if it chooses to do so. I recognise that the Minister says that that will not be the case, but we are likely to have new Ministers in future and new Customs and Excise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
staff who will make new interpretations. The provisions therefore need to be more clearly targeted.<br><br>
There is considerable confusion among businesses about the interpretation of the clause and, in particular, the Inland Revenue's application of it. It covers everyday transactions, which was perhaps not the original intention. The Minister said earlier that the main problem arose when companies entered or left group VAT operations. I appreciate that, but the Bill does not precisely target avoidance. Businesses will, therefore, be uncertain about which transactions the Customs and Excise will attack.<br><br>
Customs and Excise powers must be clarified, and I want to draw several issues to the Committee's attention. Some of them are detailed, and I hope that the Minister will respond to those that he can and consider others in more detail later.<br><br>
First, employee companies are affected by paragraph 1(1), 2(b) and 3 to schedule 3. Many companies—including those in the financial and public sector, such as insurance companies—operate with a trading company and a separate company that employs its personnel. They do that for sound commercial reasons. However, if companies were not VAT grouped the personnel company would have to charge the trading company VAT. The powers that clause 27 gives Customs and Excise could theoretically be used to disapply the VAT grouping, which would create a ridiculous scenario in which the trading company would have to employ its staff directly to avoid a VAT loss. We are in danger of enforcing a view of business organisation that favours divisional business structures, rather than group structures that involve different constituent companies.<br><br>
Secondly, paragraph 2(3) deals with the effects on a company's VAT recovery position. If the Customs and Excise issue a notice that requires a company to assume that it is or is not part of a group for one transaction or for a particular period, what action will the VAT group's representative member have to take to adjust the partial exemption calculations—the method of calculating recoverable VAT in past periods? As a joint chief executive of a formerly partially exempt VAT group, I appreciate that that could be a problem.<br><br>
The period during which a transaction occurs consists of several years prior to the issue of a notice of direction. Will all previous VAT returns be subject to recalculation and assessment? That needs to be clarified.<br><br>
Thirdly, paragraph 3(1) to the schedule deals with the consistency of the Customs' approach to issuing notices. Because the Customs and Excise can identify transactions within a six-year period, businesses will require clearances from it to be sure that transactions will not be challenged later. It is, however, always difficult to obtain such clearances in an appropriate commercial time frame. Furthermore, it will be difficult to ensure that VAT offices pursue a consistent approach. A complex conglomerate may, therefore,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
have to deal with several different VAT offices, each of which gives different information.<br><br>
Fourthly, paragraphs 1, 4, 4(b), 2(3) and 4(2) deal with the acquisition of a company. When a company purchases another company and joins another VAT group, can a notice of direction subsequently be issued, requiring a new company to be liable for the debts of the original group, which may be defunct? Organisations might change their practices if they are likely to be caught by Customs and Excise as a result of that acquisition transaction and buy only the assets of the company to minimise the risks of future liability.<br><br>
Fifthly, charges between existing groups relate to paragraphs 1(1); 1(2)(b) and 1(3) to the schedule. Where a taxable trading company has a partially exempt subsidiary within the VAT group, which from 29 November 1995 started to make a management charge between the companies, will the management charge be attacked as a tax advantage under the definition of a tax advantage given in paragraph 1(3)(c)? That brings me to my sixth point. Does that definition refer to an absolute VAT saving or simply to cash flow? Most companies legitimately experience cash flow advantages—that is a normal part of commercial trading—through VAT grouping. That also requires clarification.<br><br>
Seventhly, the definition of the term "full value" in paragraph 1(3)(c) is confusing. Tax advisers tell me that Customs and Excise will take it to mean VAT on the total consideration received whereas a business could easily take it to mean an attempt to impose a certain value on a supply. Could we have confirmation that Customs and Excise will take it to mean that and that that will appear in guidelines or a code of practice?<br><br>
My eighth point concerns the definition of a genuine commercial purpose in paragraph 1(a). That can often be difficult to identify as it relies on what was in the mind of the member of staff when a transaction was undertaken; there can be cases in which there are at least two interpretations of what was in the mind of a person or group of people in such circumstances. Ninthly, transactions undertaken before implementation of the legislation need clarifying—that relates to paragraph 1(3)(a) and paragraph 5(8). Will a company that commenced a chain of transactions before 29 November last year be caught by the legislation, which was not known to it at the time of its decision to proceed? Would it be fair to penalise a company in such circumstances? I do not think that it would and I would appreciate clarification on that.<br><br>
Tenthly—and lastly—I shall deal with transactions that have not yet taken place. It is difficult to perceive circumstances in which Customs and Excise could issue a notice of direction on a transaction that has not yet occurred but which is anticipated. Will the issuing of such a notice be withheld until the transaction has taken place or all the information has been disclosed to Customs and Excise? On the face of it, that would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
force the company to defend its actions in regard to transactions that had not even taken place.<br><br>
Those are just some of the areas that need clarification. There are significant problems with the legislation; it is too complex in general and, more importantly, is not simple enough for the ordinary taxpayer to understand. It takes a blunderbuss approach instead of targeting the particular avoidance. The Institute of Indirect Taxation states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the extent of the powers taken is awesome in its extent"</p></blockquote>
—that is not very good English but it is a valid point. The Institute of Taxation states:
<br><blockquote><p>"These provisions are likely to cause uncertainty at a time when simplification is being encouraged."</p></blockquote>
So two august tax bodies are suggesting that the Government may not have got it right. The sheer volume of Government amendments to schedule 3 makes it apparent that they had second thoughts as a result of the consultation exercise.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I accept that the Government could not put their proposals on avoidance out to consultation before the Budget because that would have encouraged companies to take advantage of those provisions before the Budget date. It seems obvious to me that the current system is unsatisfactory, because the length of time between Budget day on 29 November and this debate is so short. If the Government have in mind anti-tax avoidance legislation, prior to the Budget they should announce publicly what they want to achieve and state that any legislation they introduce will have retrospective effect from the date of that announcement so as to obviate any abuse in the meantime. I think that the taxpayer would consider such retrospection to be fair. It would be easily understandable and difficult for businesses to criticise. Will the Minister respond to that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) initiated this clause stand part debate this morning, he made some observations about the need to keep taxes low as a deterrent to avoidance. I agree with that sentiment. I think that high taxes are undesirable for a variety of reasons, which is why I belong to a party that believes in cutting and controlling taxes whenever possible. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's support for that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I am trying to respond to his initial point. I would like him to support us across the board, but he did not support our income tax cut in the Budget. Avoidance is also a problem for direct taxation, so his argument applies with equal force to the need to keep direct taxes down. If I have detected an inconsistency in his approach, he will forgive me for pointing it out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shortly after the Budget statement, I sought the Library's advice on the overall size of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
tax burden. I asked them to calculate for every year from 1979 onwards—since the Conservatives came to office—what proportion of our gross national product had been taken in taxation. They informed me—I was surprised to see that the Conservatives' record on tax is so bad—that in every year bar one, the proportion of Britain's GNP taken in taxation was higher than under the last Labour Government. It is no good the Minister claiming that his party is a party of low taxation.<br><br>
One must look at taxation across the board. In 15 of the past 16 years the overall burden of taxation under the Conservatives has been higher than it was under the last Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am little disappointed by the hon. Gentleman. I asked him why he did not support our Budget proposal to lower direct taxes and, to coin a phrase, he avoided the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I should like to press on. The simple and obvious fact is that the hon. Gentleman cannot pick and choose. If he really believes in reducing taxes—making avoidance less attractive is a welcome by-product of that—he should take every opportunity to do so. The fact is, we gave him one in the Budget but he did not take it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government pick and choose the taxes by which to measure their tax reduction. The standard rate of income tax has certainly been reduced by the Conservatives but that is the one and only tax that they pick to make their argument. I asked the Library to examine the overall tax burden—not to pick and choose.<br><br>
When one examines the Government's tax record and compares the reduction in the basic rate and higher rates of income tax under the Conservatives with the increase in other taxes on income—national insurance, the increases in taxes to local authorities, first with the introduction of the poll tax and then the council tax, and the more than doubling of the standard rate of VAT from 8 per cent. to 17.5 per cent.—it is clear that the tax burden under the Conservatives has been higher than under Labour for 15/16 of their time in office. I am not picking and choosing. Of course, I could make a powerful argument by sticking just to VAT.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must remember that his is an intervention and not another speech. Perhaps he will kindly conclude his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I simply make the point that I am not picking and choosing individual taxes, as the Minister seems to be doing. I have examined the Government's record by taking all taxation together and seeing what proportion of the national income is taken in tax. The information from the Library shows that in 15 out of the 16 years that the Conservatives have been in office, their overall tax take was higher than that in 1979 under a Labour Government.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the purposes of accuracy, I must say for the record that in 1979 the outgoing Labour Government left us with massive Government borrowing, which had built up because they were afraid to cover their expenditure honestly by means of taxation. It was inevitable, therefore, that to get on top of that huge inheritance of debt we had to put taxes up.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that he did not pick and choose, but I notice that he did not mention the 52 per cent. corporation tax rate that we inherited, or the national insurance surcharge, which took the tax on jobs up to 13½, per cent. We have now got that down to 10.2 per cent. and the Bill would reduce it to 10 per cent. I have not even started on income tax. Our record stands comparison with any that the hon. Gentleman can advance. However, I do not want to embarrass the hon. Gentleman by going into the actions of the last Labour Government. I should like to pick up on other points that were made about the need to counter tax avoidance.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) asked some considered and detailed questions. It is true that our tax system is complicated, and that avoidance schemes to get round that legislation are even more complex. I am afraid, therefore, that the anti-avoidance legislation is unavoidably detailed and complex. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point; that where possible, we must try to simplify. On the Customs and Excise side, we have a project called LEGIS by which we aim to simplify the customs statute across the board. I assure the hon. Gentleman that where possible we do what we can to simplify matters within the constraints placed upon us and in the face of considerable ingenuity by tax professionals and the commercial world.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dudley, West asked whether Customs and Excise would apply the latest measures fairly and consistently. I assure him that decisions on the directions will be taken centrally, for the first few years at any rate, for operating clause 27. That will ensure consistency of treatment in all VAT collections.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dudley, West also asked about charges between companies in an existing VAT group. I repeat that the clause and the associated schedule 3 do not amount to an attack on grouping. We are not keen to disturb what we acknowledge to be a useful and deregulatory measure commonly used in the commercial world, but want to target abuse of that useful grouping facility for tax avoidance purposes. The companies in the examples that the hon. Gentleman gave have nothing to fear unless they are engaged in avoidance and are using grouping for other than commercial purposes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a number of references to the clause. I was not quick enough to write them all down and find them in the Bill, especially as some references were to the Value Added Tax Act 1994, which I do not have in front of me. I shall endeavour
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0296">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
to write to the hon. Gentleman with the assurances that he seeks, but it is important that the clause is not regarded as adopting a scatter gun approach, as the hon. Gentleman implied. It is not a general anti-avoidance clause, but is targeted at the avoidance that takes place using grouping.<br><br>
I outlined this morning some of the significant safeguards built into the Bill. Indeed, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) and to the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo), I extended the safeguards as regards appeals so that the rights of innocent traders would be further protected.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dudley, West asked about pre-clearance and whether it would be possible for companies to clear transactions in advance. I can offer some help with that question. Customs will publish details of the terms under which its powers are to apply. That will be of practical assistance to grouped companies in anticipating whether Customs will take an interest in their affairs and categorise them as avoidance. However, I cannot promise that Customs in all circumstances will give pre-clearance. That would require detailed and lengthy investigation of all the facts, and would be expensive in terms of Customs and Excise resources and for the companies concerned. We cannot pre-clear on a hypothetical basis all prospective transactions, but the guidance issued by Customs will be effective.<br><br>
Although sections of the trade and the relevant professions have said publicly that they are alarmed at the wide discretionary powers that the clause appears to give to Customs, the reponse from most of the commercial world recognises that an abuse of the grouping provisions might put at risk the option to group. Indeed, many accountancy and advisory firms do not like transparent and obvious avoidance systems to be marketed. I say that not only because I am a member of one of the institutes but because I genuinely believe that the majority of the profession would prefer Parliament's wishes to be respected and grouping to be used only for the purposes for which it was established.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
In any case, the steps that we took last year to counter a specific, named avoidance which threatened revenue to a considerable extent, were based on a rather mechanical approach. It did not give customs the discretion that we want and it was criticised because it hit the innocent as well as the avoiders. It is generally accepted that the present powers are an advance on previous provisions which we are, of course, repealing. The powers, although discretionary, are tightly circumscribed. There is the option of an appeal in certain circumstances. I am satisfied that we have struck the right balance between the rights of trade and industry and the interests of the tax-paying public.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of the issues in the Government amendments were dealt with earlier, but, at the risk of repetition, I shall say that most of the amendments arise from the consultation exercise carried out when we could expose the draft legislation to the trade. The trade made several suggestions, some of them fairly technical, which we were able to accept.<br><br>
There is one more substantial amendment that deals with a loophole that we spotted which would have allowed a chain of two or more transfers of assets of a business as a going concern to get round the new provisions. As such transfers do not attract VAT, there would have been no input tax at all. As one of the main conditions for the exercise of the powers would not, therefore, be present, despite the same benefits to the avoider, it was necessary to introduce an amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 57, 58 and 59 deal with the issue of retrospection. We have heard in the debate that VAT avoidance is a matter of intrinsic difficulty, so producing a system to prevent avoidance is necessarily complex. The important issues are retrospection and the time period within which powers provided in the schedule will apply.<br><br>
Comments have been made to the Law Society, the Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Indirect Taxation. Provisions relating to retrospection are a matter of some concern. We need greater clarity from the Minister. Clause 27 and schedule 3 provide wide discretionary powers for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise—we keep being reassured that they will not necessarily be used—which seem capable of being used as a threat to trigger compliance.<br><br>
We accept that people need to be dissuaded from avoiding payment in the first place, but Parliament
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0298">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
must be careful in granting retrospective powers. The powers that are provided in paragraph 3(3)(b) of new schedule 9A may require assumptions to be made in relation to times falling before the occurrence of the relevant event. We discussed this morning what constitutes a relevant event.<br><br>
For example, if the commissioners direct that a company should be degrouped for VAT purposes—or included in a group for VAT purposes—prior to 29 November by referring to a transaction that took place subsequent to that date, then intra-group supplies made before 29 November could suffer the retrospective imposition of VAT as applied to supplies from outside the group, even though those supplies were made for bona fide commercial reasons. The question of retrospection is dealt with in volume 1, No. 21 of <i>Tolley's Practical Tax</i>—a publication read avidly by hon. Members—dated 5 November 1980. An article entitled "Government Policy" refers to a Mr. Peter Rees, who was Minister of State at the Treasury after the Conservatives took office in 1979. The article deals specifically with avoidance legislation, and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister confirmed that the Government has set its face against retrospective legislation".</p></blockquote>
I remind the Committee that we are talking about the financial sector. The article went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the rare circumstances under which retrospective legislation would be contemplated, there would be a Ministerial statement in the House of Commons and the subsequent provisions would he formally introduced in the next Finance Act and would have retrospective effect only to the date of that statement. Moreover, it is considered that in the past similar Ministerial statements may not have been sufficiently precise to give taxpayers and their advisers an accurate indication of what the new law is to be. Accordingly, it is hoped that any such future statement could be accompanied or followed by a draft clause, which would be the basis of consultation."</p></blockquote>
That statement does not discount the possible use of retrospection. It makes clear the procedures that are necessary when such important powers are invoked, and the likely impact on business. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) wrote about retrospective legislation in the July 1990 edition of <i>The Tax Journal.</i> He made some important general points about retrospective legislation, which he said offended against the rule of law and natural justice. He wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"The injustice is self-evident where <i>criminal</i> penalties are imposed as a consequence of acts … which were lawful at the material time but are later declared unlawful."</p></blockquote>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Moreover, the Rule of Law is meaningless if actions may retrospectively change their legal status".</p></blockquote>
That could be the consequence of giving wide-ranging powers and imposing such time limits as those in Schedule 3.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made it clear that
<br><blockquote><p>"statutes are open to different interpretations and their precise application to particular conduct may be in doubt"—</p></blockquote>
and therefore needs to be determined by a court. He said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Most people would readily reject retrospective application of criminal penalties. But in other areas—especially where losses to the Exchequer are involved—that principle of retrospection may be easily undermined."</p></blockquote>
We can breach that principle by giving wide-ranging powers.<br><br>
The article, which refers to the Finance Act 1989, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the 1989 Finance Bill debates … then Economic Secretary to the Treasury, adduced several reasons to justify retrospection. Firstly, the taxpayer who had challenged the Revenue".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Tatton gave other specific examples in addition to example of a windfall benefit. That contradicted the view expressed by Sir Geoffrey Howe when he was a Member of the House of Commons and the Conservatives were in Opposition—we could say that they say one thing and do another—who said on 12 July 1978:
<br><blockquote><p>"Of course it is possible to sympathise with the tax collectors and those who draft our laws. They will often seek to justify their case by showing a huge loss of revenue"—</p></blockquote>
the Paymaster General has today said that perhaps £600 million is at risk on top of the £400 million that has already been lost as a result of using VAT grouping in the first place—
<br><blockquote><p>"but I do not believe that the House regards this approach as justifiable."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 July 1978; Vol. 957, c. 1636.]</p></blockquote>
It was not a justification for retrospection.<br><br>
The debate on retrospection—under what circumstances should it be used and what powers should be given—is not particularly clear. While I do not want to go into party political differences, it is important that the Committee is clear about what powers of retrospection we are prepared to give. So as to provide certainty, amendment No. 57 would prevent the new law applying to transactions that took place before the 1995 Budget. Because of the way in which retrospection is currently phrased, it is conceivable that the Customs and Excise could go back to 1973 to seek out practices that, triggered by a relevant event, are now considered unacceptable in terms of clear avoidance strategies.<br><br>
If we do not introduce that notion of certainty, taxpayers will run the risk of pre-Budget transactions being overturned if Customs and Excise isolate a relevant event that occurred after 28 November.<br><br>
Under current law, a direction is not limited to transactions that occur as a result of a relevant event. Customs can extend a direction to any transaction or group structure of which it may have cause to disapprove. Retrospective taxation of transactions and events that occurred before the new measures were announced seems in principle to be unacceptable. Before the schedule is agreed to by the Committee, we need more assurances from the Paymaster General.<br><br>
Amendment No. 57 applies to the schedule's retrospective abilities, whereas amendments Nos. 58 and 59 are aimed at the future and the prospective way in which the six years could be used. Even if the Government agreed with us that the time period for retrospective application should be reduced—to the date of the Budget, we would need subsequent amendments with regard to the six-year period. Customs will still be able to make a direction that goes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0299">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
back to 29 November 1995 at any time in the future and will still have six years or more to discover the relevant event. That will certainly increase uncertainty and costs to business. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West said in the clause stand part debate, there needs to be some system of obtaining clearance from customs as well as more complex professional advice to ensure that actions are in order. That is especially true in the case of purchases of group companies, warranties and indemnities.<br><br>
It is unreasonable to expect businesses to retain indefinitely records and details of transactions to guard against the chance of a retrospective action. It seems like a hindsight clause. The Government are in effect saying that had such transacions been known about at the time, they would have been stopped, so in years to come when they are known to have been going on, there will be a power to go back and take action. Such a degree of potential retrospection seems unnecessary. Although we have been told that Customs and Excise will not necessarily always use its wide powers of direction, it should be able to deal with tax avoidance using the powers that it has already, without needing this substantial retrospective power. Therefore, before allowing any further degree of retrospection we should be given examples of the type of avoidance that the schedule would deal with and why the powers are necessary.<br><br>
There are good reasons for reducing the time limits within which Customs and Excise can make direction. Three years would be in line with existing retrospective powers in schedule 6(1) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. To limit the retrospective effect of such direction to the same period seems sensible.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 66 to 72 deal with innocent commercial transactions that are clearly not connected with tax avoidance. They ensure that a direction can be given for a transaction that involves tax avoidance only under paragraph 2(1)(a) of schedule 9A of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, which is inserted by schedule 3. That could easily be done, and a direction could be given only for the supply that is mentioned in paragraph 1(3). That would still allow a single direction to be given for a series of tax avoidance transactions.<br><br>
The amendments exclude from the Bill the power retrospectively to alter VAT group registrations. Innocent commercial transactions will almost always be caught by the new tax charge if that power is given. The power that article 4(4) of the European Community's sixth directive gives to treat two or more companies as a single taxable person is spent once it is exercised. No power exists to make a change retrospectively. If the Bill allows retrospective changes to be made to groups for periods before it was announced, it will prompt litigation. The European Court of Justice may be reluctant to permit the taxation of transactions that took place years ago, when there was no liability under existing law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was amazed that the hon. Member for Bristol, South referred to <i>Hansard</i> from July 1978. She conveniently forgot to mention the context of those debates. We had a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
Labour Government, and the top rate of tax was 98 per cent. on unearned income and 83 per cent. on earned income. The standard rate of income tax was 33 per cent., and the tax avoidance industry was in full flow. Huge revenue losses occurred, and the Government introduced the most outrageous retrospective legislation. In that context, the now Lord Rees introduced various principles—Sir Geoffrey Howe referred to them when he was shadow Chancellor—to establish a regime that prevented the introduction of retrospective legislation.<br><br>
It was established then that changes should never pre-date an announcement. If a serious problem arose, and customs or the Inland Revenue had to make a press release, it would be okay for the law to change on that date, but not prior to it. In the present case, the announcement was made on Budget day, which is why the Bill refers to 29 November 1995—that is the relevant date.<br><br>
Some people have queried whether the Bill will have the desired effect. The Institute of Taxation has argued that customs could go back to 1973 and unpick a VAT group. I am sure, however, that my hon. Friend can assure us about the intentions behind the Bill. It is surely not right to go back beyond the date on which an announcement was made.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South should remember what happened all those years ago under a Labour Government. We had high rates of tax and, as the hon. Member for York said, that leads to substantial tax avoidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a circular argument. He says that the tax avoidance industry under the previous Labour Government went into overdrive because of the higher rates of taxes on income. Given that the standard rate of VAT has more than doubled under the Conservatives, does he accept that that increase is partly why avoidance of VAT is a growth industry? Would not the same strictures that he says apply to taxes on income apply to VAT? What view does he have about the present standard rate of VAT? Would he like it to be reduced? Does he believe that a more than doubling of the VAT rate is a good thing and that the rate should remain as it is?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not think that one can compare that with confiscatory rates of tax on income of 83 per cent. and 98 per cent. The idea that somebody with an income of £100 should be left with £2 or £17 after the tax man has had his take is almost beyond belief—it is almost incredible now to remember that that is what the last Labour Government did. Our standard rate of VAT is now 17.5 per cent., which is comparable to standard rates of VAT through the European Union. The two issues are of a quite different order.<br><br>
Of course, if there is tax avoidance, we must counter it, but personally, I favour taxes on spending rather than on income so I support the shift since 1979 away from taxes on income towards taxes on spending. That is my short answer to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0300">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that when the standard rate of VAT was 8 per cent. it was too low and that it is now correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that I have supported the changes that have been made because I believe in taxing spending and, as far as possible, having lower taxes on income. That is of benefit to individuals, companies and the economy as a whole.<br><br>
On the specific issue, the relevant date in the legislation is 29 November 1995. If at all possible, we want an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister that the intention is to deal only with those schemes which are current after that date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to address amendments Nos. 79 and 80, tabled in my name, which also deal with the retrospective problem. They include the date of 29 November 1995 in the Bill. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that we need guidance on the intention of Customs and Excise on retrospection.<br><br>
To some extent, my hon. Friend the Paymaster General suggested that the intention is not to go back beyond 29 November except where schemes which started prior to that date are not yet complete. I suspect that that will be a satisfactory solution. However, we need clarity on that so that groups of companies have something to rely on when they make plans.<br><br>
As I understand it, there are essentially two reasons for not going beyond that date. The first was mentioned by the hon. Member for Bristol, South and deals with companies keeping records. Although there is a theoretical possibility that Customs and Excise may attempt to de-group VAT groupings of companies back to 1973, going back that far would pose fairly massive records-storage problems for companies. Given that companies were not paying or expecting to pay VAT on those transactions, it is highly unlikely that many will still possess the records in an accessible form, enabling them to go through the de-grouping for VAT purposes as required. It is unreasonable to expect companies to have kept records back to 1973 and I suspect that Customs and Excise do not intend that they should have done.<br><br>
In other words, I think that the Bill's provisions for retrospection are not likely to be utilised, but exist as belt and braces for Customs and Excise in case it feels that it needs such information in ill-defined circumstances. We need clarification on the subject and I look forward to my hon. Friend the Paymaster General assuring us that such clarification will be produced in the directions from Customs and Excise on the implications of the schedule.<br><br>
My other worry also involves retrospection but is less concerned with the specific date of 1973. It is the ability that Customs and Excise may have to use a company's minor infringement or inadvertent transgression—in terms of the total VAT potential liability of the group—in avoiding VAT as an attack
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
on the total VAT position of the group. That is a concern about scale and proportionality. Under the schedule, Customs and Excise could exercise such a power to recoup some of the VAT that is currently not paid because of the grouping provision—which, as my hon. Friend the Paymaster General said earlier, amounts to about £400 million.<br><br>
My amendments are probing amendments and I would be grateful to hear my hon. Friend's comments on the intentions of Customs and Excise and the clarity that will be provided in the form of regulations and directions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of the hon. Member for Fulham. One of the reasons that we tabled our amendments is that we feel it important to have clarity enshrined in law rather than merely receiving assurances. We seek to erect a backstop that will limit the retrospection of the legislation. The point made by the hon. Member for Fulham on proportionality is also important. We need clarification on that.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister did not have time to reply to my earlier point on the issuing of a Customs and Excise press notice last September announcing that the Government wanted to introduce VAT anti-avoidance legislation to catch certain categories of transaction and that the changes would have effect from this date rather than 29 November last year, so that a consultation exercise could begin before a Budget announcement. As it was accepted that we should have holding legislation last year, it is surprising that we had to wait until 29 November before the Government announced what the clause would do. Because of that omission we are not making good law; we have not given much time to consulting and involving those whom the Minister admits are alarmed at the wide nature of the provision. It should not be beyond the Government's scope to extend that process while maintaining clarity. I would welcome some comments on procedural matters so that we might make better law in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also agree with the hon. Member for Fulham. I have two questions, to which I hope that the Minister will respond at the end of the debate.<br><br>
First, the general principle is correct that tax avoidance, where that is the primary objective of companies when they decide to group together, should be sought out and put right. However, there is a difference between what big business does what small businesses do. Large corporations have the resources to maintain a department of tax specialists and are able to arrange their corporate structure in the most tax-efficient way. Small businesses do not have those resources. They know the business that they are in, but they do not know the business of tax planning.<br><br>
In the early to mid 1980s I ran a small to medium-sized television production company. I knew my product and my market, but tax planning was neither my field nor my interest. There were three parts to that company's corporate whole. We were grouped for VAT purposes because it would have been an even bigger nightmare for us, as a small firm, to account
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0301">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
three times over for our VAT transactions. It simply is not reasonable to expect small companies to keep tax records going back over a long period—it is hard enough to keep up to date with the tax records one needs for the current year. Would it be possible for the Bill to make some distinction between companies of different size, possibly related to turnover? That would provide some assurance that an unnecessary burden would not be placed on small businesses.<br><br>
My second question applies to larger businesses than to small ones. The clause's purpose is to seek redress for customs where a business or a group of businesses have established a corporate structure with the primary intention of reducing their tax liabilities. However, the Minister will acknowledge that sometimes a grouping arises out of a legitimate business purpose. For instance, a bank might group itself with a management services subsidiary that could provide consultancy work for the bank. Because of the grouping, the bank would not have to pay VAT on the subsidiary's invoice.<br><br>
Such an arrangement would be perfectly normal. It would not have been set up with the intention of minimising the group's tax liability. It would be wrong if the schedule's provisions were applied retrospectively to penalise a group that had entered into such an arrangement for a legitimate business purpose. How would customs distinguish objectively between a grouping that arises out of legitimate business purpose and one that arises primarily for the purpose of avoiding tax?</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The essence of schedule 3 and clause 27 is that customs—and, if necessary, the tribunal—distinguishes between commercial arrangements and tax avoidance. Customs will have no desire to disturb legitimate commercial arrangements. Indeed, the grouping provisions were designed to safeguard such arrangements. It is perfectly in order for a group of companies to register singly for accounting convenience and for VAT charges between them to be disregarded. That does not represent an avoidance scheme and would be undisturbed by the provisions—a point that I am pleased to repeat. Current grouping arrangements are satisfactory. We recognise that they provide some £400 million a year benefit for users. Provided that we can end abuses and stop avoidance schemes, we want the arrangements to continue.<br><br>
Avoidance has been used as a general term in our debate. My hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield and for Fulham have shown their understanding of the fact that we are not contemplating the sort of taxation retrospection that was probably being contemplated under the last Labour Government. Even if a scheme is nakedly and obviously tax avoidance, provided it was completed before 29 November last year, it will be entirely untouched by the Bill. In that respect, we do not intend to go back to the situation before Budget day.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
The retrospection that we are talking about relates to a scheme that might have been contemplated and put in place before Budget day but was not carried through to completion. If a relevant event—a term central to the clause—took place before Budget day, it would not trigger a tax direction. However, if the relevant event or operative part of the scheme fell after the announcement of 29 November, it would be vulnerable to direction by Customs and Excise. I ask the Committee to appreciate the important distinction that I have made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is crux of concerns over retrospection. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his clarification. Will he also confirm that Customs and Excise could also make the distinction clear in material sent to VAT-payers in order to make it less likely that a tribunal or the High Court would attempt to impose the provisions retrospectively or the High Court would attempt to impose the provisions retrospectively? As I read the Bill, it is capable of that interpretation in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will ensure that the situation is widely appreciated. My hon. Friend will understand why we tackled the problem as we did.<br><br>
I should like to answer one of the questions put by the hon. Member for Dudley, West. If we had not issued a press release making it clear that schemes completed after the stipulated date would be vulnerable, it would have invited forestalling. Giving notice to tax avoidance practitioners that they could happily set up, carry through and complete schemes between Budget day and the date of Royal Assent would have opened up a giant new vulnerability which would have run contrary to what we are trying to do. The following figures are rough, but, if there was no element of retrospection in the legislation, we could have lost between £200 million and £300 million—a large amount, even in the context of the overall Budget arithmetic.<br><br>
Almost by definition, transactions are complex and commercial. Typically, an avoidance scheme has several elements set out over a period of months. The crucial event is the relevant one—the operative part—and we will not go back before 29 November 1995 to attack schemes. That is an important assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's comment about not wanting to go back beyond 29 November 1995, but I still want to press him on his attempted answer to my query. I accept that 29 November 1995 will be the operative date for the legislation but why was the Budget date chosen to issue the notice instead of a previous date? There are examples in other pieces of legislation of a press notice announcing forthcoming changes which will take effect from the date of the notice. Why could not the date have been earlier, given that the anti-avoidance problem has been significant for a considerable time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman sat on last year's Finance Committee. He will recall that we dealt with a specific scheme and a new clause about anti-avoidance. At the time, I said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0302">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
that we would return to the question of grouping and, indeed, a more general consultation exercise is in place on grouping. It is not extraordinary that Budget day was the day on which we reached our conclusions about whether and how to counter such avoidance and decided to give a power to Customs and Excise to cover not just the exact type of avoidance dealt with last year, but other schemes using VAT grouping.<br><br>
The November date was convenient and, in practice, it has not created too many alarms because of the assurances that I have already given. The responsible end of the accountancy and financial advisory profession realised that something has to be done because, unchecked, previous practices would have been an abuse of the grouping provision as well as being unaffordable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a slight inconsistency in the Minister's comments. On the one hand, he says that the date must be 29 November—an extraordinary coincidence—because had he chosen a date after this Finance Bill has been enacted, about £300 million of funding could have been lost to the Exchequer; but he then claims that he has done nothing between last year's Finance Bill and 29 November, so that would not have cost an appreciable amount. I think that that was his phrase. There seems to be an inconsistency. Were not the Government negligent in not bringing forward proposals to deal with the tax-avoidance problem before Budget day?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that at some earlier date in the summer I should have announced that avoidance schemes would have to stop from a certain date, but I was not in a position to announce what sort of legislation I would be bringing forward and that would have created massive uncertainty.<br><br>
In the event, we were able to announce on 29 November that the Finance Bill would deal with the anti-avoidance problem in the way in which we knew it should and we said that we would shortly expose the draft legislation to the trade and the professions. Indeed, the fact that we managed to show the draft legislation to the trade has been appreciated. It may not always like what we have done and may have doubts and objections, certainly in matters of detail, but all those involved have appreciated that quite soon after our announcement we were able to take them into our confidence about how we intended to implement the scheme.<br><br>
My other point is that the amendments would have a number of unintended consequences. I am thinking in particular of amendments Nos. 71 and 72 but others have the same general effect—it appears that they would prevent a grouping or de-grouping before the date of a direction in all circumstances. That goes wider than the point about Budget day and before. It would forever shackle Customs and Excise when dealing with avoidance schemes.<br><br>
The example I gave this morning was of an entry scheme, where a company outside a group purchases
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
a computer and then joins the main group or transfers its business into the main group. Under the amendments, it would be impossible for Customs and Excise to counter that by grouping or degrouping. Although it could rely on attempting to tax subsequent payments between the customer within the group and the computer services, that could easily be circumvented by the simple expedient of making no further payments within the group for the computer services. Thus, the only way that customs could have countered that particular avoidance scheme would be rendered ineffectual. The efforts of the hon. Member for Bristol, South to counter by her amendments what she regards as unnecessarily wide powers would nullify or render at least partly ineffective the powers that members of the Committee as a whole feel are necessary to deal with clear avoidance schemes.<br><br>
Perhaps at this point I may respond to the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham about minor infringements being attacked. That is not the intention. We are concerned about situations where a scheme or arrangement is entered into and carried through without commercial justification and not in the normal course of business but in order to avoid tax. That is not the minor infringement that I think my hon. Friend has in mind. The example that he gave would not attract the attention of Customs and Excise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is reassuring. The concern is that an infringement—minor or otherwise—would be used then to attack the rest of the VAT grouping of the company even though the rest of the group would not necessarily be involved in the infringement. In other words, would it be the intention of Customs and Excise to attack only the artificial transaction and to recover the VAT that should have been paid on it plus any penalties, or would it intend to attack the whole VAT grouping for the company and therefore to recover much more VAT than should legitimately have been paid under the infringement or bogus transaction?</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure my hon. Friend that Customs and Excise measures—taxing supplies in the group or de-grouping—would be used only to recoup the tax that was avoided.<br><br>
My hon Friend's point brings us back to the theoretical prospect of returning to 1973 to effect changes to groups. That is conceivable only if specific avoidance schemes date from that year and are not normal commercial transactions. Even if it were necessary—in a case of which we are not yet aware—to return to 1973 to effect a de-grouping, we would not seek to recover tax in excess of what is necessary under the modern avoidance scheme. Customs do not, therefore, intend to use the grouping of de-grouping power to move against commercial arrangements that date from many years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Paymaster General's statement will help us considerably. The hon. Member for Dudley, West said that the Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0303">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
should be targeted more specifically—that is, of course, always desirable. One of the Bill's critics, the Institute of Taxation, said, however:
<br><blockquote><p>"it may not be possible to target the legislation more specifically".</p></blockquote>
It is, therefore, difficult to achieve the—can you help me with this word, Mr. Hill—specificity that we seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Butler <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend lunch today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I heard an extremely good speech by my right hon and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary at lunch today, but it was not on this subject, so I shall not dwell on it.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Dudley, West that we need legislation that is as specific as possible. If that is not possible, the next best thing is to have the best guidance. I hope, therefore, that Customs and Excise will publish full guidance notes that incorporate my hon. Friend's helpful advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General has gone some way towards dealing with our points about retrospection. Although we are happy to withdraw the amendments on that issue, we shall press amendment No. 66 to a vote. We sought the Paymaster General's assurance that innocent transactions would not be affected by the substantial powers in the Bill, but he has not given it.</span></p>

METHOD OF MAKING PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the object of the clause? It changes the payment on accounts scheme under which the monthly payments on account required from 2,300 traders who pay over £2 million VAT per annum will be reduced by half, and in return they will be required to make each payment by electronic means or credit transfer on the due date without the seven-day extension usually granted for such payment methods. The overall effect will be a net benefit of eight days cashflow on the total VAT bill.<br><br>
The reductions in the amount will be made by a statutory instrument, as will the option for traders to make payments on account based on actual liability each month. It is not known when the statutory instrument will be available. However, under VAT regulations, customs is required also to notify each business individually of the changes in the amount it pays and the times for payment.<br><br>
The changes will take effect from 1 June 1996. Customs has stated orally that the new regime will apply to payments due for the month of June onwards. So any payment for May will be under the old rules and for the old amount, even though it may not be due until 7 July. However, it appears that payments in respect of May can be subject to the new default surcharge regime. Clause 30 inserts section 28(2)(a) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, allowing customs to give directions as to how payments on account must be made. Customs will contact payment-on-account traders who do not use electronic means at present to advise them on the options available.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that, if payments are required to be made by electronic means, the taxpayer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
will retain control—in other words, that the direct debit method will not be used? I hope that the Paymaster General will be a little more forthcoming about how the provision will affect those 2,300 traders.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The change in the payment-on-account scheme should be considered as a package. It removes the concession on the seven-day extension to the due date for payment by credit transfer, but that is balanced by a reduction in the amount of the payment on account required. That amount will be reduced by 50 per cent., from 1/12th of the annual liability to 1/24th. Although those large traders will have to pay the money without the seven-day extension, the amounts that they will pay on account will be reduced. That will balance the cash flow loss.<br><br>
As for the requirement to pay by electronic means, three quarters of those large businesses already pay by such means. That represents 95 per cent. by value of the total paid. I assure the Committee that there will be no requirement to use direct debit. The requirement is only for payment by electronic means: I assure the Committee that the provision will not be more prescriptive than that.</span></p>

VAT INVOICES AND ACCOUNTING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a query about the clause's provision that allows customs to relax the regulatory requirements for a VAT invoice. The amendment to the VAT regulations again will be made by statutory instrument after the Bill has received Royal Assent. That will allow businesses to seek simplification of VAT invoices in certain cases, such as purchasing cards that replace normal VAT invoices.<br><br>
The clause also allows customs to make regulations to require the issue of "a document"—a credit note or a debit note—when making a "financial adjustment", and to specify its contents. Budget News release Customs and Excise No. 11 indicated that the clause is aimed at changes in price which alter the VAT payable, thus ensuring that customers as well as suppliers adjust their VAT. The regulation will be made in the summer of 1996, following a consultation process that began in October 1995.<br><br>
It is unclear whether the new measures will apply in cases in which the adjustment is "VAT only"—that is, to charge VAT originally omitted, or refund VAT
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0305">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
incorrectly charged. I hope that the Paymaster General will clarify that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give that assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am contemplating tabling a new clause, but it occurs to me that clause 34 may cover the matter that worries me—the liability to pay VAT on computer equipment for registered disabled people. Some time ago a blind constituent of mine acquired a computer system which allows him to read and respond to written documents. A scanner takes in the text, which is rendered by the computer into speech by means of a speech synthesiser. My constituent is able to type a reply and check it by means of Braille script that the computer can print out. Finally, he can print out a typed version which he can send to his correspondent.<br><br>
The equipment was supplied by a Worcester-based company called Dolphin systems. When my constituent bought it he was told that VAT was not payable as the system was designed especially for disabled people. The company states that it was advised by its local tax office in 1988 that systems of that type could be supplied without incurring VAT, but it now tells me that Customs and Excise is reconsidering the matter. It appears that instructions are about to be issued that VAT should be charged on the printer producing text in ordinary type rather than in Braille, and on the computer system, whose ordinary components could be used by able-bodied people. The company says that components such as the speech synthesiser, the scanner and the Braille printer, which are specially designed for disabled people, would not attract VAT.<br><br>
That decision seems perverse. The system is designed as a whole; neither the scanner nor the speech synthesiser would have value or purpose without a computer—they would be meaningless electronic junk. They assist a blind person only if they are connected to a personal computer and a printer.<br><br>
Customs and Excise seems to be splitting hairs. The best parallel that has occurred to me is with a paraplegic who buys a bath hoist to enable him or her to get in and out of a bath. No VAT is paid on that because it is an aid for the disabled. Following the logic used by customs, it would be possible to argue that the castors on the bottom of the hoist could be taken off and used by a carpenter for another piece of furniture and that the seat on the hoist could be taken off and used by an able-bodied person. Customs and Excise has not made such a ruling. Whereas the computer system could be taken apart and parts of it used by able-bodied people, it is designed and supplied as a whole to provide a useful aid to a disabled person.<br><br>
I considered tabling a new clause to provide the clarification that I seek on behalf of my constituents. However, the discretion allowed in subsection (2) would allow Customs and Excise to rule that a computer system for the blind should not, as a whole, incur VAT. If the Minister gave me that assurance now, or shortly in writing, I would not proceed with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
the new clause. The matter came to my attention only recently—I wrote to the Minister about it on Friday and I do not expect that he has seen that letter or considered the issue yet but I mention it to put it on the record. I hope that if the Minister responds in writing he will do so quickly enough to enable me to table a new clause, if that seems the best way to resolve the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to pick up on the comments of the Institute of Indirect Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants on the clause. They say that a VAT invoice should bear an ascription declaring, "This is a VAT invoice" or something to that effect. What did the Minister make of those comments and does he intend to do anything about them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am familiar in general terms with the computer equipment case. The hon. Gentleman is aware of VAT law: VAT is not charged on what might be called disabled specific equipment, but is charged on generic equipment. The firm that he mentioned, Dolphin, has corresponded with us and several hon. Members have also written to me. The best thing that I can do is to write to the hon. Gentleman, perhaps in the light of his comments today. However, I can offer no prospect of widening what Parliament has decided should be zero-rated. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should table a new clause because under the present legislation, Customs and Excise interprets the VAT status of the equipment correctly.</span></p>

LIABILITY TO PAY TAX</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 24, line 40, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) A landfill site operator shall not be liable to pay landfill tax, and shall not charge tax on any disposal, if he is not a taxable person for the purposes of the Value Added Tax Act 1994.".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Paymaster General will accept this simple amendment which is designed to deal with liability to pay landfill tax. It would ensure that landfill operators too small to register for VAT would also be exempt from landfill tax. It makes sense to align the new landfill tax with VAT. The Government have lifted their wording straight from the Value Added Tax Act 1994 so they clearly recognise the connection.<br><br>
If a company is so small that registering for VAT would place impossible compliance costs upon it, it is reasonable to assume that payment of landfill tax would present similar problems. The Government have claimed for some time that they support small
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0306">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
businesses. The amendment would tidy up the provisions and help small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Hill, the clause states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The person liable to pay tax charged on a taxable disposal is the landfill site operator."</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if my hon. Friend the Paymaster General, in replying to the hon. Member for Bristol, South, explained how many landfill site operators he expects to be registered. Vast numbers are registered for VAT. The registration threshold benefits some small businesses, which do not have to register. Will not far fewer landfill site operators be registered? It is surely difficult for small businesses to operate landfill sites, so how many does my hon. Friend anticipate will register?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In answer to my hon. Friend, there are about 1,400 site operators who should register for landfill tax as compared with 1.5 million companies or partnerships registered for VAT. My hon. Friend is right: in practice, few operators will be small enough to avoid having to register. However, it is undesirable in principle to grant a concession because it might induce disaggregation. In any case, it would be resented if small local operators had the advantage of being exempt not only from VAT but from landfill tax. Whether a site is registered for VAT has nothing to do with whether it is environmentally well run or whether it is a suitable place for landfill. On grounds of fair competition and possible distortion, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It had not occurred to me that there would be disaggregation to avoid paying the tax. Is the Minister saying that because landfill is an environmental tax, compliance costs to small businesses should be ignored? If so, he is making a clear statement that this provision is a direct environmental tax. We shall return to the issue later. At this stage, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is concern that the liability for the tax falls on individuals in an incorporated entity, not on the entity itself. The tax could, thus, pass through the shield of incorporation to the company's individual directors. Will my hon. Friend clarify his intentions towards the personal liability of directors who operate landfill sites?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South spoke about landfill tax, and the clause raises questions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
about its role as an environmental tax. I would, therefore, be grateful for clarification on the issue.<br><br>
Landfill site operators in some industries recycle waste that would otherwise be placed in landfills. The success of the landfill tax as a real environmental tax will depend on who is liable to pay the tax and on the costs that are imposed on an industry. What information does the Minister have from different industrial groups on those costs?<br><br>
A few years ago, the Select Committee on the Environment considered an inquiry into recycling. The Department of the Environment commissioned a report from Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte in 1993, which estimated that
<br><blockquote><p>"the costs of sending waste for landfill could rise by between 37 per cent. and 135 per cent. by the year 2000."</p></blockquote>
That did not include a landfill tax. Clearly, such costs could have a significant impact on several industries. Indeed, many of them—salt, sugar, steel, coal, sand—have sent us notes about their concerns as to whether the costs will penalise them because they operate landfill sites and are operational companies in their own right. I know that amendments relevant to that have been tabled to later clauses, but will the Minister clarify the matter now before we go further into detailed consideration of the different industries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say what thought has been given to the enforcement of the proposed tax? We are talking about one of the most dergulated industries and it is extremely difficult to know what is happening on some sites for the purposes of environmental control, never mind tax control.<br><br>
When the Select Committee on the Environment envisaged a landfill levy, one of the resulting benefits that it foresaw was the industry being brought under some kind of regulation. That could lead to an improvement in people's bad experience of landfill site operators. If that is to be so, and liability is to be enforced on the individual operator, as set out in the clause, considerable thought needs to be given to the consequences of totally unregistered landfill sites, how they could be controlled and how their spread could be prevented. Will the Minister give us an update on the current situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures that my hon. Friend gave earlier regarding the number of site operators were significant. The fact that 1.5 million traders are registered for VAT but only 1,400 traders are registered for the landfill tax illustrates the point of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth).<br><br>
If only 1,400 landfill traders are registered, it should be relatively easy for Customs and Excise—if one compares the number of traders with all the companies that are liable to pay VAT—to keep a firm grip on what goes on. It will be important to check all

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
the sites properly. If only 1,400 people are to supply the prospective revenue of £450 million, each one will yield, on average, £300,000 in tax—not in turnover. that indicates that the businesses are all fairly substantial; by definition, one cannot operate a small business in landfill.<br><br>
I share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham about the suggestion that in certain circumstances directors might be personally liable for the tax. That issue is raised in schedule 4. I have tabled an amendment to that which I hope you might be good enough to select on Thursday, Mr. Hill and which we will then be able to disscuss. It is an extremely important issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was talking to a fireman at the weekend who was telling me his views on the landfill tax. Like several of his colleagues, he owns a business in addition to his community reponsibilities as a fireman. His business involves landscape gardening and he is fairly streetwise about what goes on in terms of the collection and disposal of lots of rubbish.<br><br>
He said that a number of people in his line of work have smallholdings that they are using increasingly as, dare I say it, landfill sites. They hold waste on those sites for a substantial period before they then collect some or all of it and dispose of it in a registered landfill site. Increasingly, that fireman and some people with smaller businesses are taking their waste to those smallholders who act as intermediaries between them and the registered landfill sites. Will the Minister tell us about the growth of that practice and what we can do to prevent it? Large proportions of agricultural countryside and smallholdings could he used as waste dumps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Fulham and for Beaconsfield raised the question of directors' personal liability. We shall get to that later in our proceedings. I, too, am a little worried about any departure from the usual practice of going after the company or corporation when a debt arises. We should go behind the well-known veil of corporation only in exceptional circumstances. There is a precedent for that in the betting and gaming field. If it disturbs the Committee—my two hon. Friends in particular—I will favourably consider an amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield mentioned that he has already tabled such an amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) asked whether this was an environmental tax. Yes, it is, because it gives the right incentives not to landfill as a first resort. Landfill should be a last resort: waste producers should look for alternative ways of dealing with their waste, such as recycling. By taxing landfill, we encourage recycling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The steel industry, especially the engineering side, is a 100 per cent. recycling
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
industry. It constructs its products by recycling steel scrap. It is, therefore, highly environmentally conscious and disposes of its waste materials in the best way possible.<br><br>
The steel industry owns large tracts of land which it has to reclaim. As things stand, it will be liable to pay tax on the landfilling it does as part of its reclamation work. Such land reclamation is beneficial for the regeneration of the city: it has environmental benefits and, if it is done correctly, we might even get housing back on some of those areas. The steel industry is an environmentally friendly, recycling industry, so it fulfils two roles. It makes many representations to us—particularly to those of us with large steel plants in our constituencies. It believes that this tax, far from encouraging new technology and new developments to make it an even more environmentally friendly industry, will penalise the industry by imposing a cost of 35p a tonne. I referred to that on Second Reading, as the Minister will recall. This tax will not be environmentally friendly unless some of those contradictions are sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the longest intervention that we have had in our proceedings. We shall doubtless return to the issue of industrial costs, but I remind the hon. Lady that industry will benefit from the mirror cut in national insurance contributions; many businesses can also minimise the waste they produce or find disposal methods other than landfill. The advantage of the tax is that it will be paid by site operators and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, it will therefore be levied on only 1,400 companies but it will be passed on to waste producers. It encourages those producers to find, where possible, alternative waste methods: reducing the quantity of waste, recycling, composting, incineration, and so on. We shall come to the details of those methods, particularly the case for exemptions—which is what I think the hon. Member for Hillsborough wanted to know about.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East is right to say that enforcement is vital. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 and subsequent regulations impose a duty of care on those dealing with waste and require carriers to be registered. The sites that will be taxed are already identified and registered under environmental legislation; so we are superimposing a tax regime on an existing structure of regulations to deal responsibly with waste streams. I assure the hon. Gentleman that Customs and Excise will work with the enforcement agency—the Environment Agency—on unregistered, informal sites to ensure that such activities as fly tipping are dealt with appropriately. That also covers the point about smallholdings made by the hon. Member for Dudley, West. Some allotments in my constituency look like landfill sites, but their proud owners tell me that they contain spring vegetables and that the rotting car frames are actually greenhouses; so one must be careful about mentioning that. If the tax leads to the wrong sort of behaviour and to the springing up of unregulated sites, that will attract the attention of Customs and Excise, in parallel

<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that 1,400 companies were liable to pay the tax and that £450 million would be collected. The hon.
