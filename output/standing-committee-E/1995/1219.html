<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Health Service Commissioners (Amendment) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome members of the Committee to the first sitting on the Health Service Commissioners (Amendment) Bill. I know that I speak on behalf of my co-Chairman, Mr. Donald Anderson, when I wish you a restful break when the House rises for the short Christmas recess. We look forward to you returning with your batteries fully charged for the Committee's remaining sittings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Horam)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Health Service Commissioners (Amendment) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesday 9 January at half-past Four o'clock and, with effect from Thursday 11 January, on Thursdays and Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Winterton—at least it is now, and I hope that it will remain so. You are extremely experienced in health matters, and this is a health Bill. The fact that you are chairing the Committee demonstrates the Bill's importance to patients, their relatives and to NHS practitioners and staff. You will be able more readily to separate the wheat from the chaff because of your background in health. We also welcome Mr. Anderson.<br><br>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee made it clear on Second Reading that they supported the Bill's aims and that they expected constructive debate and scrutiny. I am sure, therefore, that both Chairmen will have an instructive and interesting time. I shall listen carefully to hon. Members' views and I hope that we shall be able to reassure them on the issues that were raised on Second Reading.<br><br>
The sittings motion may seem overambitious—as does this Room, given that this is a tiny Bill. We adopted the present sittings motion not only so that we might have a good recess, but so that we could proceed speedily on a Bill that is widely desired. It will reform the national health service complaints system and implement widely welcomed proposals to extend health commissioners' jurisdiction to cover all complaints about services to NHS patients, wherever they are provided.<br><br>
I hope that we shall make sufficient progress so that we do not have to use all the sittings that are provided for in the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Health Service Commissioners (Amendment) Bill the Committee do meet on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Tuesday 9 January at half-past Four o'clock and, with effect from Thursday 11 January, on Thursdays and Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the order of consideration motion, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room.<br><br>
I should also call attention to the fact that adequate notice and, whenever possible more than the minimum notice period, should be given of amendments. As a general rule, Mr. Anderson and I will be extremely reluctant to call starred amendments.</span></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses I to 3, Schedule 1, Clauses 6 and 7, Clauses 4 and 5, Clause 9, Clause 8, Clauses 10 to 13, Schedule 2, Clauses 14 to 16, new Clauses and new Schedules.—[<i>Mr. Horam.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

PROVIDERS TO BE SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I offer you, Mr. Winterton, and you Mr. Anderson, our good wishes for the festive season. I hope that we can stick strictly to the timetable that we agreed and that the Bill will move on to Report not too long after the festive season. In the Committee, we intend to cooperate as much as is possible and practicable on the substance of the Bill. As we pointed out on Second Reading, however, it is an ambitious timetable for the Bill to become law before 1 April 1996. We wish to avoid passing an incoherent Bill with insufficient mechanisms to implement it. Nor do we want to create a role for the commissioner—to consider complaints at the end of a two-stage procedure—if the system is not properly in place or is ineffective.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain how the timetable will work in practice? What safeguards does he have in mind to ensure that the commissioner's new remit meshes with the rest of the complaints procedure? We welcome the proposals to extend the commissioner's remit to cover family health service providers—those in the independent sector who treat national health service patients—and their staff.<br><br>
I am sure that we all agree that this reform of the complaints procedure is long overdue. However, I am worried about certain aspects of the extension of the health service commissioner's remit. First, his new remit extends to family health service providers, from dentists and pharmacists to general practitioners, both fundholding and non-fundholding. Will the Minister tell us whether all those providers will operate the full new NHS complaints system, which is the cornerstone of the commissioner's new powers? If they are all running a complaints procedure, will they have time to administer to their patients, which is what they are mainly there to do? Has the Minister's Department undertaken an analysis of how much time family
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
health service providers should spend on the new complaints and ombudsman system?<br><br>
What will be the financial consequences of the extension of the health service commissioner's remit? We understand that it will cause marginal additional financial cost to the NHS. Has the Department carried out research on this matter? Costs might be marginal to the NHS as a whole—I would welcome any evidence for that assumption—but what effect will the new role have on small pharmacists, general practices or dentists still working within the NHS? A marginal cost to the service as a whole could be a real burden on an individual practice.<br><br>
What of independent providers? The Bill makes it clear that those contracted to treat NHS patients will be liable to the same new complaints and ombudsman system as NHS providers. We welcome that, but how will it work? That is the question that many people, both inside and outside the House, want answered. Are independent providers to run complaints systems, and to be subject to referral to and investigation by the health service commissioner, only for some of their patients, as the Bill directs? Can such a system, with independent providers examining just one category of patients, be made to work?<br><br>
What will happen if, as is inevitable, a private patient with the same grievance of injustice or hardship as a national health service patient in the next bed writes to complain that he has no method of complaining about the decisions made by the private provider? As Members of Parliament, we could all encounter that problem. Under the legislation, private patients have no recourse because they are totally private, but national health service patients in the same establishment have the right to complain to the ombudsman about their treatment. What will the Minister reply when the commissioner writes that he has investigated case A—a patient whom he can investigate—but that patient B, who has an identical complaint, cannot be investigated because he is excluded by the Bill?<br><br>
What are independent providers supposed to do if the commissioner makes recommendations? Should they implement the procedures on behalf of some of their patients, or for all of them? Could national health service patients in the independent sector become more of a burden, as it were, than private patients because of the complaints procedure? That relevant question should be asked at the outset because the legislation affects the independent sector. The problem is that the extension of the remit reaches only halfway inside the independent sector.<br><br>
What incentive is there for the independent sector fully to comply with the two-stage complaints procedure that will exist in the national health service? Many people want to know whether stages 1 and 2 will exist in the independent sector—will individual patients be able to receive such a service?<br><br>
The statutory framework for compliance by independent providers is missing from the legislation. To some extent I understand why, if there has been maladministration or clinical misjudgment, national health service patients can involve the commissioner
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
in the independent sector. But will stages 1 and 2 be written in?<br><br>
Can the Minister explain how the Bill holds together? There seem to be inconsistencies and discrepancies, which should be addressed if we are to produce a workable and coherent legal framework for the new powers of the commissioner.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will consider my comnments constructively. The solution to the problems raised by my questions will ensure a better procedure for patients accessing the system for the first time to have their complaints heard and dealt with. The inclusion of the independent sector, as welcome as it is, introduces many questions about how private patients are to be treated. Opposition Members want those questions answered. What happens if there are great contradictions between national health service patients and private or independent patients in the same establishments? It is beholden on us all to try to get answers to those fundamental questions, as clause 1 breaks new ground, which we all welcome—it provides cover for our constituents when they are in the care of independent providers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, I must point out that I intentionally allowed the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) to go rather wide. The clause relates specifically to providers, but because it is an important clause and I felt it important that the Committee should have a good start, I allowed a certain discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. In common with other colleagues, I hope that between now and our next sitting we shall have a good, jolly and restful time.<br><br>
I will not repeat any of the points made by the hon. Member for Rother Valley, but want to add two questions. First, will the Minister tell us where there is a definition, or give us one, if there is not one in the Bill, of the four categories in new clause 2A? He might promise, understandably, to give us one next time rather than today. They are general medical services, general dental services, general ophthalmic services and pharmaceutical services, which are the same categories as apply to England, Scotland and Wales in the proposed insertion into the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993.<br><br>
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, will the Minister give details about the people who will be subject to investigation as set out in the proposed new section 2B? For example, someone who provides services under an arrangement with a health service body or family health service providers could do that part time or full time; they could even do it once only. Independent contractors, who were mentioned earlier, might include all sorts of categories. Someone might, for example, be referred to an osteopath, a homeopath or another practitioner who is around the periphery of the health service. Those are additional services that cannot be provided by one of the core participants.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
10.45 am<br><br>
I suggest to the Minister that one of the best ways of achieving a workable, user-friendly system is to provide a list of those professions, occupations or qualifications that practitioners will be using and which bring them within the new clause. There is controversy in the House, for example, and early-day motions have been tabled for the setting up of a registration procedure for psychologists. A couple of years ago, we enacted a Bill to ensure that chiropractors were included within a registration system. All sorts of people do what they regard as professional jobs, but they are not necessarily registered and accepted. It would be helpful for people to know in advance whether they can make a complaint against a practitioner if something goes wrong. Grey areas should be avoided if at all possible.<br><br>
Finally, to follow and reinforce a point that was made earlier, it would be helpful to know whether everyone will be subject to the same procedures. If people are to understand the system, we need to know whether everyone who falls within the definition will be subject to a three-stage procedure, or whether there are any exceptions or alterations.<br><br>
I support clause 1, which opens the ambit of the legislation as we discussed on Second Reading. We need some definitions, however, and I hope that, by the end of the Committee stage or on Report, the Minister will have given a definition, that the punters will be able to use of the people about whom we are talking. That would make the Bill and the procedures that will follow it much more useable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill, whose subject matter I have discussed over a number of years. I am not sure, however, that it goes as far as I want. Does my hon. Friend the Minister anticipate that someone who is unfortunate enough to come out of hospital in a worse state than that in which they went in—due to accident or error—would be helped by the ombudsman's decision to take the necessary legal action? Many of my constituents and many people throughout the country cannot afford the legal procedures that would give them the redress that they seek.<br><br>
I should also like to reiterate some of the comments of the hon. Member for Rother Valley. Why cannot the Bill be extended to the whole of the private sector, instead of being limited to national health service patients? I am sure that the Minister realises that even private patients sometimes come out of hospital worse than when they went in. Some even die.<br><br>
I welcome the fact that the Bill also covers dentists. People can be very ill after dental treatment that has not been carried out properly. As I know only too well, they can end up in hospital after treatment that was less efficient than it might have been. The Bill should also include people who have been private dental patients.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
No doubt my hon. Friend the Minister will recall a well-publicised case a couple of years ago, in which a private patient died after keyhole surgery. Her husband, who is now also dead, spent nearly all his money trying to ensure that no one else would suffer as his wife and his family did. So it is important that we consider carefully whether the Bill should cover independent providers of health.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I add my congratulations to those that have already been paid to you as Chairman of this Committee.<br><br>
Clause 1, which deals with persons subject to investigation, is inadequate in that the definition of who is covered does not include health service managers. The main purpose of the Bill is to include clinical decisions within the ombudsman's remit. That is a significant advance. I have never understood why such decisions were not included before. The change is excellent. It will greatly help the complaints procedure and so will obviate the need for a lot of legal work. Many people who complain resort to the law, either because they think that there has been a cover-up, or because they do not get an answer. The Bill will satisfy such people, and is therefore an important addition to the complaints procedure. It is important too in that it will flush out some people whose clinical judgment is not up to standard. It is right that they should be flushed out early on and in that way the Bill will improve medicine.<br><br>
Many people, including managers, however, are now involved in clinical judgments. I tabled an amendment, which has rightly been rejected because it was inadequate, but it concerns a matter that I intend to raise again later, possibly in a new clause. The question is: what happens when a doctor wants to administer a treatment of proven value, which the local hospital manager refuses to sanction for financial reasons? Will the Bill allow the ombudsman to challenge the manager's judgment? I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to that question, as it will determine how I act in the future.<br><br>
The situation described in my question certainly happens in connection with certain clinical cases. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley has tabled amendments in relation to purchasing, and we will be able to discuss, and possibly challenge, the wider implications of purchasing procedure on clinical matters later. However, there is no point in challenging a clinical decision if managers cannot be challenged also about decisions not to provide funds for necessary and proven treatments. I am not talking about rationing—the Minister will be relieved to hear—nor about decisions relating to treatments whose value is less certain. I am talking only about the administration of funds for treatments of proven value.<br><br>
I wish to make two last, brief points about the Bill. One important question concerns who will make the decisions about clinical decisions, and I hope that the Committee will be able to explore that matter later in our proceedings. Finally, the hon. Member for Batley
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0720">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) referred to the Bill's relationship to other matters. Complaints can be pursued in various ways: through the complaints procedure, the pinnacle of which is the ombudsman, through legal cases of negligence, which are separate but related, and through the General Medical Council, which considers serious professional misconduct and professional performance. We will have to explore that whole area later and I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising the subject. Perhaps the Minister will give me his thoughts on the points that I and others involved in clinical decisions have raised, so that I can frame my response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to continue the train of thought begun by the hon. Member for Batley and Spen—when my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has recovered from his sneezing fit.<br><br>
Why have the Government taken the view implicit in the Bill—welcome though this measure is in many respects—that the private sector, when dealing solely with private patients, does not require a system of complaint and redress? The clause very properly and desirably deals with the hybrid area in which NHS patients are treated by independent providers. That is wholly welcome. In life, people engage in a variety of relationships. They may deal only with the NHS, or they may occasionally deal with independent providers through the NHS, both of which are taken care of by the clause, but in another part of life they may see independent providers as independent patients. That reflects the mixture of people's experiences.<br><br>
The Government are keen to develop the private sector, but we have this oddity. Although the Bill properly extends protection to the hybrid area, it does not provide protection for private patients. A variety of ombudsman schemes have been established—including those established by the Government. Some are entirely voluntary, some entirely statutory and some are hybrids—that is, they have a statutory basis, but are run by voluntary organisations. The private sector provides a variety of pension schemes and insurance, banking, building society and legal services. The Government have thought it right to ensure that schemes for complaint and redress are put in place for those services.<br><br>
Why, in this case, do the Government think that private patients can play the market and take it as it comes? Yes, there may be recourse to the courts for medical negligence. Yes, the regulatory bodies may intervene, if that is appropriate. But why should private medicine not have a similar system of complaint and redress to that offered—and now being extended—to NHS patients? Will the Minister reflect on that and say something about it when he replies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I join other hon. Members in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton? It is always a pleasure to have another hon. Member from Cheshire in the Chair.<br><br>
I still fail to understand the definitions in the Bill, despite my exchange with the Minister on Second
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Reading. I want to follow the theme that I adopted then, using the example of dentistry. I fail to see how the Government intend to draw a distinction between NHS and private dental provision. The hon. Member for Batley and Spen made an important point about that.<br><br>
On Second Reading, I cited the example of practices that are now wholly owned by companies such as Denplan. One can have purely NHS dental treatment in a hospital or dental practice or NHS treatment, perhaps with some medical insurance, through an organisation such as Denplan. There are also practices that are wholly owned by Denplan, but which provide limited NHS services. At the other end of the spectrum are practices that are totally private providers. As the Bill stands, the Government will be unable neatly to define which practices will be included or excluded. Will the Minister explain how such definitions will be drawn up and, given the comments of the hon. Member for Batley and Spen, why they need to be? There is no logic in such an approach.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden spoke about the confusion that will emerge over management and clinical functions. I received a letter this morning from the chairman of the Countess of Chester hospital trust. He expresses serious concern about a creeping backlog in hospital maintenance. If something goes wrong as a result of the management's failure to address a maintenance issue—the letter blames such cases on the Secretary of State—such issues might not be subject to complaint, even though they affect clinicians' ability to undertake their work. A clinician might rightly insist that particular action is undertaken, but it might be impossible to do so because of a failure in the maintenance programme. The letter says that such a situation arose in the trust a few months ago. Will a patient in that situation simply receive an apology from the hospital because equipment because equipment was not on hand or will the matter be subject to the complaints procedure? If so, will it be the fault of the clinician or the management? How will such distinctions be drawn?<br><br>
We should accept that some distinctions need to be drawn now and that definitions need tightening up. That would help us later in our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the remarks that have been made about your good self, Mr. Winterton.<br><br>
It is worth examining the comments of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) about the accountability of the managers and directors of health service providers and about whether they will be subject to investigation by the commissioner. The case of child B, in which a financial and clinical decision was taken, immediately springs to mind. Would the authority's decision in that case—it was an authority, not a provider—be subject to investigation by the ombudsman? The comments of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0721">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley raise a further issue. A patient might come from the NHS because of a decision that was taken for financial or clinical reasons by someone who was subject to investigation by the ombudsman. Treatment might be refused and the patient forced to move into the private sector as the only alternative, as was the case with child B. If a mistake or poor practice occurred in those circumstances, would an investigation be carried out by the ombudsman?<br><br>
I should like to talk about dentistry, which has become increasingly important in recent years as private practice has mushroomed. Many independent contractors who used to provide NHS dental care have now pulled out completely from the system. I know of many cases in rural Wales. The hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) have no dentists providing NHS treatment in their constituencies. If patients require local dental care, they can use only the private sector. If people feel that they have had poor dental treatment, it is important that they can have recourse to the ombudsman.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister could respond to the points that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was quite a long list of questions. I shall endeavour to be both brief and correct in answering.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rother Valley asked important questions about timing. On Second Reading too, hon. Members commented on how little time was available for measures to be brought into effect. The new health authorities are to be combined on 1 April—I often think how unfortunate it is that so many new developments happen on April Fool's day. The system has to be put into place before that date. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we have already provided interim advice to relevant NHS personnel about the various stages. We have provided a briefing, but we obviously cannot give our final definitive advice until all the statutory proceedings are completed. Matters can change, but we intend to provide final advice as soon as possible.<br><br>
I am sure that all hon. Members will agree that the procedures will not be worth the paper they are written on unless personnel are properly trained and able to imbibe the spirit that lies behind those procedures. So we have paid considerable attention to training over recent months, which will be intensified over the next three months. That will ensure that the service is brought into effect as smoothly as possible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rother Valley asked about stages 1 and 2, although the Bill deals with stage 3. Regulations will be necessary under existing NHS legislation to bring into effect what is covered in the earlier parts. That can be done through statutory instrument, so statutory backing will be in place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are all aware of the situation in the national health service. The real
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
questions are about how stages 1 and 2 will affect the independent sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. The hon. Gentleman also asked me about costs. He made the reasonable point that, while the costs involved are not large when seen as a proportion of the whole NHS budget—£2 billion or £3 billion in England alone, leaving aside Wales and Scotland—they could none the less constitute a large impost on the ordinary GP. If he or she had many complaints, the system would be excessively cumbersome. We have looked into that, as we are bound to, because of our rightly-held desire not to impose excessive burdens on small businesses—GPs are small businesses while hospital trusts are larger businesses—and we calculate that the total annual cost arising from the expanded legislation will be £100,000 to doctors as a whole and £10 per practice. So it is not a large impost. Those calculations are obviously somewhat speculative as we are talking about the likely level of complaints. In relation to the benefits of the scheme, the costs are low.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that that cost of £10 per practice would cover all the training required to make practices aware of their responsibilities and the procedures that must be followed? That cost seems very small for what could be an awaful lot of training.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether it covers training. I think that my figures relate to the annual running costs of the scheme. The complaints that doctors are likely to receive in a year will add up to about £100,000, which is £10 per practice. The NHS will bear the main costs of training because it is the NHS that will mainly service the complaints procedure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rother Valley and other hon. Members asked how the proposals would affect the independent provider as opposed to a provider wholly within the NHS—a doctor or a trust hospital with no private practice. Anyone who supplies an NHS provider with services is subject to the complaints procedures. Anyone who does not supply such a provider is not so subject. In other words, a doctor who supplies services to a private patient is not subject to the procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just getting to that. The Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and the Wilson Committee, which the Government set up, both examined the matter for the health commissioner and drew the same distinction. The parliamentary commissioner deals with complaints about public services, not private services, for which other redress must be sought. The health commissioner is cast in the same mould and operates in the same way, to the same terms of reference and similarly examines the provision of NHS services, not private services. We may wish to take that step in the future, but it would be inconsistent with the views of the Wilson committee, which considered all aspects of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0722">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
the matter, and with those of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration if we were to extend the Bill to cover an arrangement between a private doctor and a private patient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish this point. I understand that the Bill does not exist in isolation, and it is inevitable that private practitioners will have to pay heed to the new procedure that it lays down for NHS service suppliers. Private providers will have no alternative but to take into account the new complaints procedure covering NHS provision and may introduce their own complaints procedure to deal with the sort of example quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen and by the hon. Member for Rother Valley. However, it is not for the Bill to cover purely private arrangements, as it flows from the judgment and views of the Wilson committee and the PCA Select Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I do not want to be unhelpful but there must be no misunderstanding. The report from the PCA Select Committee on the powers, works and jurisdiction of the ombudsman is pivotal to the argument, and I had a hand in it. I should be surprised if the Minister could find a reference in that report that would help him with this matter, despite the general advice that he has been given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman cannot find a reference that would help him, which is why he has not come up with one off the cuff. My impression is that neither the Wilson committee nor the Select Committee has ever believed that the parliamentary commissioner or the health commissioner should be concerned with anything other than the provision of public services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So that we can be absolutely clear, is not it true that both the Wilson committee and the Select Committee were looking at the operation of the NHS ombudsman system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reports from both Committees have been translated into this Bill, and one of the problems that must be grappled with is the extension of remit to independent providers who provide services for NHS patients. An associated question arises, which was raised first by the hon. Member for Batley and Spen: what about the rights of complaint and redress of private patients? That is the key question, and the Minister does not answer it by saying that there have been reports on something else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The relationship between a private patient and a private practitioner is not covered by the Bill. The hon. Gentleman would concede that it would be a huge extension of the conventional notion
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
of the remit of either a parliamentary commissioner or a health commissioner if they were allowed to investigate private matters.<br><br>
As I said, a consequence of the Bill may be that we will examine the questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen and by the hon. Members for Rother Valley and for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright). However, they are not part of the Bill as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend the Minister says, but more people are changing to private medicine and private dentistry, and we should look very seriously at the implications. Paragraph 101 of the Select Committee report referred to by the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The current complaints system in the National Health Service seems designed for the convenience of providers of the service rather than of complainants."</p></blockquote>
I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that the same could apply even in the industry's private sector to which many more of our citizens are turning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. Her quotation about existing practices, even in the NHS, is relevant. I accept that, in some respects, the system is more convenient for the provider than for the complainant. That is why we are introducing the new three-stage procedure—to examine issues from the complainant's point of view.<br><br>
I doubt whether we should have taken the idea a step further and dealt with wholly private matters, especially as that gives rise to litigation and other such problems as raised by the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood. Given that we want to introduce the measures speedily and that there is clearly a wrong to be righted in the NHS, we must act quickly and succinctly to enact the type of Bill that we want. On Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman and I exchanged views about why the whole remit was not wider. One answer is that the idea is difficult and that to go into purely private arrangements represents an entirely new departure. A second answer is that if we want the legislation to be ready by 1 April, extending the remit would be difficult and would raise much wider questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister envisage the three-stage procedure being considered by independent providers for national health service patients who have been referred to them? The debate has suggested that a person independent of the national health service in the provider's establishment—it might be a nursing home—would not be covered by the three stages although an NHS patient would be. It seems that the independent sector will have to take on board the three stages for NHS patients but cannot make the jump to do so for independent ones. Is that what the Minister means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that we are not legislating for that. The hon. Gentleman is pursuing me down the path I was following: once the complaints procedure exists for an NHS patient who might be in a private hospital for whatever reason, others who are not being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0723">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
treated on the NHS might ask why they cannot have such a complaints procedure. Complaints procedures might spring up for purely private matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To pursue exactly the same point, I understand the Minister's attitude, which is clear. Whether it is agreeable is a different question. For the completeness of the record it would be helpful if, either now or later, the Minister could explain what remedy is currently available to people entirely in the private sector. It is not this system; I understand that. What is the system, if there is one? I ask so that when people consider what we have said and examine what can be done, they at least have available the official understanding as part of the record of the Committee's deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be delighted to explain. Perhaps I could write to the hon. Gentleman to set out the answer very plainly. Off the cuff, we have an informal system. First, patients in the private sector have the right to talk to the person who, in their view, delivered unsatisfactory services. That is the first stage of the three-stage procedure and can be done anyway. The ombudsman could not, as such, intervene. Secondly, if the problem concerns a private hospital, it depends whether there is an independent review procedure equivalent to that of an NHS hospital. Such procedures might exist in a private hospital, although they would not be statutorily backed, but informal. Thirdly, in the private sector, litigation is possible—that was rather unfavourably referred to on Second Reading. That is an off-the-cuff reaction; I shall have to write to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey to explain our opinion of what is possible for purely private arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I turn that around slightly? What is the position of wholly private patients within the national health service? Can they take their complaints to the ombudsman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand how a person can be wholly private in the NHS. If a provider has a contract with the NHS, he is subject to the complaints procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden requires some clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some patients who are managed within an NHS hospital pay all their accommodation, drugs and medical bills. They are treated as totally private patients but they are managed in an NHS hospital by NHS staff. Do they have grounds for complaint via the ombudsman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In so far as they receive NHS clinical treatment, clearly they do. Anyone who receives NHS treatment can invoke the complaints procedure. It is, however, a complicated matter; perhaps I can write to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister had better do so.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has highlighted an important point. An awful lot of dentistry, in particular, now involves a proportion of NHS patients and a significant proportion of patients who are in the Denplan scheme or something similar. Given that the Minister thought—although he will seek advice—that a patient in hospital who pays all his or her bills could go to the ombudsman if he or she had a complaint, surely the same would apply in dentistry. Will the Minister consider that matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be dealing with complicated arrangements that differ from case to case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It is an important principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is a principle involved, clearly, it is that any provider of a service, whatever the service may be—whether it is cleaning the ward or conducting an operation—is subject to the complaints procedures if it is provided under and through the NHS. If it is not, the provider is not subject to those procedures. The hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Pembroke are constructing more complicated situations, but I will be happy to write to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we are discussing the procedures for obtaining further information, I wonder whether, when the Minister supplies additional information by letter, he might ask whether his letters should be copied and circulated to members of the Committee, rather than just to the relevant hon. Members. Some of his answers may allay the need for potential amendments and shorten our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two points have been raised, one by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey and the other by the hon. Gentleman on the back row.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My constituency is Strathkelvin and Bearsden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that my Scottish accent is up to it. I shall certainly ascertain whether the answers should be copied to other members of the Committee if there is any doubt.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey wanted to talk about definitions in the light of the four categories. I cannot find the exact regulation, but I can tell him that registration and various practitioners are defined under regulation, if he would like to look them up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was generally aware of that, but I wanted to ensure that the definition in the Bill, which covers
<br><blockquote><p>"persons undertaking to provide … general medical services"</p></blockquote>
and the other three categories are also covered by regulation. We are being asked to put that wording in the Bill but I want to ensure that someone can easily find the list of people who are covered by the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I believe that that is covered by regulation. Nevertheless, it would be helpful to have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0724">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
list of the people concerned. Again, we must return to the point that certain people supply services only through the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all know that it is a nightmare to cross-refer two pieces of legislation and regulations elsewhere. However, I am not aware that the schedule to the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993 covers the matter. As the Minister said, the necessary regulations are provided elsewhere. Perhaps when we tidy up the Bill we need to consolidate the 1993 Act as it will be amended, and provide proper definitions in the Bill through later amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That might be complicated, but it would be sensible to consider a simple list to meet the hon. Gentleman's concerns.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen asked what help the complaints procedure would provide in the unfortunate circumstances she described. There is a limit to what the commissioner can do in such circumstances, but people who received a favourable judgment from a commissioner would have maladministration or clinical misjudgment put on record. Secondly, they would be likely to receive an apology from the hospital trust or doctor. Thirdly, there would be some suggestion of what changes should be made as a result of the mistake. Fourthly, the ombudsman or commissioner will normally follow up recommendations in three months' time, to find out what has happened subsequently.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
None of that directly helps my hon. Friend's constituent, especially if compensation were sought. It would be unusual for the commissioner to recommend directly that compensation be awarded: he has done so in only one or two cases and the compensation typically relates to nuisance value or irritation arising from maladministration. Clinical judgment has not yet been considered. A patient facing the circumstances described by my hon. Friend is not, of course, prevented from taking legal action. In the course of taking such action, the commissioner's judgment could be cited. That might strengthen the case, but the question of negligence is a separate matter, which must be tackled through the courts.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden pointed out that one of the problems of the present procedure is that people often want an explanation, an apology or an acceptance that a mistake was made and an undertaking that change will take place, rather than personal compensation. At the moment, people have to go through the compensation route—heaving a boulder up a hill when they want to move only a few stones along the way. My hope—possibly a vain hope—is that our proposals will help the situation and lead to a lessening of health litigation. Some people may choose the route of our new complaints procedure rather than the legal route.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden also raised the issue of whether managers in the health
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
service will be included. He tabled an amendment, which was not called, on that point. The answer is that managers are covered by the 1993 Act. The hon. Gentleman can be reassured that managers are already covered and can be investigated by the commissioner. Health bodies are already the subject of the health commissioner's remit, so a manager can be got at because he is a manager of a health body. Managers are subject to the existing procedures; that is explicit in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful. If the decision of a manager affects a clinical decision, can it therefore be investigated by the ombudsman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the same point, does the term manager apply to anyone in an administrative or clerical position in the NHS, at any level from the lowest to the highest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I should hate to say men in grey suits because the hon. Gentleman is wearing a conspicuously grey suit. I would not refer to blue suits either because the hon. Member for Rother Valley is wearing one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wearing a grey suit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My suit is neither blue nor grey and, therefore, I am exempt from that charge.<br><br>
The points made by the hon. Members for Cannock and Burntwood and for Ellesmere Port and Neston have been taken on board in our general discussion, as were the remarks of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) about the split between the independent sector and the NHS. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston wanted to know who might be at fault in some circumstances. I cannot help him with that matter, which is for the commissioner to decide. He will examine that matter in his own way and draw his own conclusions about who is at fault in a specific case.<br><br>
The clause is fundamental to the Bill's principle aim: it ensures that the health commissioner will be able to investigate complaints about all services provided to national health service patients, by adding family health service providers and independent providers to the list of cases that may be investigated. We must ensure that NHS patients, wherever their treatments are provided, have the right to have complaints investigated and to take them to the commissioner, if they cannot get satisfaction locally.<br><br>
The 1993 Act allows the commissioner to investigate complaints about health service bodies, which are broadly defined as health service authorities, health boards and NHS trusts. That definition excludes the providers of family health services, which account for the overwhelming majority of contacts between the public and the NHS—in other words, the family doctor. The Bill defines family health service providers as including general practitioners, dentists, pharmacists, family
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0725">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
medical practitioners and optometrists. The commissioner should be allowed to consider complaints about the services that those people provide.<br><br>
By bringing independent providers within the commissioner's jurisdiction, we aim to put beyond doubt the existing presumption that his jurisdiction already covers services that independent providers offer NHS patients. Since the National Health Service Reorganisation Act 1973, under which the commissioner's office was first established, the legislation governing the commissioner's procedure has been intended to allow him to investigate complaints about services provided to patients by independent providers under contract to the NHS. That intention, therefore, has existed for a long time.<br><br>
The Bill clarifies the commissioner's existing powers in section 46 of the 1993 Act, by bringing independent providers expressly within the commissioner's jurisdiction. Independent providers are only covered in so far as they provide services to NHS patients which are relevant to the subject that we have discussed.<br><br>
There is general agreement about the clause's broad purpose and, therefore, I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>', or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(d) a purchasing decision made by a health service body'.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment aims to examine the total provision of health care by bringing into the commissioner's remit a specific ability to investigate purchasing decisions of the health service. The amendment would insert into section 3 of the 1993 Act, which covers the commissioner's remit, the ability to investigate complaints of sustained injustice or hardship as a result of any health service body's purchasing decision. At present, that specific criterion is missing and the commissioner may only investigate failures to provide a service that was a health service body's function, and maladministration.<br><br>
The amendment adds purchasing decisions to the list of subjects to be investigated. A person seeking
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
infertility treatment who lives in a health area where no such treatment has been purchased for the year—sadly, not altogether unheard of in the national health service—would, theoretically, have to trawl through the entire health service system for such treatment. That person could not complain of a failure in service because there would be no service to fail. That person could not complain of a failure to provide a service because no contract to provide pertained. Presumably, that person could not complain of maladministration because the decision not to purchase a service would have been correctly made in the judgment of the relevant body.<br><br>
The only point at which a complaint could be entertained under the proposed structures would be when a health service body which had contracted to provide certain fertility services was unable to do so. That begs the question, why cannot a person complain in advance of being refused treatment due to purchasing priorities? The amendment would rectify that situation.<br><br>
In his paper, "Responsibilities of the Health Commissioner", which should be read in conjunction with the Bill, the commissioner, Mr. William Reid, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the Bill is enacted, all complaints about NHS care … will become subject … to the scrutiny of the Ombudsman".</p></blockquote>
He uses his words advisedly. Although all complaints about NHS care may come under his wing, all complaints about the NHS will not. Where a service is not provided in the first place, a prospective patient cannot complain about it. The remit of the health service commissioner, as defined in section 3 of the 1993 Act, states that a person can only complain if
<br><blockquote><p>"he has sustained injustice or hardship in consequence of a failure … to provide a service which it was the function of the body to provide."</p></blockquote>
That definition of a failure to provide a service is too narrow. It encompasses only those circumstances which were contracted to be provided. It does not include those that were left out of the contracting procedure altogether, and it does not include a service that was not provided because of a lack of funds.<br><br>
The investigation of purchasing decisions will include the ability to investigate those services not purchased by the health service bodies. Surely as much injustice and hardship can be sustained by a patient who cannot get treatment as by one who encounters a failure in treatment. The decisions of some purchasing authorities to withdraw some procedures, not to contract for some services or to limit treatment—it can be described in all such terms—should be open to scrutiny and complaint.<br><br>
The amendment would deal with just one inconsistency and discrepancy in the Bill. We hope to raise other discrepancies later. The purpose of the Bill is to improve, simplify and quicken the complaints procedure in the NHS, but a Bill that falsely limits areas of complaint to some ill-defined set of priorities cannot do that. By removing the bar on the investigation of purchasing decisions, the Bill would be more coherent and closer to the comprehensive ideal set out on Second Reading when it was made

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
clear that the provisions should cover all areas of complaint in the national health service.<br><br>
I support the amendment on the basis that we are concerned not only with care, but with the overall treatment provided by the national health service. The current internal market of purchasing and providing has to be taken fully into account. The Bill does not do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rother Valley. The issue, which we flagged up on Second Reading, is clearly important. It goes to the heart of the boundaries proposed by the Government of the commissioner's responsibility, as rather than the remit of responsibility which lies elsewhere. The issue is of huge concern.<br><br>
The two examples given by the hon. Gentleman are variations on a theme. The first is when the local commissioning authority decides not to provide a service which it believes is not a priority and the second, which is covered by the amendment, is when it buys a service which is inadequate or inappropriate. My local commissioning authority might decide that an elderly patient who needed admission to hospital for psycho-geriatric care would have to go to a hospital in Kent, Sussex, Birmingham or elsewhere. That might be inappropriate because of the necessary travel and other arrangements, but that might be where the contract is provided.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
A contract for children's services might have been purchased from the trust that runs Cardiff royal infirmary, but for all sorts of reasons that might be inappropriate. At the moment, decisions are made by the health authority which negotiates and places the contracts. The health authority is a representative body in one sense, but it has no nominees and there is no way in which an individual can challenge its decision. An authority's decision to place a contract for the coming year is not open to challenge. That is hugely important to millions of people and it is the greatest hole in the Bill.<br><br>
The present system in the national health service is worse than the previous one. Under the previous system, for better or worse, there were at least some elected representatives on the health authority and representations could be made to them. Now, there is no direct point of access and, more importantly, there is no appeal procedure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rother Valley and his colleagues are right to probe the matter with the amendment. I am willing to accept that the amendment is not in the right place, but none of us wants to be told that such an amendment cannot be accepted. If there is a technical reason against it, that can be dealt with, but the matter must be addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister accepted our previous comments that managers are liable to investigation of clinical decisions, the logic is that the purchasing authority should also be liable. We agreed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
that the bill covers clinical decisions, which may be affected by local managers The ombudsman should identify where a decision was made if it was decided that a drug was not to be provided. Similarly, a decision might be made higher up the purchasing authority to fund only four instead of six intensive care beds.<br><br>
A recent case involved a patient in hospital for whom it was clinically appropriate that he be moved to another hospital, but he was not moved, partly because no bed was available. To whom should a complaint be made? If no bed was available to which to transfer the patient, it should be possible for a complaint to be made to the person who was responsible for the bed not being available. The purchasing authority may have made a decision that affects a clinical decision, and the logic of what was said earlier is that the purchasing authority should also be subject to investigation by the ombudsman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that we are discussing hypothetical cases, but I have a feeling that similar cases will, at some stage, come before the ombudsman, presenting him with a difficult choice.<br><br>
I mentioned child B earlier. An expensive course of treatment could have been provided for her on the NHS but a decision was taken not to do so. Initially the arguments in that case related exclusively to cost and only later were we told that the decision was based on a clinical assessment of whether the patient would benefit from the treatment. At a judicial review, the judge found in favour of the health authority.<br><br>
It is possible that, in a similar case, a clinician might say that the matter was not one of clinical judgment, but that he was unable to go ahead with a particular treatment because he did not have sufficient money in his budget on account of the policy of the health authority which provided funds to the hospital in which he worked as an NHS provider? In such a case, based on the purchasing policy of the health authority and not on clinical judgment, would the ombudsman be unable to investigate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting short debate, going to the heart of the issue of the extent of the remit of the commissioner. I can reassure the hon. Member for Rother Valley and other hon. Members who have raised questions that the commissioner will be able to investigate purchasing decisions. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden mentioned a case in which there might be a decision between there being six or four intensive care beds. The commissioner could investigate such a decision. Similarly, a case such as that of child B, raised by the hon. Member for Pembroke—which was a clinical decision—could be investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the clinician had not said that he had made a clinical judgment but had said that he was unable to provide the treatment—which was said to cost £72,000—for financial reasons, would the ombudsman have been able to investigate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. He could consider that. The ombudsman can investigate any decision, including a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0727">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
purchasing decision. However, there are only two grounds on which he can rule that a decision was a bad one: one is clinical judgment, which might have been appropriate in the case of child B; the other is maladministration. Any national health service issue—on clinical judgment, on purchasing or on contracts—can be investigated by the health service commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we had made some progress, but I am not sure. I understand that the commissioner could have investigated the case of child B and ruled that a bad clinical judgment was made. I do not know whether the judgment was in fact a bad one. If the clinician had wanted to give that treatment but the health authority had said that no funding would be provided, would the ombudsman have been able to investigate only whether there had been maladministration? If maladministration was not the issue in such a case, would he be unable to investigate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He can investigate any decision of any kind in the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could he say that to decide not to fund was a bad management decision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He could say that it was maladministration, which term includes an increasingly large list of factors. He judges each case by what is reasonable, just as in a case of clinical judgment he would measure the decision against standards of professional reasonableness—in other words, what would have been a reasonable course of action. In cases of possible maladministration, he would consider what would have been a reasonable course of action; if he decided that a decision was unreasonable—having judged it against common practice in other parts of the country, or professional standards of reasonableness—he could then say that maladministration had occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I cite a case that arose in my constituency concerning the provision of infertility treatment by Rotherham health authority? The authority refused to provide infertility treatment to a couple living in my constituency on the grounds that the female partner—both partners had previously been married—had had a child by a previous husband. The authority refused to spend any more NHS money because it believed that the existence of a child from a previous marriage was a good basis on which to decide to cut off the provision of infertility treatment.<br><br>
I wrote to the authority saying that I objected to its decision. It was wrong because it denied the male partner assistance to father a child. Is the Minister saying that, under those circumstances, my constituent could make a complaint to the ombudsman under this procedure about the decision that denied him fertility treatment to help him father a child in his second marriage?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the ombudsman could investigate such a case, if it was raised by the hon. Gentleman. It is, of course, impossible to say at this stage whether he would decide that the case had been badly handled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the case raises a question of maladministration. Rotherham health authority decided that it would not purchase treatment for my constituent, so denying him infertility treatment, because his wife had had a child by a previous marriage. The decision was solely to do with purchasing. With the amendment, I seek to ensure that, under the Bill, a purchasing decision can be investigated by the commission. In the case I cited, the health authority was wrong. My constituents spent their own money on infertility treatment and so were unable to take the advice I gave them to sue the authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confirm again that cases involving clear clinical need and funding decisions can be investigated by the commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to intervene. He is being almost too helpful when questioned by Opposition Members—I admire his seasonal spirit, but feel an obligation to save him from himself. Will he confirm that, although the ombudsman can investigate any matter, his ability to pronounce on a case is determined entirely by whether the case can be deemed maladministrative or not? Will the Minister also confirm that a certain allocation of resources—even if it causes injustice and hardship to individuals—will not be pronounced maladministrative if the decision has been taken in a proper and reasonable way? That is the essence of the situation. Is not the Minister obfuscating—whether intentionally or not—in the way in which he is responding to interventions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct: any complaint can be investigated. As I said to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, whether the commissioner can reach a verdict, and whether that is disputed, depends upon whether the case involves clinical misjudgment or maladministration.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Those are wide terms, and they depend, in the final analysis, on what is meant by reasonable professional conduct. The commissioner might have decided that the Rotherham health authority case involved unreasonable conduct. The line is not as clear-cut as was suggested by the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright).<br><br>
The commissioner proceeds by casework, so that one case builds on another. I have a long list of what the commissioner might consider when examining maladministration. When we discuss amendment No. 5, which relates to maladministration per se, we shall face the fact that the commissioner cannot put himself in the place of a Minister—or a member of a health authority or a trust—who has made a decision, however unpalatable, if that decision is made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0728">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
reasonably and in accordance with proper standards of professional behaviour. Have I made myself clear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hargreaves <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hall Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood and I serve on the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. The health service commissioner has repeatedly said that he would never be happy to second guess; he wants to take only proper administrative financial, management or political decisions. The amendment that was tabled by the hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Rother Valley should take account of that fact. If the health service commissioner were able to give evidence to the Committee, he would say that he would not wish, under any circumstance, for his position to be prejudiced in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right. All decisions are subject to investigation, including personal decisions. None the less, whether the commissioner is willing to give a verdict on a particular case will depend on whether he believes that it is an example of maladministration or clinical misjudgment. He will not seek to second guess or to drive from the back seat in relation to decisions that are shown to be properly made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are trying to clarify the relevant parameters, although the debate has bounced around a bit. This is a difficult area of definition. I believe that neither the Bill nor the 1993 Act defines maladministration.<br><br>
Will the commissioner be able to investigate whether a purchasing authority has made a reasonable or unreasonable decision? For example, it may have improperly evaluated local needs. Without trying to trap the Minister into a premature response, I should like to consider the issue from the point of view of people who will use the new system. People might think that a purchasing authority had bought inadequate services, and representations about that would be made of which the health authority would be aware. The fact that the health authority ignored that weight of opinion would make its decision an unreasonable one in administrative terms. That is where matters become unclear. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. Hargreaves) said, we should take the commissioner's definition of maladministration and see whether people can turn to the commissioner for remedy. The only alternative is to go to court and claim that a specialty should have been purchased at one hospital rather than another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. In practice, the matter will be made clear by the decisions that are brought to the commissioner. As time evolves, we shall see what decisions are taken in this grey area of how far the commissioner can go in examining decisions made by relevant authorities where it is alleged that matters of clinical need, for example, have been ignored. No doubt the commissioner's remit—which is not wholly clear, as it is built on casework—will be clarified in the fullness of time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Unfortunately, the amendment is technically deficient and its effect would be the opposite of that intended by the hon. Member for Rother Valley. I know that Opposition Members do not have access to the best legal advice, but the amendment would limit the scope of the clause even more than it is limited now. That would not be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the moment to slip past without observing that Government decisions often appear to be made without the benefit of the best advice. Opposition parties often get good advice, but not enough of it is subsidised by the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I have nothing to add.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to some extent with the Minister's response to the debate. I do not know whether the Rotherham area health authority will be pleased, but I shall send it the record of the debate. The infertility treatment offered by the authority may be subject to complaint in the future.<br><br>
I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but Opposition Members will scrutinise carefully what the Minister said about purchasing agreements. That will be important in terms of the comprehensiveness of any new system to be introduced in April next year.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 3, line 10, leave out from "sum" to end of line 11 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"allocated in connection with the provision of family health services.".</p></blockquote>
I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. The amendment tackles a lack of clarity in clause 2 relating to the proposed new section 1B of the 1993 Act. Is the intention to increase or narrow the scope for complaint? I hope that the intention is to create the broadest possible scope for complaint so that patients in fundholding practices can complain about its purchasing decisions. That is consistent with the Minister's remarks. I wish to raise some of the issues that we have discussed in the context of fundholding general practices.<br><br>
Proposed new subsection 1B does not make it clear which alternative is intended. The Royal College of Nursing supports the amendment, but notes that it would be useful for Ministers to state whether users will be able to complain about GP fundholders' allocation of their budgets. It notes that it is not clear whether patients will be able to challenge their GP's purchasing decisions. The amendment would resolve that lack of clarity.<br><br>
Does the clause narrow the scope for complaint? The lack of clarity in proposed new subsection 1B arises from a phrase at the end. It says of proposed new subsection 1A:
<br><blockquote><p>references there to action taken by any person in connection with family health services include references to action taken by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0729">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
person concerned in connection with any allotted sum paid to the members of the practice.</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? Does it mean that complaints can be made only about GP fundholding practices' decisions to pay themselves money or, as I hope it does, that all of their decisions can be subject to complaint? If so, what is the purpose of the reference to the
<br><blockquote><p>"allotted sum paid to the members of the practice"?</p></blockquote>
The amendment would resolve that confusion by making it clear that complaints could be made about any sum that was allocated in connection with the provision of family health services.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will clarify what he had in mind in proposed new subsection 1B and that he will accept the amendment, which is consistent with his intentions and with what the Bill should achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms) pushes at an open door. The wording of the proposed new subsection is designed to widen the health commissioner's remit so that he can consider all aspects of a GP fundholder's use of his resources and of the funds that are allocated to him.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's purpose, and it is encapsulated by the Bill's wording. The words that he would omit are taken from the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 and are the correct terms with which to specify fundholding practices and the resources that are allocated to them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's laudable and absolutely correct amendment falls down on his circular use of words—he in effect defines family health services as family health services. The amendment would have the perverse effect of excluding funds that were used, for example, to pay for drugs and appliances. The amendment's terminology would allow us to consider the general medical services that a GP fundholder provided, but not funds to pay for drugs and appliances.<br><br>
The amendment is right in spirit, but wrong in practice. It would restrict the wider remit that is intended and which is, we believe, correctly phrased in legal terminology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification and confirmation that the clause is intended to address the wider problem. Given that reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

No. 8, in schedule 1, page 8, line 26, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In section 10(1) the words 'or maladministration' shall be omitted.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These important amendments take us back to an issue across which we stumbled a few minutes ago. The Bill would extend the ombudsman's powers and the amendments are designed to address the central issue of where those powers—or a lack of them—turn on the question of maladministration.<br><br>
We are aware at the outset that the word "maladministration" does not occur only at the places in the Bill and in the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993 that are specified in the amendments, but they are designed to trigger a series of revisions which would enable the ombudsman's powers to be seen rather differently.<br><br>
We believe that the restriction of the ombudsman's remit to cases where maladministration can be shown is, as the cases that we have discussed illustrate, unnecessary and unhelpful. Indeed, it conflicts with another phrase which is used in the Bill and in the 1993 Act—the test of injustice and hardship to individuals. We contend that that test, of whether an action or an inaction results in injustice or hardship for individuals, should be the one that is applied by the ombudsman. It should not be allowed to be negated or trumped by the fact that maladministration, as narrowly understood, has not occurred, even when injustice and hardship have.<br><br>
Without detaining members of the Committee with a history of how we got into this fine mess, I shall just say that when the original Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 went through, it contained the wonderful, mystical word "maladministration". No one knew what it meant, although Richard Crossman, the Leader of the House at the time, introduced the Bill and had a go at defining it. He said that it included
<br><blockquote><p>"bias, neglect, inattention, delay, incompetence, ineptitude, perversity, turpitude"—</p></blockquote>
that is a wonderful Wykehamist word—
<br><blockquote><p>"arbitrariness and so on."</p></blockquote>
Thus a system was set up with that mystical word at its centre and with that so-called Crossman catalogue as the explanatory code. An ombudsman then set off to try to make some sense of it.<br><br>
The story goes that the opaque character of the word allowed a delightful flexibility, so that ombudsmen could roam where they would. As the Minister said, various cases have allowed the exploration and extension of what the word means in particular instances. It is interesting that in his 1993 reports, the current Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, Mr. William Reid—a man I like to refer to as "the people's William"—has returned to the Crossman catalogue. The Minister referred to his little list and I suspect that we have the same little list. In his 1993–94 report, the ombudsman had another go at defining maladministration. His list is interesting and I shall quote it:
<br><blockquote><p>"rudeness (though that is matter of degree):</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>unwillingness to treat the complainant as a person with rights:</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0730">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
<br><blockquote><p>refusal to answer reasonable questions;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>neglecting to inform a complainant on request of his or her rights or entitlement;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>knowingly giving advice which is misleading or inadequate;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>ignoring valid advice or overruling considerations which would produce an uncomfortable result for the overruler;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>offering no redress or manifestly disproportionate redress;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>showing bias whether because of colour, sex, or any other grounds;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>omission to notify those who thereby lose a right of appeal;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>faulty procedures;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>failure by management to monitor compliance with adequate procedures;"</p></blockquote>
—we are almost at the end of the list—
<br><blockquote><p>"cavalier disregard of guidance that is intended to be followed in the interests of equitable treatment of those who use a service;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>partiality; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>failure to mitigate the effects of rigid adherence to the letter of the law where that produces manifestly inequitable treatment."</p></blockquote>
That is a fine and wonderfully crafted list. It shows an ombudsman anxious to explore the far horizons of the word "maladministration" in order to prevent hardship and injustice to individuals, but it is also evidence of the tussle to reconcile the criteria of injustice and hardship as the test with the restriction of maladministration.<br><br>
The time has come to remove that tortuous task from the ombudsman. The last item in the list I have just quoted is the most revealing:
<br><blockquote><p>"failure to mitigate the effects of rigid adherence to the letter of the law where that produces manifestly inequitable treatment."</p></blockquote>
That is the ombudsman's attempt to say that he is aware of the problem. However, even if the rules are applied properly and there is no technical maladministration, injustice and hardship can still result. Instead of this elaborate wriggling and playing with words, how much better it would be if Parliament decided that it would make injustice and hardship the test and remove the unnecessary restriction which the Government seek to persuade us—as the Minister did this morning—is not as bad as it sounds. But it is as bad as it sounds and this is surely the time to get rid of it.<br><br>
Other ombudsman systems seek to address the problems of injustice and hardship even when the rules have been properly applied. Rules can often be applied in ways that produce absurd and unfair consequences; an ombudsman system must get at that by preventing people from hiding behind the defence that they applied the rules. If rules result in manifestly unjust outcomes for individuals, the ombudsman's remit should clearly cover that. The Bill forces us to confront that issue because it introduces a contradiction into that remit. On the one hand, for clinical complaints, how else could problems be dealt with? The merits of any decision have to be examined to check whether what was done was properly done in clinical terms. It is not just a question of checking that the problem was dealt with correctly procedurally, but whether injustice and hardship resulted. For example, a surgeon might cut off the right leg instead of the left.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Batley and Spen says with emphasis, they have done. Given his interesting political trajectory, the Minister might have difficulties distinguishing left from right, but that disability would not be tolerated in surgeons. If they meant to do the left leg and got the right instead, their decision would be wrong, even had all the procedures been properly followed, the tests ordered and everything put in place. A manifest injustice and hardship resulted. The Bill sets out a system to enable the ombudsman to roam freely and to pronounce on the demerits of such decisions.<br><br>
Yet there is a contradiction: for purely administrative actions, we are told that as long as a decision is not maladministered, even if we wriggle around the words, the ombudsman's remit will not stretch that far. That is intolerable. Now is the moment to recognise that contradiction and resolve it. The Government brought us to the moment by introducing the Bill. The contradiction could easily be resolved as the language already exists in the Bill. It is the language of injustice and hardship to individuals. Anything that causes injustice and hardship to individuals should be within the ombudsman's jurisdiction. That is the principle to hang on to and now is the moment to do so and, in so doing, to wave goodbye to the splendid 1960s word "maladministration". All would then become clear, the remit would be straightforward, and we should all be better off as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's illuminating speech. I cannot quite concur with his definition of left and right, certainly in surgical terms. I advise him to examine rather more lengthily the parliamentary commissioner's list of what can be investigated. The hon. Gentleman tried to imply—and did himself an injustice to some extent—that the list was rather narrower than it is. The hon. Gentleman's list was about the process of administration, but the commissioner can consider—and has considered—not merely process decisions but whether decisions themselves are reasonable in the light of what could be termed current professional standards. A decision itself, not merely the process by which it was reached, can be questioned if the commissioner thinks that it was taken in such an unreasonable spirit that it amounts to maladministration. So, we can add the decision itself to the hon. Gentleman's rather long list.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made the fair point that the problem has grown over time. We can feel the ambit of the commissioner pressing against the original conception of what the role was about. He is taking greater cognisance of the sorts of circumstances that arise in day-to-day life. They are not all subject to black and white decisions, but the commissioner is taking more into his ambit.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Since Richard Crossman's definition was given in 1966, the whole process has widened and I suspect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0731">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
that it will continue to widen. Indeed, we have already seen one possible widening in this morning's debate. Since private providers are being brought for the first time into the NHS—in relation to GPs' services, not trust services—we have seen that there could be a knock-on effect in complaints procedures. It is an evolving process, which is rational, sensible and philosophically correct. Nothing is wrong with evolution; it is a perfectly respectable process. There is often no need for revolutionary steps, which would be necessary if everything in the ambit of the commissioner were included—beyond maladministration or clinical misjudgment.<br><br>
In his calmer moments, would the hon. Gentleman agree that every decision taken by a politician or administrator should be second guessed? We have a role in life too and we have to accept the consequences of decisions that we take, whether they are general decisions about the distribution of resouces in public expenditure or specific decisions about the NHS. We are accountable before Parliament and the public for our decisions.<br><br>
Is it right for a commissioner to go beyond the remit of the existing Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and the health service commissioner in a manner that has never been suggested before—to cover matters outside maladministration or clinical misjudgment? That would enshrine a wholly new element in the constitution, quite beyond the bounds of what is essentially a slim-build attempt to put sensible provisions in place to improve the complaints procedure of the national health service.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood appears to want more—I noted that in his speech on Second Reading—so perhaps he should introduce a private Member's Bill to consider the purpose of the parliamentary commissioner, whose ambit he wants to extend way beyond its present scope. It is odd for the parliamentary commissioner to be bound by existing statute, yet for the health commissioner suddenly to be given a wide new range of responsibilities and powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister is historically right. The quotation to which my hon. Friend referred includes the catch-all phrase at the end—"and so on". The Minister talked about second guessing, but he is in difficulty in second guessing Richard Crossman at the moment. Richard Crossman's terms refer to
<br><blockquote><p>"bias, neglect, inattention, delay, incompetence, ineptitude, perversity, turpitude, arbitrariness and so on."</p></blockquote>
No finite list was created, so is it not reasonable for us to be more explicit and seek to define what "and so on" means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said before and suspect I shall have to say again, this is a matter for the commissioner as he develops case work in this area. We cannot second guess the commissioner, who will have to deal with haphazard cases. We do not know exactly what he will be asked to investigate. Case
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
practice will be established as a result of his decisions.<br><br>
As a matter o f principle—leaving aside how the commissioner is already approaching his work load—surely it cannot be right to extend the health commissioner's remit way beyond that of the parliamentary commissioner. The health commissioner would have come in at a later stage in the history of these matters but would have a wider remit than the Parliamentary Commissioner. Moreover, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hall Green said, the health commissioner would be able to second guess decisions made legitimately—however much the hon. Gentleman may disagree with them—by politicians or administrators, and that is clearly not the function of the parliamentary commissioner. It has never been the Select Committee's view that that should be the function of the parliamentary commissioner.<br><br>
While I understand what the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood is driving at, it would be taking things too far in the context of the Bill. I must, therefore, ask him to reconsider the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the Minister's approach. The Government had the opportunity to introduce a more extensive Bill. Indeed, representations were made to the Government by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey), who is the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. He wrote to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster asking for a more extensive Bill that would deal with a number of important revisions to the remit and powers of the ombudsman as recommended in the report to which we referred earlier.<br><br>
It is interesting that in Lord Nolan's report he remarked on that fact and expressed a hope that the Government would take an early legislative opportunity to revise the ombudsman's powers, not least to catch quangos, which have caused the Government so much trouble. One particular recommendation was for a jurisdictional re-definition: it would be a decisive change for the ombudsman to be able to roam whatever areas were covered by public administration. That opportunity was available. I have a letter from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to the Chairman of the Select Committee. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We thought seriously about including in the Bill the provisions necessary to implement your Committee's recommendations."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that the Government regretted that they were not able to do so. I regret that, too.<br><br>
The bipartisanship of our proceedings would have made it possible to pass a larger Bill extremely quickly so that it would not have prevented the new arrangements coming into force on 1 April and would have dealt with some of these pivotal questions, one of which is behind the amendments on maladministration.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the Minister refer to this as a major constitutional moment. I invite the Minister to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0732">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
read the debates that took place when the ombudsman system was established back in 1966. Lord Hailsham, who was leading for the Conservative Opposition of the day, said that it was a monstrous constitutional departure and that the sky would fall in because Members of Parliament would no longer chase citizens' grievances: people would run to the ombudsman and that was a major re-ordering of the constitution which would have horrendous consequences.<br><br>
I am immune to these warnings about the sky falling in: skies rarely fall in and they certainly do not fall in when modest changes are made to arrangements that are designed to benefit citizens. It is possible, even without a more extensive Bill, to remove the restriction that surrounds the word "maladministration"—at least in the NHS—and prevent the need for elaborate catalogues of conditioning clauses to make the word usable by an ombudsman. There is no need for all that. A simple test would be that, if any action or inaction caused injustice or hardship to individuals, the ombudsman would have the power to investigate and pronounce. That would save us from the actions of bureaucrats who, following the rule book absolutely, came to monstrous conclusions. I am sure that that is the spirit of what the Minister would like to do. I urge him to have the courage to go all the way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hargreaves</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel that the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood, who is a colleague of mine on the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, is being a little disingenuous, or is stretching matters a little too far, if he is suggesting that the Select Committee recommended, in a letter from the Chairman to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a redefinition of the word "administration" in terms similar to those in his amendment. That is not the case. The Select Committee did not reach unanimous agreement on a redefinition of that word, particularly in relation to decisions that several hon. Members, including the hon. Gentleman, feared might bring the role and judgment of the ombudsman into conflict with properly reached administrative, managerial or political decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Tam Galbraith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are confusing me with my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both distinguished Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but he has more hair than me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And more years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and more years than me.<br><br>
We are considering an important principle. It is increasingly clear that lawyers, judges and, I presume, health service ombudsmen, base their judgments on what is said in Committee and on the intentions underlying the Bill, as defined by Ministers and other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
hon. Members. That is why our debate is important. I shall return to that issue when we consider clause 5.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood was right to ask for the removal of the word "maladministration". It is time that it was removed. Such a technical, procedural and mechanistic device is not relevant to the purpose of the Bill.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister that the Bill is narrow. Its main object is to bring clinical judgment within the remit of the ombudsman, but that raises important principles on the handling of clinical judgment and other health service decisions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood pointed out, procedures can be followed exactly with no maladministration, but a wrong decision might still be taken. Let us consider a possible scenario with a particularly pedantic doctor. He might take down the patient's history for up to two hours and follow that with a clinical examination, a differential diagnosis, investigations, further consideration, revision of the clinical diagnosis and further investigations. A doctor could follow all the correct procedure, but make the wrong decision. That would not count as maladministration, however, because no administrative mistakes were made and everything was written down.<br><br>
It would be wrong for the ombudsman to take that view of clinical decisions. After all, the administrative procedure has been gone through—judgment is what counts. The important issue is whether the judgment was correct, not the administration. That would be the correct approach for considering a clinical decision. Why should it be different for administration? Why should the ombudsman consider only whether the technical procedures were followed all along the line? At some stage an issue of judgment will arise.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood wants to include the concept of injustice and hardship in the clause. A clinical decision which results in hardship might not be the wrong clinical decision, provided that that hardship was predefined as a possible outcome and taken into consideration. I wonder whether the terms of the clause could be better defined to include only hardship that was not accounted for or taken into consideration when making the clinical judgment.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
I hope that I am not being too elaborate. We have agreed that different principles will not be applied to different decisions. A clinical decision which results in hardship or injustice should not be subject to a judgment if an administrative decision with a similar result is not considered improper if the correct procedures are followed. I emphasise that not every decision, whether administrative or clinical, that results in injustice and hardship will be wrong. Provided that hardship and injustice are considered as a possible outcome and identified by the hospital authority, such a decision may be proper. The general manager may say that a decision could result in hardship for X and injustice for Y, but failure to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
that initially should be grounds for a charge of wrong judgment, not just maladministration, if hardship or injustice result. We are considering two separate matters—clinical judgment and managerial judgment—and the same principles should apply to both.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden homed in on whether there was a difference in the way in which we consider clinical judgment and maladministration. He advocated that we consider those matters as similarly as possible. That was the gist of his comments. When considering maladministration, it may be necessay to consider whether a judgment was correct and not just whether the procedure under which it was arrived at was correct in the light of responsible professional standards.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood said that it is possible for a decision that was properly made to lead to monstrous conclusions. If the commissioner felt that a decision had led to monstrous conclusions, even if properly arrived at, he could consider that because over the years he has expanded his remit to include what is reasonable in terms of proper managerial conduct. Similarly, when considering clinical judgment, he will consider judgment per se, as the hon. Gentleman said. The two matters are not as far apart as is being suggested and there is a narrowing gap between the way in which the two concepts are examined. That gap will tend to get narrower because, after all, the commissioner is operating on the basis of what is reasonable and on what flows from the case work he receives.<br><br>
We cannot accept the principle that the PCA Select Committee was wrong to abdure to the parliamentary commissioner the second-guessing remit. The hon. Gentleman is wrong on that matter. Even after the correspondence between the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chairman of the PCA Select Committee—my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth—about the matter, we never intended to include in the ambit of the Bill anything to do with second-guessing decisions that were properly—not maladministratively—reached.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I cite an example that may be helpful? I refer to the general remit of the parliamentary commissioner, but the word "maladministration" dogs both systems. The ombudsman and the Department of Transport are currently locked in combat over a report that the ombudsman recently produced about the channel tunnel rail link—an interesting example because it puts to the test some of the Minister's assurances. I do not want to go into the history of how the line of route of the rail link has changed many times over many years. Many people who live in those parts of the south of England where the route has been changed have, however, suffered hardship because of the adverse effect on property prices of those changes. Some of those people approached the ombudsman through their Members of Parliament. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
ombudsman carried out an investigation, produced a report and decided that there had been injustice and hardship. He found that some of the individuals whose cases he had explored in detail could not move to care for elderly relatives because their houses were rendered unsellable by the series of policy changes into which they were locked. The rules said that a house had to be so many metres from the railway line. In one case, the railway line was to be underground, so the requisite number of metres—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am being lenient. If that is an intervention, it is excessively long. I frown upon excessively long interventions. If the hon. Gentleman wants to contribute to our debate after the Minister has spoken, he may do so. However, if he does not want to do so, I hope that he will bring his intervention to a fast conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My intervention was designed to be excessively helpful and I apologise if it strayed into other paths. However, perhaps I should return to that subject later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The letters exchanged between the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, the Chairman of the PCA Select Committee, did not envisage including in the Bill's provisions matters of the type to which the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood referred. Those letters related to the procedure for the selection and financing of the parliamentary commissioner. I do not think, therefore, that he can pray that correspondence in aid.<br><br>
I accept that there is a difference in principle between what the hon. Gentleman advocates and what is advocated by my hon. Friend the Member for Hall Green: we should not put the parliamentary commissioner in a position where he is perpetually second-guessing decisions properly arrived at without maladministration, and that are not subject to dispute on grounds of clinical judgment. That would be a step too far for a Bill of this type. The Bill is, after all, an amending Bill—it is not major legislation.<br><br>
I must point out that, as all three amendments are also technically defective, they would make matters even worse. That is another reason why I have to disagree with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure how the transcript of that previous exchange will read. The Minister said that the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood in his intervention were not covered by the Bill's provisions because he referred to matters related to railways. We can agree on that.<br><br>
What confuses me about the difference between injustice, clinical judgment and maladministration can be illustrated again by events at the Countess of Chester hospital. Up to a year ago, it had an unfortunate set of procedures. In order to determine access to some specialist heart services, it discriminated on the basis of age. Relatives of a person who died in the hospital considered that discrimination a massive injustice. According to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0734">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
Bill's provisions, is that discrimination a matter of clinical judgment or maladministration? I suspect that it is neither.<br><br>
We need to think carefully about how we can deal with such matters. Does not the Minister think that the relatives of the deceased had a reasonable case which should have been addressed? It may be that the decision was necessary because of the resources available, but there is no question that if any one of us were in the shoes of the family of the deceased, we would feel that there had been a massive injustice. The hospital could easily mount a defence to argue that the case fell outside the remit of the commissioner as stipulated in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lest my helpful example were to be lost to posterity, I should like to complete it because it would help to elucidate what maladministration involves.<br><br>
The ombudsman pronounced on the injustice and hardship caused to the individuals because of the endless policy changes on the line of the channel tunnel rail link. A report was presented. In response, the Government said, "We deny that this is maladministration. We did everything properly. We considered the options. We did this and did that. Yes, we changed our minds several times, but these were the reasons." The result of operating in that way, however, produced injustice and hardship. The ombudsman had to cast his report in a form which said that the injustice and hardship was a product of maladministration and that the maladministration was of a kind which involved not thinking about the possibility of injustice and of inflicting hardship on individuals when considering different policy options. The ombudsman's approach is still the subject of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
battle between him and the Department of Transport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hargreaves</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the hon. Gentleman? His memory will serve him right when he recalls that the delay element referred to by the commissioner was the key cause of such exceptional distress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be nice to continue in our current spirit of consensus, but the delay was merely a component of the problem. It would be a distraction to consider all the reasons given by the ombudsman. The one that should interest us, which turns on the argument of maladministration, was that the ombudsman wanted to use the concept of maladministration to embrace matters that the Government said were not covered by maladministration. The ombudsman used his list to say, "This is maladministration." The Government said, "Oh no it's not." It is a bit like a Christmas pantomime—everyone laughs and we are locked into stalemate.<br><br>
The trump card has been produced. I have been told that the amendments are technically deficient, so I will beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
