</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we rose for lunch, we were reflecting on the research findings of Professor Rebecca Bailey-Harris in an article in <i>Family Law</i> of November 1995. She raised an issue that we shall consider in our debate on reconciliation—bearing in mind the House's decision to extend the period for reflection and consideration from 12 to 18 months. When the article was written, the proposal was for a 12-month period of reflection.<br><br>
The Committee will have very much in mind the question that was raised in the article when considering the role of counselling for reconciliation and when that should take place. Referring to the 12-month period, Professor Bailey-Harris asked:
<br><blockquote><p>"Will it be conducive to the reconciliation of those whose marriages are in trouble, or will it, conversely, have a hardening effect on attitudes? It would seem likely that in the vast majority of cases there will be no reconsideration by at least the spouse who has already taken the crucial and formalised step of initiating the process."</p></blockquote>
It is before that initial and formalised step has been taken—before the statement has been filed—that we believe that it is necessary to intervene strongly to create a pathway to reconciliation. Professor Bailey-Harris goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst the initiating statement is presented in the White Paper as a neutral document in that no accusations are permitted to be contained in it, in reality, it can scarcely be so. The non-initiating spouse is likely to regard herself or himself as having effectively been served with a notice of the other party's intention to quit the marriage, and for reasons which need not be disclosed—a perception not conducive to generosity."</p></blockquote>
Professor Bailey-Harris makes a strong point. We understand the problems with the petition, but at least it gave a sense that there was a cause, whether or not that was accepted. The danger of the procedure in the Bill is that no cause has to be shown. It is just a statement that the marriage has broken down. It would be a mistake to believe that that, of itself, would necessarily be conducive to reconciliation; nor would it necessarily be conducive even to the absence of bitterness and enmity.<br><br>
The advantage of counselling, whether for the purposes of exploring whether the marriage can be saved or for the purposes of coping with the trauma of divorce, is that it gives all the parties the opportunity to examine the underlying causes of the crisis in the relationship. It also gives the parties the opportunity to come to terms with those causes, either as a way of bringing them back together and saving the marriage, or of better equipping the parties to move forward into joint and agreed responses to the needs of the children, or into more successful second relationships. All the evidence shows that a second marriage is even more likely to fail than the first. That is a disturbing feature of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
relationship problems. Lessons are not necessarily learnt from the first experience of a broken relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying. He is not arguing for fault-based divorce, although it sounds a little like that at times, but I wonder whether he is arguing for some form of statement of reasons being given in the initial application. If not, how would he resolve the problem that he has identified?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing for a return to fault-based divorce. I am simply pointing out the consequences of abandoning that mechanism, because they need to be recognised. I accept that we have abandoned that mechanism, rightly. We must therefore consider the alternatives. The great problem with family law, which has beset every attempt this century to deal with family law reform, is that the rhetoric and the reality seldom meet. The circumstances of breakdown are not altered by changing the rhetoric. In the breakdown of any relationship there is a sense of guilt, fault and culpability.<br><br>
I admire the fact that, in New Zealand and Australia, that has been recognised. Fault has been eliminated from the legal process of divorce in those countries, and it has been recognised that a new context must be put in place. Counselling provides that context. That is a strong argument for recognising what various forms of counselling have to offer.<br><br>
Our plea, through the amendment, is that the Government should accept that a space, opportunity and pathways into counselling must be written into the Bill. From counselling one can best explore the hope of reconciliation, if such hope exists, and one can try to deal with the trauma that is the inevitable consequence of divorce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is all very interesting, but how will such pathways be written in? The initial application is a statement that initiates the divorce procedure. With his pathways into counselling, the hon. Gentleman is suggesting some sort of pre-notice—perhaps an "I'm not happy, dear" notice. How would the hon. Gentleman achieve his objective? People must be allowed to realise in their own good time that things are not going well. They can do something to rectify matters, or they can initiate divorce proceedings.<br><br>
We cannot legislate to make people go to counselling if they do not want to. We can offer them the opportunity to take counselling and to be aware of its possible benefits, but we cannot write into the Bill a procedure whereby someone can formally tell his wife that he is not very happy with the way that she is conducting herself, and that unless she mends her ways, he will consider making a statement that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not choose to put the matter as the hon. Gentleman puts it. I urge him to recognise that when people initially consider divorce and take the first step, a proportion of them go to solicitors as a cry for help. We know that to be the case—it is not seriously
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
disputed by anybody. Let us presume that, under the Bill, they go to the information session as a cry for help. We argue that, from the information session, there must be a clearly defined pathway into an opportunity to meet privately with someone qualified as a marriage guidance counsellor. The party having taken the initiating step, the counsellor can discuss what might be done in each individual case.<br><br>
That is all that the amendment seeks. It would create a step between an information session and the statement of divorce. Knowing how things are, I suspect that the Minister will say that it is not practical. If he does, it will be incumbent on us to devise a mechanism that is practical. The Minister may suggest that we should examine again the content of the information meeting, but we believe that that meeting—or a meeting, however it is arrived at—should be generally available.<br><br>
In November 1994, the National Association of Family Mediation and Conciliation Services laid down a number of criteria for what constitutes effective information meetings. The association's criteria were:
<br><blockquote><p>"a down-to-earth understanding of people's reactions to marriage crises and a trained ability to respond to them constructively…sensitivity and skill on the part of the interviewer as to where the marriage has reached—is it an early or late stage of dissolution. Timing and sensitivity are crucial as people are in a raw emotional state".</p></blockquote>
Another criterion laid down by National Family Mediation is
<br><blockquote><p>"the competence to identify domestic violence".</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members will remember how my hon. Friends and I voted on that issue this morning: the wider public will remember how a number of Conservative Members voted. National Family Mediation says that those entrusted with and exercising a function under the Bill should bear in mind and have the competence to identify domestic violence. That is precisely what we told the Minister this morning, yet Conservative Members rejected our amendment.<br><br>
National Family Mediation give other criteria:
<br><blockquote><p>"local information, well presented … a sound and practical understanding of the legal process … a sound and practical understanding of children's reactions to marriage breakdown".</p></blockquote>
All those criteria cry out for a qualified person to be available. That is why the amendment stipulates that meetings should be available with a qualified marriage guidance counsellor—someone whose training and qualifications are approved by the Lord Chancellor. A way should be found to enable such meetings to take place and to give people the opportunity to participate in them. That may save some marriages. The importance of universal availability is that even when such a meeting does not save a marriage, it will ease the process and reduce the negative impact on the children and the parties themselves—an impact that will probably be with many if not all of those children in one way or another for the rest of their lives.<br><br>
We have a duty to adopt a practical proposal to help to deal with the real worries of those engaged in the day-to-day work of saving marriages—people who see the benefit of saving marraiges. Our duty is to produce a practical mechanism by which that might be achieved.<br><br>

4.45 pm<br><br>
It is in that spirit and with that intent that I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important group of amendments. We should be grateful to the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) for introducing them as he did. The Committee is united in thinking that there must at the very least be opportunity and encouragement for marriage counselling. Obviously, in many cases, divorce has been coming for a long time and marriage counselling would make no difference. But we know that each year between 20,000 and 30,000 couples change their mind about divorce, so there is clearly a role for marriage counselling.<br><br>
It is important that I structure my speech so as to explain to the Committee how some of us who have taken a close interest in the matter have been trying to achieve consensus around the Committee. We accept that marriage counselling is important—it is vital that there be an opportunity for it. We also accept that we cannot compel people to undertake a course of marriage counselling. I have taken the opportunity during the past week to talk to people who work in the field and have myself come to the conclusion that that could be counterproductive. In a free society, we cannot compel people to attend marriage counselling sessions. If we did, that might reduce the status of marriage counselling and make the whole process counterproductive.<br><br>
In the initial amendments tabled by me and by the hon. Member for Brent, South, we both proposed—independently, of course—that there should be marriage counselling and a cooling-off period. As I understand it, the cooling-off period proposed by the hon. Gentleman would last between six and eight weeks. The cooling-off period that I propose is 12 weeks. I would not go to the wall over the difference. The important point is that there should be a substantial cooling-off period.<br><br>
It is important to have the cooling-off period before a statement is filed. When people file a statement, they are effectively saying that their marriage has broken down, so there should be a cooling-off period before that, which could be used to hold a session with a marriage counsellor. So we are united on that issue.<br><br>
I discussed the matter with my hon. Friend the Minister and other hon. Friends and people interested in the field. The Minister made the point that I made a few moments ago—we cannot compel people to undertake marriage counselling. I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Brent, South, but I do not think that he wants to compel people to undertake marriage counselling either. What I—and the hon. Gentleman, I think—had in mind was that people would attend some kind of information meeting with a marriage counsellor. In the overwhelming majority of cases—when people have thought the matter through carefully—that would be the end of it. But there would at least be the opportunity represented by such an information meeting, after which the process could be extended if people wanted. That is why we wanted a cooling-off period.<br><br>
However, it appeared from the wording of my amendments and those tabled by the hon. Gentleman—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
it is exactly the same, apart from the different length of the cooling-off period—that there would be an element of compulsion. That is what exercised and worried my hon. Friend the Minister. So I then tried to find another way around the problem—no matter where we come from in this debate, we are all trying to agree. I consider the best way forward to be a compulsory initial information meeting. That is already provided for in the Bill, but the trouble is that at present it could just mean turning up to a local citizens advice bureau—whether on one's own or with other people—and being put in front of a video, or being given a leaflet entitled "How to get a divorce" printed by the Lord Chancellor's Department. That would not constitute what I consider to be a serious information meeting.<br><br>
Even if a serious information meeting were to be properly held—without videos who would hold it? Would it be someone who had a stake in the divorce process, such as a divorce lawyer or a mediator?<br><br>
We are creating a new career structure. I have been told of family lawyers currently engaged in firms of solicitors who will become mediators. Like many other people, I am worried about whether information would be held by people with a financial stake in the process—I am not saying that that is improper—who would not go out of their way, any more than a solicitor does now, to encourage people to engage in marriage counselling.<br><br>
I believe that it would be best to retain the compulsory information meeting, but that that meeting should be taken by a qualified and genuinely independent person. The Minister should decide, through regulations, who that person should be. We cannot decide that, although I have tabled an amendment that would ensure that the person was independent and qualified—for example, a registrar of births, deaths and marriages.<br><br>
The information meeting should be held on a one-to-one basis. One would not attend it with a group of people, but singly or as a couple, although I accept that we cannot force people to go as a couple. At the meeting, people should be given the opportunity, and be encouraged—not compelled—to undergo marriage counselling. They should be told that, if they are legally aided, the meeting with the marriage counsellor would be free.<br><br>
Before the close of business on Thursday, I tabled a series of amendments to clauses 6 and 8 that would achieve precisely what I have described. Amendment No. 89 would provide for a minimum three-month gap between the information meeting and the statement of marital breakdown that starts the divorce proceedings. Amendment No. 90 would require the meeting to be held on a one-to-one basis. Amendment No. 91 is consequential to amendment No. 92, which would ensure that the party or parties were given the opportunity for a voluntary meeting with a marriage counsellor, and that they were encouraged to hold such a meeting. Amendment No. 93 would require that the meeting be conducted by a qualified person who has no financial interest in divorce proceedings, rather than a mediator or lawyer who would subsequently act in that divorce. Amendment No. 94 would ensure that the meeting with a marriage counsellor was free of charge for those who qualify for full legal aid.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make something clear? I get the impression that the hon. Gentleman is talking about a couple who have fallen out almost overnight. My experience in the matter—which is limited compared with that of lawyers—is that, usually, there has been a longstanding problem in the marriage and that, to all intents and purposes, the marriage has broken down for perhaps one, two or even 10 years.<br><br>
I am worried lest the people who want advice or to take action to end their disastrous marriage be assumed to be having a Saturday-night tiff, rather than to have thought about the matter for a long time before taking that incredible step of saying, "Enough is enough"; only to be asked, "Are you sure about that after only two or three years?" There seems to be an assumption that people have made a quick decision rather than a long-term deliberation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman made that point, as I want to make it clear that I agree with him. I accept that in 80, 90 or 95 per cent. of marriages, people have thought deeply about the matter and there is no hope of saving the marriage. I accept that that is a serious decision, and that an information meeting or marriage counselling will make no difference.<br><br>
However, we know that 20,000 to 30,000 couples change their minds, and that a percentage of marriages are saveable. Last week, I was told by Mrs. Corbett, the director of the Catholic marriage guidance service—it is experienced in the field—that up to 10 per cent. of the marriages of the couples who visited the service could be preserved. I thought that she was impressive; she made the point that marriage is having to bear the strain of society's shortcomings—increasing insecurity and so on. People receive no guidance during their marriages. No guidance is given at critical times, such as after the birth of a first child. She forcefully made the point—as would any marriage guidance organisation, such as Relate—that marriage guidance has a role to play even at a very late stage.<br><br>
We do not know whether a session with a marriage counsellor could save 1, 2 or 5 per cent. of marriages. However, if it saved 5 per cent.—not an unreasonable assumption—it would have an enormously beneficial effect on society. That is why this debate, which the hon. Member for Brent, South initiated, is so vital. We have an opportunity here to do some good; we can save a few marriages. That is why I drafted my amendments in this way.<br><br>
I would be prepared to withdraw amendment No. 34, about which there was some doubt; people said that I was trying to compel people to see marriage counsellors. I would not compel anyone to see a marriage counsellor. Under the Bill, people must go to an information meeting. All I am saying is that, given the fact that the Government in their wisdom have decided that people must attend information meetings, we should make them worthwhile events. Let us ensure that information meetings are held with someone who, according to rules and regulations, has some sort of qualification in such matters and is genuinely independent.<br><br>

Does the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) deny that if people were told about the prospect of marriage counselling—not ordered to take part in it, just told about it—no harm would be done? What possible harm could it do? Perhaps, in 90 per cent. of marriages, people would say that they did not want to see a marriage counsellor; but in a few cases, people would say that they did. We should therefore give them an opportunity to do so.<br><br>
If the Government were to accept this group of amendments, it would be a huge breakthrough. For the first time, the Government would fund marriage counselling. From what the Library tells us, we know that divorce costs us £5 billion a year and we know that the Government give £3 million a year to help to buttress marriage—a point that people such as Cardinal Hume make time and again. For the first time, the Government would be saying, "We shall fund marriage counselling on the same basis as we fund divorce lawyers to facilitate divorce or as we shall fund mediation under the Bill." That represents an opportunity greatly to improve the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He has just said that families are facing "increasing insecurity". Will he tell us about the nature of that insecurity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to get involved in politics: we have enough politics in this place. For the sake of argument, let us say that the Opposition think that it is all the Government's fault, but Conservative Members think that more complex factors are at work in society. However, life is increasingly insecure. There are huge pressures on people, but I shall not get into an argument about whether that is the Government's fault. Marriage is having to take the strain and, in many cases, it cannot cope. That is what the Committee must grapple with.<br><br>
I have said all that I want to say, but I hope that, when the Committee has had a chance to digest what I have said, it will consider that the amendments that I have tabled on clauses 6 and 8—I apologise, Sir Patick, for mentioning clause 8, which follows on from clause 6—represent a sensible compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my voice in support of this group of amendments. To judge by the Australian experience—referred to earlier by the hon. Member for Brent, South—even if a marriage is not saved and everyone agrees that it has broken down, the trauma is lessened if there has been counselling beforehand. It is worth while and we should bear that in mind.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I also listened carefully to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). I know that we cannot save every marriage; unfortunately, marriages break up. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the figure of 5 per cent., which I think might be a modest estimate; but if even 5 per cent. of marriages were saved, there would be a huge saving in terms of anxiety for the families involved, society generally and, of course, the public purse via the court service, the legal

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
aid fund, and so on. So it is definitely worth including the provision of counselling in the Bill.<br><br>
If a marriage clearly cannot be saved, it behoves all of us in the Committee to ensure that the ending of the marriage should be as painless as possible. I believe that counselling would contribute to that. This is a Bill on family law—it is not called the divorce Bill, so it should encompass the need for counselling, which is all-important when we consider family law in general and divorce law in particular.<br><br>
It was said earlier that many people go to solicitors as a cry for help. I speak from experience and I have frequently invited clients to come back in a week's time after they have reflected on the various matters that they have discussed. Not being a particularly avaricious lawyer, of the type we are sometimes held out to be, I frequently found that such clients did not return, or they would send a note saying that they had thought better of it and perhaps were wrong to initiate proceedings. I know of colleagues in other firms in other areas who, as soon as anybody walks through the door, sign up papers and lodge the matter with the court. From that point onwards, it becomes more and more difficult to withdraw without losing face.<br><br>
There is certainly an element of a solicitor acting almost as a social worker as he listens to initial complaints, and so on. I am not making heavy weather of the point, nor am I saying that solicitors are not sympathetic to the information that they hear. However, they are not qualified as counsellors and are not yet qualified as mediators either. We desperately need a vehicle in the Bill for providing counselling. If it is not included because of a cost implication, we shall never see it. With all the good will in the world and all the statements that we have heard during the proceedings of this rather controversial Bill, unless counselling is included as a provision, we can forget about it.<br><br>
With all the good intentions that may or may not have been made apparent during the past few months, we should remind ourselves of the contents of a speech made on 3 April by the Lord Chancellor when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is giving careful consideration to the need to support marriage and the family across a broad range of policy areas, but I would like us to focus specifically today upon what I intend to call 'marriage support services'… This includes marriage guidance or marriage counselling. It also includes initiatives aimed at marriage preparation and services providing information packs to helplines for those who need help in their marriages."</p></blockquote>
The Lord Chancellor continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Marriage counselling is very important. But it will not suit everyone, and the Government wants to ensure—for example, in relation to the powers given to the Lord Chancellor in respect of marriage support in the Family Law Bill—that organisations can be funded as necessary to meet a range of needs — I believe that a reformed law of divorce will 'assist in saving those marriages which have not irretrievably broken down, by providing couples with both the information and time to consider whether or not their marriage can be saved."</p></blockquote>
I want to refer to a further two short passages when the Lord Chancellor said:
<br><blockquote><p>"What the Government is doing through the Family Law Bill and through the working party is giving services the opportunity to prove what we all hope can be achieved through marriage support services—namely that marriages can be saved and family relationships improved."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government can, however, set out a clear message in its legislation that marriage is important and valued."</p></blockquote>
I have quoted at length from that speech. I know that it may have been rather tedious for the hon. Member for Brent, South, who listened to the original, but it is astonishing that the Lord Chancellor should spend so much time dealing with marriage counselling in that very important speech about the Bill and its repercussions. Yet we are now arguing at length about whether there should be even a small mention of the important issue of counselling in the Bill. I have no compunction about supporting amendments to that end because they are right. The Bill will be deficient without them, which is the most important reason for supporting those well intentioned and practicable amendments.<br><br>
Often, in Committee, we argue about matters that are esoteric, academic or even impracticable. But if the amendments could save even 5 per cent. of the marriages that are now in trouble, I believe that they would be worthwhile. I honestly and sincerely believe that the amendments are important and should be agreed to. If they are not accepted, we shall be failing in our duty to better the Bill by introducing guidance and counselling at a very important stage.<br><br>
I have one caveat. I accept that it will be impossible to bring warring parties together to a joint counselling meeting, but there is provision for joint and separate meetings. I strongly support the amendments and hope that the Committee will do likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rising to support the amendments to clause 8, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not; he is rising to support the amendments to clause 6.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But we are discussing those amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that, but we are debating clause 6. We shall vote on those amendments at a later stage, so the hon. Gentleman should direct his remarks to this clause. He can make a passing reference to clause 8, as his hon. Friend did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Patrick. May I clarify the direction from the Chair? I understand that we are debating the lead amendment moved by the hon. Member for Brent, South. However, I noted that three of the amendments to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle referred—amendments Nos. 89, 92 and 94—are all marshalled with amendments to this clause for the purposes of debate. I had intended to refer to those amendments in detail, so it would be helpful to have some guidance from the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Minister may make reference to them, as did the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. Detailed debate should be directed to clause 6. When we come to clause 8, we can deal in detail with its provisions. The marshalling is because the amendments refer to issues that are common to both clauses.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray <span class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Patrick. When we get to clause 8, will those three amendments be debatable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are, of course, debatable. They will be voted on when we reach clause 8. Those three amendments can also be referred to now. In so far, as the matters with which they deal are common to both clauses, they can of course be mentioned in our current debate. We do not want an untidy debate, so we shall debate clause 8 properly when we get to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Patrick. It could cause confusion if we referred to the topic of counselling now, as reflected in the amendments. Several clauses refer to the issue—clauses 8, 21 and a number of others—so we cannot have the same debate four or five times over during the course of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course we cannot. Nobody is suggesting that we can or should. My point was to emphasise that we debate the detail of clause 8 when we get to clause 8. Matters that are common to clause 6 and clause 8 can be touched upon in our current debate. That is why the amendments are marshalled together in a group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle in respect of everything that he said. It is fair to say that the various amendments grouped together cover common ground. My hon. Friend rightly started by paying tribute to the hon. Member for Brent, South for initiating the debate. I should like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend, too, for the way in which he conducted negotiations with the Minister. My hon. Friend the Minister has been exemplary in his willingness to listen to us. We already have the makings of a substantial improvement to an important part of the Bill.<br><br>
I wish to deal with three points relating to my hon. Friend's amendments—re-establishing a three-month delay, establishing a neutral point for information and making legal aid available for marriage guidance counselling. The first is in many ways the most important because the re-establishing of a three-month delay in the process is, in a sense, setting the law back to where it is now. Under current arrangements for a decree nisi, it takes around three months before the parties are firmly caught in the legal apparatus. The mechanism of divorce is more important than the piece of paper stating that someone is divorced. We shall return to that matter later when we get to schedule 2.<br><br>
The three-month period proposed by my hon. Friend would ensure that thousands of people who file for divorce each year and change their mind still have a pause for thought. Without the amendments, parties could in principle—after the row on a Saturday night to which the hon. Member for Heeley referred—ensnare couples in the legal apparatus in a matter of days. It could be very difficult for couples to extricate themselves from that. In some circumstances, property orders could be implemented very quickly—especially when both parties agree—and the family home broken up. Then divorce is already there in all but name.<br><br>
The first of the three reasons why I strongly commend the amendment of my hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is that it would re-establish the three-month delay. I would like it to be longer, but three months is the present requirement.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The second reason is that, as my hon. Friend explained so eloquently, his proposal would provide a neutral point of information. Like him, I have had discussions with some of the counselling agencies, including Marriage Care. Marriage Care is very clear: its resources are limited and it has a policy of using only volunteers, despite the fact that it is the only counselling agency whose counsellors all have a recognised academic qualification. Volunteers are a limited commodity and if large numbers of people genuinely did not want to come through the organisation's doors, it would face serious resourcing consequences. In 5 per cent. or 10 per cent.—I would love to be optimistic enough to say 15 per cent.—of cases there is a real prospect of saving the marriage. If people were forced to go to a counselling agency, they might be put off going voluntarily.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend and some Opposition Members, I am deeply concerned about the suggestion that an information session could be merely a video. We must avoid the scenario that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) mentioned, in which the first visit is to a practitioner who behaves professionally and fairly, but none the less has a stake in the breakdown of the marriage. A mediator is neutral in a way that a solicitor is not, but he is still part of the divorce process. His job is to mediate a civilised breakdown in a marriage. It is essential that the first visit should be not to a solicitor or a mediator, but to someone who is wholly neutral and who will say, "Have you thought about the counselling option"? That is the second merit of my hon. Friend's amendment.<br><br>
My third and final point relates to Government funding based on criteria similar to the legal aid criteria for those who would like a trial session of marriage counselling. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle rightly pointed out that the legal cost of divorce, which runs into hundreds of millions of pounds, is a small part of the total price that society pays for divorce. The true cost of divorce is not just the human misery that it causes, but the burden that it places on society—it costs billions of pounds, and each time we seek information the estimate goes up. I cannot commend too strongly the idea of providing a relatively small sum of money to fund at least the first counselling session to try to save some marriages. That is another merit in my hon. Friend's amendments.<br><br>
For those reasons, I am delighted to support my hon. Friend's amendments. I am grateful to the Minister for the considerable time and trouble that he has taken in discussing in detail how this proposal could work and for the excellent hearing he has given us on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, like every other hon. Member who has spoken in this debate, support this group of amendments. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the points we have made. We share common ground: we believe that if counselling is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
have any effect, it has to be given at an early stage in the process that could eventually lead to divorce. It is worth asking at what stage it should be given, because that affects the nature of the counselling process. The present proposal is that it should come before the statement but after the information meeting. Presumably, any counselling that takes place before the information meeting does not count as such under the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Patrick. Could the hon. Gentleman possibly be asked to speak up? I am concerned to hear his remarks, but I cannot hear him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Motherwell, South heard that and will accede to the hon. Gentleman's request.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best. If the counselling is to take place at an earlier stage, when will that be? Should it be before there is any question of a divorce? Does marriage counselling have a part to play in the course of an untroubled or unbroken marriage? If so, it might be expected to begin during preparation for marriage and subsequently used to strengthen the marriage during crises—although not only then. By the time a couple gets into difficulties and considers divorce, therefore, counselling will not be an alien concept.<br><br>
Is it inconceivable that that approach to counselling could become the norm? Given the endemic plague of psychoanalysis and counselling therapies in the States, it seems that many people freely undertake voluntary processes and find them helpful. There is no legal requirement in those cases.<br><br>
If we are thinking about counselling as a continuing process, we should ask whether the Bill should provide for counselling to precede the statement. Such counselling would qualify for consideration under the amendments. I merely raise that as a possibility—my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South said that it was not practicable because the information meeting was needed to trigger the legal process and that anything that came before would not count. That might be so, but the principle deserves consideration.<br><br>
Whether counselling is undertaken at an early stage—when both partners' minds are genuinely open—or at a later stage, we must ask what its objectives should be. The Bill talks simply of saving the marriage. The amendment's greatest effect would not be the saving of 5 per cent. of marriages; rather, they would slow down the process by which couples end up seeking divorce by preventing the deterioration of marriages. Is that realistic? I mentioned some research on Second Reading, although people have not commented on it. It presented demographic evidence that people who got married when debate about divorce was vigorous and widely followed in the community—that has happened a few times—are more liable to end up in divorce courts than people who were married a year or two before or after.<br><br>
It is a curious demographic fact that the vulnerability to divorce persists throughout life—it persists among people who get divorced after five years or after 30 or 40 years. That hard evidence reflects the fact that people's attitude to a marriage is conditioned to some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
extent by the undertaking that they thought they were making when they married. If so, we can and should build on that fact. Before we consider that, we must ask what view of marriage underlies the Bill. Plainly, it is not that marriage is just a contract: if that were the view, we should be required to look at the terms of the contract that had been undertaken. A large part of the negotiation of any contract relates to the conditions under which it will be terminated. That is not part of the way we view marriage proceedings today.<br><br>
However, if marriage is not just a contract, what is it? If it is the creation of a new social unit, what is the nature of that unit? With that kind of commitment is marriage made? Society has widely differing views about those questions. Attitudes among the constituents with whom I have talked about various marriage and divorce problems over the years also vary widely. But, like lawyers, Members of Parliament tend to be misled, as the people that we see in our surgeries and offices are not representative of the population as a whole, which holds very diverse views on the nature of marriage.<br><br>
The law cannot accommodate all those differences of view. The law has to take a single view, and one is forced to wonder at what stage in the process the differing views in society can be declared and worked out. I think that the law can give the development of different views of marriage some support as part of the process of marriage counselling.<br><br>
The amendments in this group include some that define what is meant by the term "marriage counselling". Amendment No. 12 defines a "marriage counsellor" as
<br><blockquote><p>"a person, approved by the Lord Chancellor, qualified to help effect a reconciliation."</p></blockquote>
That definition contrasts with the definition in amendment No. 14 of the term "mediation", which makes it clear that the Lord Chancellor approves not the individual mediator but the organisation that recognises the mediator.<br><br>
It is plainly impractical for the Lord Chancellor to approve individual marriage counsellors. He would have to have some organisation or structure by which he could fulfil the requirements of amendment No. 12. The obvious candidates would be counselling organisations of some kind, which would resemble the organisations concerned with mediation.<br><br>
If the Lord Chancellor is going to recognise different counselling organisations, each organisation will be able to put forward specific views about the nature of marriage and about the matters to be considered in the divorce process. People will be left to choose which organisation they prefer as the source from which to seek counselling. Their choice will then become part of the folklore of their extended families and communities. Popular public attitudes will react according to whether a particular counselling organisation is appreciated—whether it gives real support and shows real understanding—or whether it is a pain in the neck and provides a discipline with which people feel uncomfortable,<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
It is much more likely that counselling organisations will acquire a reputation and develop a role that is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
acceptable and helpful if they have been involved at an early stage in preparation for and the strengthening of marriage during crises—after the style of the former Marriage Guidance Council. No counselling organisation is currently set up to provide the range of activities that could sustain a nationwide counselling role or take on the task of being the forum within which public attitudes to marriage evolve. No organisation has shown the necessary stability, organisational strength and so on simply because it has not had sufficient resources or the statutory framework within which to develop its activities.<br><br>
I envisage counselling organisations developing into the main means by which public attitudes to both marriage and divorce develop. Where does that leave us in relation to the amendments? If counselling is to be encouraged to develop and the counselling organisation encouraged to function in a way that keeps in touch with people during their lives, there needs to be provision for counselling before the information meeting takes place.<br><br>
The period of just 28 days that the hon. Member for Brent, South anticipates for counselling before a statement is submitted is too brief for any effective counselling to take place—certainly counselling that starts from the point at which a couple have not made up their minds to seek divorce, where their minds are genuinely open and where they have not undertaken counselling simply as the first stage in the divorce process. I have sympathy with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, which specifies a period of three months, but I do not take a dogmatic view on the matter.<br><br>
We need a definition of marriage counsellors that recognises that a counsellor is a person qualified to help people to strengthen a marriage or to effect a reconciliation. If we were to go that far, that would help to create the structure within which marriage counselling organisations could develop constructively within the broad framework of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Lester <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see this amendment as a fall back position. As I said in our previous sitting, for many people the process of divorce is a long one. Marriages break down over a long period and during that time one or other party can seek counselling and other means of support. Not every case involves a quick, ill-considered arrival at a solicitor's office—such cases are in the minority. In most cases, the process is long and drawn out and counselling may have happened before people go to see a solicitor. The Bill deals with the sort of divorce that concerns us all and brings us problems in our surgeries—the quickie, ill-considered divorce that goes through in a short time without consideration having been given to all that goes with it. In the sense that counselling might help to close the door for those who may be in that situation, it is worth while, but we should not see it as the great saviour as marriage or part of the saving process. Those who want to save a marriage probably do most of the work before that stage is reached.<br><br>
I wish to make three points. First, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
Horncastle that marriage counselling must be voluntary. It cannot be made compulsory as that would simply make it a process that is not sought by either party and that will not assist in reconciliation. If counselling is voluntary, people will attend meetings with half a mind to listen to what they are told. They will seek help, instead of simply going through the process to obtain the necessary coverage.<br><br>
Secondly, the proposal would add a great deal to the process of counselling. I agree that the quality of counselling must have some definition. We must also bear in mind the geographical range as we do not want the same system that applies to other social measures—when counselling and how well it is carried out depends on where a person lives. Thirdly, such a service must be funded so that it does not have to depend on the voluntary sector.<br><br>
I support what the hon Member for Brent, South said earlier. The opposition tabled amendments advocating a period for reflection of 12 months. Subsequently, the House decided that it should be 18 months. I do not want the period to become 21 months as a matter of course for the 90 to 95 per cent. of divorces that will not be affected by an additional three months. The 18-month period decided by the House should remain at 18 months and not become 21 months, which would create additional tensions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If marriage counselling takes place before the information meeting when neither party had made a firm decision to seek a divorce, that could not, strictly speaking, be counted as an additional three months or 28 days on top of the period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The way that I read the amendment and the way in which the hon. Member for Brent, South perceived it was that the period would be an additional three months before a statement could be made, from which the 12-month period or the 18-month period would begin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is because the amendment proposes that counselling would take place after the information meeting. In fact, it could take place before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My remarks are intended as a pointer, because we are anxious to make the Bill equitable to all parties. We do not want to create time hurdles for the 90 to 95 per cent. of divorces which, as I have already described, have come to the end of a long road of disintegration. We are not talking about quickie divorces or the 12-month reflection period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important and interesting debate and I have been struck by the consensus in the Committee. There may have been some differences in the approach to the matter but, in general, the principle behind the debate is shared. The hon. Members for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for Gainsborough and Horncastle praised the Minister for his willingness to listen to the debate, which is in contrast with the earlier comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) who said that the Minister was being combative. I hope that the Minister has heard the consensus in and depth of our debate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
I associate myself with all those who have spoken in support of the amendments. Not one voice has yet been raised against them. They are important because they write counselling and reconciliation firmly into the Bill. At the moment, only one mention is made of marriage counselling and other support services—in clause 8, which suggests that the information session should be a signposting towards marriage counselling.<br><br>
The amendments define and give focus to the process of reconciliation. They fit extremely well with clause 1(b), which states that
<br><blockquote><p>"the parties to a marriage which may have broken down are to be encouraged to take all practicable steps to save it".</p></blockquote>
The important word is "all", which must include at least considering reconciliation and conciliation. It has been said that we cannot legislate to make people do things, but the Bill does precisely that—before a statement can be given, the parties have to attend an information session. The Bill sets out a clear framework for that.<br><br>
One of the attractions of the amendments is that they clarify what is for me something of a black hole about information sessions. We shall come to that matter in clause 8—I realise that the two clauses are linked—but I am not sure what an information session is. It seems that people could be herded into a room and addressed from the front or be given leaflets. The Law Society has spoken of producing a video. It is not clear what information sessions will be like. Although clause 8 provides that people will be directed to counselling and marriage support sessions, that is merely a signpost; there is little direction to that provision. More emphasis should be given to reconciliation.<br><br>
Statistics point to the fact that many of those who have been divorced, if not the majority, subsequently regret it. The figures suggest that 51 per cent. of divorced men and 29 per cent. of divorced women regret having divorced. A direction that people should attend a counselling session at least takes the foot off the accelerator and puts it on the brake for a short time. The vehicle taking people towards divorce can be put into free-wheel for a while to allow some double checking.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
One group with a particular interest in reconciliation is children. Before I came to the House, I acted at times as a guardian ad litem. I spent a great deal of time talking to children whose parents affairs were before the courts, trying to explore with those children what they wanted for the future. Almost without exception —although there are a few—if children could have their wish or wave a magic wand, they would want their parents to be reconciled and to stay together in the marriage. Later in the Bill we will discuss the views of children. It is important that their voice should be heard. The amendments provide an opportunity for us to say to parents that reconcilation must be considered.<br><br>
We cannot force people into a counselling process. The amendments take matters forward from the information session, which people must attend, to a counselling session. The counselling options would be made available to one or both parties, but it is a matter for them. As has been said during the debate, we cannot force people into counselling. I simply want them to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
think about it and weigh it in the balance. My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray) made the important point that the earlier that happens—before real breakdown occurs—the better. It would be helpful if we could extend counselling to the period before marriage, when relationships start.<br><br>
If people decide not to go through the process of counselling, it would still be helpful for them to have the opportunity to take stock of their marriage and talk to a counsellor. So often, when people are in trouble and have had a chance to talk they say, "I feel better for that." The session would provide an opportunity to take the heat out of the system. People might not go for counselling to save the marriage, but they could have personal counselling to take the hurt out of an extremely stressful situation.<br><br>
The only divergence in the Committee so far has centred on the stage at which counselling should take place. Should it occur before the information session, as has been argued, or within four weeks of a statement being made, or within three months? We are discussing a relatively short period. The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Sir J. Lester) was right to say that the House has decided on a period for reflection of 18 months. We must be careful not to extend that period too far, but we must also be careful to ensure that we do the job properly.<br><br>
It was said this morning that the Bill would create a new industry or give greater importance to the work of counsellors and mediators. That will happen and we should start planning for it now. The Bill reminds me of the establishment of the Child Support Agency. It is an important piece of legislation which, in my view, has not attracted sufficient attention. I am surprised at how little thought and discussion have been devoted to the Bill, apart from one or two contentious aspects of it. If we back-track to the debates on the CSA, we find exactly that there, too.<br><br>
I worry that in two years' time we will not have done the necessary preparation work. We should be training counsellors and examining best practice and new techniques now. I know that the Bill gives us the opportunity to do that, but we need to get on with it and put the pieces in place before we end up with another disaster like the CSA.<br><br>
The Bill entails a major switch in social policy, and all such switches cost more in the short term. There may be long-term savings, such as in the legal aid budget, but there may be a step-ladder effect—to save money later we must spend money now. I hope that there will be resources for the preparation and training of counsellors and the grant-aiding of bodies such as Relate and other marriage guidance organisations, which are often associated with churches.<br><br>
It is clear to me that the breakdown of marriages costs society not only in terms of the insecurity that we have discussed, but in extra benefits and so on. The figure of £3.4 billion has been mentioned, although I am sceptical about that. It is hard to put a figure on it. Nevertheless, there are real costs as well as real savings that could be made, enabling us both to strengthen the social fabric and to reduce public expenditure.<br><br>
If the Committee agrees to the amendments, what can we expect? I do not believe that there will be many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
salvations and that many marriages will be saved, although I note that during separation periods and divorce proceedings 20,000 to 30,000 people change their minds. The amendments would put a foot on the brake and be a signpost to people saying, "You must consider whether your marriage can be saved and whether you can be reconciled." If we can save some marriages, the expenditure—however great or small—will be important in improving society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During this debate we have heard a great deal from both Conservative and Opposition Members who want to promote marriage counselling. When we discussed the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle to incorporate marriage counselling in clause 1, there was universal support for the concept of promoting marriage counselling in the Bill.<br><br>
In response to some of the criticisms levelled by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, I would argue that the very introduction of the Bill does a great deal to promote the idea of marriage counselling. I do not expect great support from my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, but it is helpful that the Bill will do away with grounds for divorce that are based on throwing about allegations of fault.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is likely to be more supportive of some of the other proposals that I have made, including the introduction, for the first time, of a period for reflection and consideration. However long that period may be, the concept contributes towards saving marriages that are capable of being saved. Much has been said about the number of occasions on which petitions for divorce are filed but are not, for one reason or another, proceeded with. We should consider that against the background of the median time for divorces is seven months, the period for reflection and consideration is necessarily greater.<br><br>
The concept of that period is entirely new. I am not aware of any other jurisdiction in which there is such a requirement. We have heard much about the experience of Australia and New Zealand, but the grounds for divorce in those countries require people to live apart for certain periods before they can file for divorce. The Bill introduces a novel concept—a period for reflection and consideration—that will help marriage counselling. Furthermore, there is the concept of compulsory attendance at an information meeting.<br><br>
As has been said, one of the advantages of information meetings is that the marriage support services available will be spelt out to people. Lawyers are required to do that but, lo and behold, only one in four people can remember having been told by their lawyer of the availability of marriage support services. I am not saying that that is a failure on the part of lawyers, but it highlights the need to ensure that people are made aware of the availability of those services.<br><br>
In due course—given your earlier strictures, Sir Patrick, I hesitate to say too much—we shall consider the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
Gainsborough and Horncastle that would encourage people to take advantage of such services. Furthermore, seeking to resolve matters of finance, property and the children through mediation helps us to promote the saving of saveable marriages because the context and atmosphere of that process is bound to be better than that which is often found in the conflicts of the current system. Let it not be argued that the Bill does nothing to promote marriage support; it does a great deal.<br><br>
In a speech to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred, my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor said that still more needs to be done. That is one of the reasons that the Government has set up a working party on marriage. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Motherwell, South said that marriage support services should operate before the crisis point—when someone takes advice about whether to divorce. That is the context for the Lord Chancellor's working group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all well aware—an example has been given this afternoon—of the statements that the Lord Chancellor and the Minister have made on reconciliation and saving marriages that can be saved, but we have seen no practical proposals from the Department on how that might be done. We constantly hear references to what is in the Bill. However, although the Government have conceded that reconciliation is important, they have not proposed positive amendments. Is not that deplorable? Why must we wait so long?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to repeat to the hon. Gentleman the information that I have just given to the Committee. The Bill is constructed to support marriage. I recognise the concerns that have been expressed during the debate. Therefore, in order to find a way forward, I propose to outline the propositions that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and the hon. Member for Brent, South have put forward—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All hon. Members would have saved considerable time, effort and energy if the Minister had put forward his practical proposals before now. Why was it necessary for this group of amendments to be tabled? Why did not the Minister table his own amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should restrain himself. I must disappoint him by saying that I have not been persuaded to support his amendment. The debate has highlighted the fact that we must be realistic in seeking to promote marriage counselling. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe was right to say that we are desperate to do all that we can to save saveable marriages. However, the notion that we can build into the Bill a mechanism that will transform parties seeking divorce into parties seeking reconciliation is unrealistic. We must therefore find ways of identifying the limited number of cases in which that may be a realistic prospect and help them to save their marriage.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: While all that my hon. Friend says is true, does he agree that it would help
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
immensely if there were a clearer differentiation between the benefits of being married and of living in some other relationship? Over the years we have steadily undermined the benefits of marriage. When people are contemplating whether to try to patch up a relationship the material benefits of being married form a minor but important element in their consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of benefits to marriage, as we heard during the wide-ranging Second Reading debate. I shall not detain the Committee with my views about the importance of my own marriage; all of us who have been blessed with happy marriages recognise their importance. The point of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) relates more to the financial benefits of marriage—I shall take that as the first budget submission that has been made to me this year.<br><br>
It is important that, as the hon. Member for Motherwell, South said, marriage counselling should not be seen as part of the divorce process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister no doubt knows that divorce lawyers have always had a duty to discuss reconciliation with their clients. The Lord Chancellor, in the speech to which I referred earlier, said that lawyers will now have to sign a certificate to confirm that that has been done. Reconciliation and/or counselling are not part of the divorce machine, but hurdles that must be faced before divorce proceedings are reached. No one is arguing that reconciliation is part and parcel of the divorce machine; rather, it is an opportunity, albeit at a late stage and distinct from the divorce procedure, to reflect on and reconsider the possibility of mending things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is where I take issue with the hon. Gentleman's points. I am surprised by his argument that a visit to a marriage counsellor should be viewed as a hurdle to be cleared in the divorce process. Those who argued on Second Reading for a lengthier period for reflection and consideration made their case forcefully. I made it clear then that I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, believed that a 12-month period was appropriate. We also heard arguments that increasing the period to 18 months would allow more time for reconciliation to be considered. We should not incorporate into the process the idea that seeing a marriage counsellor is a hurdle that must be cleared at an early stage. I want people to keep alive, throughout the processs, the possibility of seeing a marriage counsellor thereby keeping alive the possibility of achieving a reconciliation. That is one of the reasons why the mediators duties have been codified; it ensures that such sessions, as well as information sessions, are included in the process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should withdraw my reference to a hurdle—I did not mean an obstacle, but an opportunity to discuss, even at a late stage, the repairing of a marriage. More importantly, the further down the road of divorce proceedings one goes, the less the likelihood of reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not challenge the hon. Gentleman's new terminology. I am anxious that people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
should have the opportunity to take advantage of marriage counselling. There is, however, a genuine difference across the Committee, which was clear in the speeches that we have heard. The hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) said that the only difference that he saw between us was on the timing of marriage counselling. In fact, the difference was over whether attendance with a marriage counsellor should be made a compulsory part of the process. I did not hear any speeches from my hon. Friends that argued for marriage counselling to be compulsory, but most Opposition Members argued in favour of compulsion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would help me better to understand the Minister's attitude if he could tell us the scope of the working party on marriage, which the Lord Chancellor has set up. Is it, for example, considering any variation in the undertakings that are given by couples who marry in register offices? At the moment, they contain no long-term commitment. A development in that area would in turn introduce a requirement to explain what those undertakings were, which would be another opening to marriage counselling in a statutory framework.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman—although I am trying to remain in order and speak to the amendments—by saying that I am aware of what the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster said recently in relation to the specific point that the hon. Gentleman has raised. It is clear, therefore, that consideration is bound to be given to a response to the Cardinal Archbishop's point.<br><br>
The seminar and the working party have been set up to draw together those Government Departments that have a responsibility in this area and to set an agenda to ensure that more is done to support marriage. Clearly, that activity parallels the steps that we are arguing for in the Bill. I think that there is universality across the Committee on that.<br><br>
I come now to the specific proposals. The first concerns the introduction of what has been described as a cooling-off period—in other words, a period after attendance at the information meeting but before a statement of marital breakdown can be served. We have two further proposals in relation to that. The first has been put forward by the hon. Member for Brent, South. He argues that there should be a period of 28 days—that must surely be a minimum—but that period could be, I presume, two months, or even, depending on the way in which the prescribed circumstances of exemptions might apply, lengthier than that, I do not know. Certainly, there would be an indeterminate period of between 28 days and two months following attendance at an information meeting during which a statement of marital breakdown could not be filed.<br><br>
The alternative, which has been put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, is rather more certain in scope. He proposes a specific period of three months. In those circumstances, we must first address whether there should be a gap in time following attendance at the information meeting but before filing a notice of marital breakdown.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
After reflection, I am persuaded by the argument that if the information meeting is to serve its purpose, there must be time during which the information that has been provided is taken on board. From time to time it has been argued that someone could file a statement of marital breakdown within a day of attending the information meeting. In those circumstances, one wonders whether the information provided has had sufficient time to affect the judgments made by the person who files the statement. Therefore, to have a period after the information meeting seems to be an advance and I am persuaded by the arguments that have been presented in favour of such a period.<br><br>
The next judgment is whether to have an indeterminate period with a compulsory requirement to attend a marriage counsellor, or to accept the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. As the Committee will have gathered, I am not persuaded that requiring a compulsory meeting with a marriage counsellor will be helpful. In my view, counselling will not work if it is compulsory. Even the hon. Member for Brent, South argued that. When he outlined his proposal, he suggested that it did not advocate compulsory counselling, as some of his critics in the press had claimed. He said that it was merely an opportunity or a pathway to marriage guidance. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle also proposed pathways to marriage guidance, but his pathways depend on people's voluntary choices. I am bound to say that it is more likely that such a route would prove successful than would a compulsory requirement.<br><br>
Compulsory counselling would also divert what might well be valuable marriage counselling resources. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury referred to his meeting with Marriage Care, which is the Catholic marriage guidance council. That organisation contacted me to outline what it considers would be the enormous resource implications of the proposal put forward by the hon. Member for Brent, South. It claims that those implications could skew the provision of marriage counselling. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our experience shows that counselling at the point when one party is considering divorce is less effective in helping to save marriage than if the intervention takes place earlier in the marriage."</p></blockquote>
That is the very point, made with force, by the hon. Member for Motherwell, South and I agree. Resources having to be applied irrespective of the wishes of the individuals represents a hurdle—even though now withdrawn—in the process. Although I accept that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has withdrawn his remarks, compulsory counselling would be considered a hurdle in the process by the people who would be required by the legislation to undertake it. In the circumstances, I am not attracted to the concept of compulsory counselling.<br><br>
At the same time, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and others urged that we encourage individuals to take advantage of what is available in terms of marriage support services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The representations by the Catholic marriage guidance council seem to be cast in a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
framework where only the present resources can be put into marriage counselling. That could be skewed. We can realistically discuss counselling only if resources are increased. Surely, if counselling is required at or around the time of divorces, that should be taken into account without starving counselling at other stages of marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to say a word in relation to resources before I sit down, not least because my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has tabled amendment No. 94 on that subject. Whatever resources there might be, it is surely an attractive argument that resources be applied where they are likely to have the best effect. To direct all resources towards the latter part of the process and few to the earlier part runs against the very point made with some force by the hon. Member for Motherwell, South on Second Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point appears persuasive, but the Minister should reflect that in medicine, although much the most effective expenditure goes on prevention, that does not mean that all serious surgery and physical medicine can be closed down. Prevention must be additional to those.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I anticipate that resources must be available at all points. If, as the Marriage Care organisation spelt out, resources were diverted towards the provision of a minimum of 165,000 more interviews a year, that would divert skilled resources away from the preventive work that is likely to increase as a result of the Bill. That point is made with some force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to reinforce two other points from Marriage Care which may not appear in that organisation's written brief. First, as I mentioned earlier, the organisation accepts only volunteers as counsellors. It has no paid counsellors, even though each counsellor has a recognised academic qualification. That means that money resources are not the solution to the problem. Marriage Care involves a finite pool of people who are willing to give up their time.<br><br>
The second point would probably be echoed by other marriage guidance organisations. Although all organisations would like to see people who want help with their marriages, there is a possibility, as has been suggested, that they could become just another part of the divorce process, another box that must get ticked. That would detract from the perception that they are outside the process and that people can go and see them voluntarily to seek alternatives.<br><br>
That is why I am persuaded by the idea of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, which is to set up a neutral point from which the information can be obtained. At that point there would be people to advise about the service, but they would not take those in difficulty through the door against their will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was nearly an address to the Committee rather than an intervention on the Minister.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Patrick.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have responded to hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, but he was referring to amendment No. 93, with which I intend to deal later.<br><br>
I have outlined some of my anxieties about the concept of compulsory marriage counselling. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle for the amendments that he has tabled and which he has discussed with me. His proposals would provide for a three-month cooling-off period between attendance at an information meeting and the making of a statement. They further provide that, at the information meeting, the opportunity of meeting with a marriage counsellor would be offered and that the party or parties attending the meeting would be encouraged to take up that offer. However, unlike the amendments tabled by Opposition Members, my hon. Friend's proposals would not compel people to do so.<br><br>
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle provide that information meetings must be conducted by a person who has satisfied certain qualification and training criteria, to be set in regulations, and who has no interest—financial or otherwise—in the parties' marital proceedings. Furthermore, the initial meeting with a marriage counsellor, as a result of the information meeting, would be state funded. For some parties that meeting would therefore be free, but others may have to make a contribution. It is envisaged that the eligibility criteria will be the same for mediation, although marriage counselling cannot be paid for out of the legal aid fund, as the matters being considered by the couple and the counsellor are not justiciable issues.<br><br>
The Government would accept the spirit and the intention behind my hon. Friend's amendments, which would provide additional time for parties to attempt to save their marriage and to receive the support of a qualified person to assist in that process if they so wish. The amendments would strengthen the institution of marriage by providing parties with more time to reflect on the information that they have received, and they would give those parties the opportunity to receive specialist assistance in the attempts to save their marriages. In that context, as I have said, the Government accept the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
However, I must make it clear that the amendments raise a number of practical issues, to which careful consideration must be given. They are important amendments and they will, I believe, enhance the Bill: in that regard I share the view outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. However, we must ensure that they are workable and fully achieve their purpose. After the issues have been considered in consultation with marriage guidance and other organisations, we may need to return to the amendments on Report to ensure that they will operate as my hon. Friend intends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. For clarification, will the Minister make it clear which amendments he intended to accept?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am minded to accept amendments Nos. 89, 91, 92 and 94.<br><br>
The Government have listened carefully to the points raised by those who have contributed to the debate. Conservative Members have drawn to the attention of my noble Friend and myself their wish to ensure that marriage counselling is placed at the heart of the Bill. That objective will be achieved by the amendments proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle.<br><br>
It has been suggested in some quarters—and, indeed, by the hon. Member for Brent, South—that the introduction of a three-month cooling-off period would necessarily lengthen the process to 21 months. However, parties engaged in the process of divorce tend to have taken their first legal advice 12 months or so before initiating the process, so there is no direct correlation between the time at which they first seek advice and the time at which it is decided to start the process of divorce.<br><br>
Even allowing for that fact, some would argue that the Committee of the whole House took the view that the period for reflection and consideration should be 18 months and should not be extended. My hon. Friend the member for Broxtowe certainly took that view. The Government have made it clear, however, that they have no overall view about the appropriate period for reflection and consideration. I expressed my personal view in that regard, on behalf of the Government. The period was decided by the Committee of the whole House—although it was misreported in some quarters as being a Government defeat. In view of the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, some hon. Members may wish to return to the issue on Report. That should be distinguished from the proposal before the Committee today, which is that a period of time should be allotted following the meeting at which the information is taken on board and before a statement of marital breakdown is filed. In that respect, I endorse the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting development in our deliberations. The Minister has held out the spectre—and I hope that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle realises it—of a re-run of the debate on whether there should be a 12, 18 or 24-month period for reflection and consideration. A different configuration of the House may decide that the proper course is to have a 12-month period. With the three months proposed in the amendment, that will amount to 15 months for reflection and consideration—three months less than the current period and five months less than we would have had if the Minister had accepted our amendment. I look forward enormously to the debate on Report.<br><br>
This interesting development shows the extent to which the Government have got themselves into a mess—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Oh yes they have. I have said that time and again, but I know that it is always treated with scepticism by Conservative Members. I do not want to sound churlish. I welcome the Minister's recognition of the importance of including reconciliation in the Bill. That principle has been put into practice—it was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
established in an earlier debate and we now have a practical manifestation of it. There will be a space and time for reconciliation.<br><br>
We are concerned that pathways into counselling should be clearly signposted. The amendments include a means to do that and would ensure that pathways are universally available. That approach has clearly not found favour with the Minister, who has shown some scepticism about it. I should, however, make it clear that counselling was never intended to be compulsory. We propose a mandate to explore the possibility of saving a marriage, and we make no apology for that. It is dangerous to believe—as the Minister and Conservative Members will soon realise—that we can simply use words such as "encouraging". The Minister took us to task earlier for not defining domestic violence, so before there is universal celebration at his concession, we are entitled to ask what he means by "encouragement". I certainly do not know, although perhaps the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, who has had extensive consultation with the Minister, will leap to his feet to tell us.<br><br>
Will there be a special little video to sell the merits of counselling to the parties? Will there be a special leaflet? Will the independent person who is responsible for the information sessions have to express a preference for individuals to attend counselling? The Minister's intentions are not particularly transparent, but the amendments are. People would attend a meeting to explore whether a marriage could be saved and if they say no, that is the end of the matter. At least they will know that they have to go to the meeting and why they are going—it is an opportunity and a window that will be opened. If people choose to go through it, that is a matter for them<br><br>
The Minister spoke about skewing resources and skewing the process. I am interested that he pays lip service to earlier intervention, and I shall pursue the matter with him again and again. He said that he would talk about resources—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Luff <span class='memberconstituency'>(Worcester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: He did so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He did, did he? Perhaps he can tell us now how much intervention will cost—we do not yet know. It depends on the number of people taking up this option. What is the Minister's best estimate? Perhaps a piece of paper will wing its way from officials, but I fear not. I can but ask.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have said that this proposal is likely to apply to the 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of marriages that are saveable—they would bid up to 15 per cent. There is a difference of 300 per cent. between the estimates of Opposition Members, so the hon. Gentleman is hardly in a position to challenge us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle suggested 15 per cent.—or was it the hon. Member for Canterbury? Perhaps he said 5 per cent. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Do I hear 15 per cent. from the hon. Member for Canterbury?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The way in which the debate is being conducted makes it incredibly difficult not only for the Chairman but for the <i>Hansard</i> reporter. I know that we all attach great importance to the accurate reporting of our debates, but that is made very difficult when the poor reporter has to try to pick up these sedentary interventions and on the hoof replies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We take your strictures to heart, Sir Patrick. I ask, pointing to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, is it 15 per cent.? I say, pointing to the hon. Member for Canterbury, is it 5 per cent.? We do not know, but at the end of the day I presume the Government will offer proposals. Let us not forget that the Bill emanates not from the impulse of a private Member—as is usually the case when we explore family law—but from the Government. What research has been done by the Lord Chancellor's Department in this area? Surely we are entitled to ask that question. If emphasis is to be placed on mediation and its availability—I welcome that—how much will it cost?<br><br>
The Minister held up this proposal as an example of how the Bill is committed to reconciliation. If people are to be able to come in and out of the process—into mediation, back into law, back into mediation and from mediation to reconciliation—how much will it cost? How much will one reconciliation session cost? Relate has estimated that if everyone were to receive one counselling session to explore whether a marriage could be saved, it would cost about £5 million. Do the Government have any figures of their own? Have they given any consideration to the costing of their proposals? If they have, now is the time to publish those figures. We have asked them time and again to make those figures known, but they have consistently refused to do so.<br><br>
The Government concede that the Bill should include provisions on reconciliation and that time must be set aside for that purpose. The Government's strategy is to re-open the question of the length of period for reflection and consideration. In the light of their assurances, our position is simple: we shall wait and see. We will see what they produce on Report and we will vote accordingly. We do not intend to push our amendments to the vote. We put the Government on notice that if they do not cost their proposals and make it clear what the practical mechanisms and signposts will be, they cannot rely on our support when this matter returns to the Floor of the House. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

ATTENDANCE AT INFORMATION MEETINGS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 89, in page 5, line 17, after "meeting", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"not less than three months". [<i>Mr. Leigh.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 5, line 17, at end insert—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0094">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Different information meetings must be arranged with respect to different marriages".</p></blockquote>
I can be brief because we have already covered this matter in our previous debate. Amendment No. 90 provides for individual information meetings, which are not mentioned in the Bill. It is important that people who interpret the Bill and those who will be responsible for such meetings realise that the person who is seeking a divorce should come to a meeting either on his or her own or with his or her partner, but not with other partners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle for tabling the amendment. It provides for parties to attend information meetings on an individual basis, rather than as part of a group. We have heard much about the position in Australia, where such meetings are held in group sessions. I have always made it clear that it is the Lord Chancellor's intention to pilot such arrangements. I have certainly taken on board the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and others about the protection of an individual's privacy. The amendment will be a useful addition to the Bill and I am prepared to accept it, subject to the caveat that in order to ensure that it is workable, we may have to do some tidying up on Report.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendments made:</i> 91, in page 5, line 28, after "purpose", insert "—(a)".</p>
<p>No. 92, in page 5, line 30, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) of giving the party or parties attending the information meeting the opportunity of having a meeting with a marriage counsellor and of encouraging that party or those parties to attend that meeting".—[<i>Mr. Leigh.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 5, line 30, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() An information meeting must be conducted by a person who is—
<ol>
<li>qualified and appointed in accordance with prescribed provisions; and</li>
<li>a person who will have no financial or other interest in any marital proceedings between the parties.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Again, I can be brief, Sir Patrick, because of the expert way in which you have allowed us to range over these matters. The amendment relates to a point that I made earlier—and which my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury also made—about requiring the person holding the information meeting to be qualified. My hon. Friend the Minister will have to draw up suitable qualifications in subsequent regulations. Above all, as stressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, the person holding the meeting should not have any financial or personal interest in the divorce process. The amendment is important as it would substantially improve the way in which the information meeting is conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is debatable. I thank the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle for recognising the latitude that I gave earlier. It became clear both to the Clerk and me that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
would have been wise for all the amendments to be marshalled together, which was why I did not intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the intention of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle that the person holding the information meeting could be a divorce lawyer, but should have no financial or other interest in the marital proceedings of the parties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That has to be my intention. Some latitude must be given to the Lord Chancellor and the way in which regulations are drawn up. We do not want to frame the Bill so tightly that it would be almost impossible to find a qualified person capable of holding information meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for tabling the amendment. It rests naturally with his other amendments in respect of the three-month cooling-off period between attending an information meeting and filing a statement and those amendments that would encourage people to attend a meeting with a marriage counsellor.<br><br>
The amendment provides that information meetings must be conducted by a person who has satisfied certain qualification and training criteria, which will be set out in regulations. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for saying that that matter must be dealt with in due course by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The person concerned must have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the parties' marital proceedings.<br><br>
I share my hon. Friend's view that he does not want the person who is undertaking the information meeting to have any interest in directing people down the road to divorce. That would conflict with the duty under the Bill to encourage people to take advantage of marriage counselling. That is the spirit and force of the amendment and, in that context, it is entirely sensible. It would provide the parties with the support of a qualified person to assist them in attempting to save their marriage. The Government are happy to accept the amendment. However, I wish to issue the same caveat that I did in relation to my hon. Friend's earlier amendments to ensure that the amendment is workable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has finished. If the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy wishes to speak, he can do so—but he must stand up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir Patrick. I was about to stand up. I have a bad rugby injury, so I am surprised that you picked on me in that way.<br><br>
What sort of person does the Minister anticipate will chair the information meetings? Will such people be drawn from a particular profession? Who does he foresee carrying out such an important task?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to be limited. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and several other members of the Committee have said that, as currently drawn, the Bill will allow a clerk from the local citizens advice bureau to speak to people. The hon. Member for Sherwood is nodding. He, too, expressed concern about whether the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
parties would merely watch a video. That is not the context of the information meeting that I want. It is important that the person has counselling skills. That is the best way to put it; I do not wish to be more specific. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle was especially keen to ensure that there should be individual meetings and that people have the necessary qualifications and training.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Minister's intention that people should have a choice in the type of information meeting that they attend? Let us suppose that one meeting was chaired by a marriage counsellor while another was chaired by a divorce lawyer—will people be able to choose which to attend?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some people, especially members of the Solicitors Family Law Association, have been training as mediators for some time to ensure that they can offer both mediation and legal services. I am not aware of many lawyers wanting to undertake information meetings. I do not want to be unduly prescriptive. It has always been the Government's view that we want to pilot a number of methods to ensure that we find the best means of conveying information. Additional information may be included alongside that already provided for in the Bill.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
What the Government are conceding for the purposes of this debate is that those conducting information meetings should be trained and should have counselling skills. Beyond that, we are prepared to pilot a number of ways of taking information meetings forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that include allowing choice between counsellors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I have not yet considered the implications of having a series of different information meetings from which people could be invited to select. That is an interesting proposition to which I would not want to commit myself at this stage, although it is something that may arise from the piloting to which I referred.<br><br>
What I found surprising about this debate is that when I have shown flexibility I have been asked to provide costings for every specific aspect; I am now being asked to respond to what may be a variety of schemes that will emerge from pilots. I have responded to the concern raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle that the people undertaking information meetings should have appropriate training and counselling skills. I am certainly prepared to concede that that is necessary. Beyond that, the Government stand where they have always stood—information meetings must be delivered through a number of pilots before we alight on one specific method.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome what my hon. Friend the Minister has said about pilots. I know that the National Association of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
Family Mediation and Conciliation Services is glad that pilots are to be run. However, I warn against the idea that training is all that matters. Reference was made in this morning's newspapers to a tragic, unrelated case in which a 20-year-old was a bereavement counsellor. A 20-year-old, whatever training he or she may have had, is not capable of doing such work. An experienced person who is twice as old but who has had less training would be more effective.<br><br>
It is important that a range of options is available. Cultural, religious, ethnic backgrounds and other factors matter. People should be able to feel at home with the information they receive and the people from whom they receive it. I recommend the briefing note from National Family Mediation. Now is not the time to go into great detail about its suggestions, but the information, the people and the place are all important because we want to provide information that is useful to people, rather than a hoop that they must go through either to save or to destroy a marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little edgy about concentrating on qualifications. There are two distinct functions, one of which is to provide information. There is a tremendous need—especially when people are in emotional turmoil—for factual information about costs, effects and so on. That can be perfectly well provided by the sort of people who so admirably staff our citizens advice bureaux around the country, with the amazing backup provided by the notes that they are given. Such meetings may frequently lead someone to say, "I would like some counselling". At that point, the door should be thrown wide open to someone who is a qualified counsellor.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we move on, may I point out to the Committee that the next two amendments, which have been selected to be debated separately, deal with specific—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Patrick. Are you going to call amendment No. 94?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must take the amendments in the order in which they appear on the amendment paper. Amendment No. 94 will be called formally at the appropriate time. We are now going to discuss amendment No. I. That and amendment No. 2, which have been selected for separate debates, deal with very specific points. I ask the Committee to bear that in mind as we debate these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 5, line 38, after "apply", insert "; and—
<br><blockquote><p>(d) about the provision of information in relevant languages, and in circumstances which make such information accessible to person taking into account their cultural and religious requirements.".</p></blockquote>
I take your strictures seriously, Sir Patrick. I will speak about the specifics of the amendment, but I shall deal first with clause 8 and the relevance of the amendment to it.<br><br>
I appreciate what the Minister said earlier about flexibility, but as we have pointed out, this is an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
extremely unusual Bill. We are discussing and agreeing to clauses without knowing what their practical effect will be. The Minister said that a number of pilot projects would take place. We are discussing information meetings, a new concept in divorce law. Various questions arise concerning the provision of information meetings.<br><br>
The Minister says, with a hint of hurt or reproach, that each time he talks about pilot projects, we ask him for costings. That is entirely pertinent to the Bill. From the outset, the Government have said that it is revenue neutral. They have mentioned several pilot projects, but we have no idea what form they will take and what the cost implications will be. We do not know which the favoured pilot project will be and what it will cost. We make no apology for continuing to put the Government on the spot about the content and cost of information meetings and pilot projects.<br><br>
I hope that before we reach the end of our consideration of the clause, we will receive detailed information about the pilot projects. Where will they take place? When will the first ones be up and running? Will they be held in different parts of the country, and should we look for regional variations? What are their cost implications? Will some be low-cost and others higher-cost? What will be the mechanism for evaluating them? That will be extremely important.<br><br>
We must make sure that the pilot projects are relevant to Britain, with our multicultural, multiracial society. Amendment No. 1 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of information in relevant languages, and in circumstances which make such information accessible to persons taking into account their cultural and religious requirements."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
My constituency of Hornsey and Wood Green is in the borough of Haringey, where more than 140 languages are spoken. If the Bill is to be successful, provisions must be made for those different cultures to have a voice at information meetings, and for the information to be relevant. If it cannot be translated to fit in with those different languages, cultures and various religious traditions, we shall find ourselves in a complete and utter shambles—for which the Government will have to take full responsibility.<br><br>
It is not merely a question of language and translation, important as that is. We must also respect different cultures and traditions. It is therefore important that the pilot projects take account of differences in culture and religious tradition that might make it difficult for some people—perhaps we should think of women in that context—to attend information meetings. We need to know how that will be dealt with. That is why it is important to continue to press the Minister about the form and content of the information meeting and on the form of the pilot projects. We must take account of the multiracial society that we are proud to live in.<br><br>
I look forward to the Minister's reply. I hope to gain some reassurance that he has thought the matter through, that the Lord Chancellor's Department has considered the amendment in detail, and that he has considered how the pilot projects will operate.</span></p>
