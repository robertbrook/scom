	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 77 sets out the two accounting methods that the Government will use as the basis for future taxation of loan relationships. My concern about how they have dealt with that is already apparent, and I am particularly concerned about clause 77.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Thursday, we considered amendments to clause 76 and schedule 8. No sooner had I returned to my office, than I discovered a lengthy letter on my desk from Freshfields, the prominent firm of solicitors, which deals with taxation. It expressed great concerns about aspects of schedule 8. I shall not rehearse those now because we have dealt with them already, but they apply equally to clause 77.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had representations not only from Freshfields, but from Vauxhall Motors Ltd. and others who are concerned about the issues with which we have already dealt. I should have thought that not only the Opposition, but the Government would want to take note of and respond to many of the points that those organisations raised in their correspondence. Few political issues are involved here—we simply need to get matters right. It was unfortunate, therefore, that the Government were unable to take account of input from those organisations—indeed, Freshfields described the way in which we had handled matters as
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
a perversion of the parliamentary process. That is a strong phrase for a firm of solicitors to use, but it is obviously heartfelt. We should, therefore, move through the clauses with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already received representations from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Taxation about the different accounting methods that are being used. Their views differ slightly, although they are not so different from those of many members of the Committee. They think that the thrust of the reform is good and welcomed the consultation as far as it went, although they thought that it was insufficient. Problems have arisen because of the rush to introduce the measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An accruals or mark-to-market basis might be too restrictive for dealing adequately with the accounts. Will the Minister set out in his reply the arguments for allowing those types of account to be used for calculating taxation? It may be surprising but I have much more sympathy for the Government than those organisations do: there is a need for clarity about the basis on which accounts should be assessed. To have two systems is prima facie a good idea but difficulties can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the lack of consultation and the Labour party's response to it. It will be noticed that we have not tabled any amendments to this part of the Bill. That has been a deliberate policy for various reasons. First, it is not a party political matter and there are few ideological differences between us on the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have highlighted the complexity of the provisions and the way in which they interrelate. That complexity is deepened by the addition of 116 Government amendments. Our advisers found it difficult to understand how the Bill would work, how the amendments would affect its provisions or the overall impact of the tax laws. In such circumstances, there was not enough time to produce a detailed and constructive input. Consultation with professional organisations was inadequate, so we felt that it might make matters worse to table amendments with which we were not fully satisfied. However, in no way do we abdicate our responsibilities on this section of the Bill. The Government must take ultimate responsibility for the final wording of clause 77 and the other provisions on loan relationships, but we shall make constructive criticisms and cross-examine the Minister to elicit clarification of any ambiguities. Some parts of the Bill have not been amended but many clauses are interrelated. It is in the interest of all members of the Committee that we produce good legislation, which is why we have adopted our approach to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am finding it difficult to follow the argument put forward by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien). As a Conservative Member of the Committee I was able to table a number of amendments to this part of the Bill. I do not understand why the Labour party does not have the facility to do likewise. It is disappointing that Labour Members did not want to support any of my amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have certainly considered them as indeed has the whole Committee. In many ways, the hon. Gentleman's amendments are constructive. When we dealt with one of his amendments on Thursday, the Minister raised some valid points against it, although in principle, I thought that there was a lot to commend it. It is a matter of striking balances. The complexity of the issue has deterred many from trying to understand it. My great concern—although I will not waste the Committee's time by detailing it again—is that we are creating a dog's dinner, which we will have to revisit for many years to come. Any person who wants to make good law would share that concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now is probably the best time to return to a matter of particular concern—project finance and the way in which it applies to the various accounting methods. The Government have set out in clause 77 two principal accounting methods, which members of the Committee will no doubt be familiar with: the mark-to-market basis and the accruals basis. We have had representations about the difficulties that the provision may cause for capital project finance in developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A British company that wants to become involved in a capital investment in a developing country or in eastern Europe also wants to ensure that it is protected. It is therefore likely to undertake its involvement in that country in such a way as to protect itself. That is normally by way of a loan investment, which means that the return on the investment—the interest on it—may not be payable for several years. It seems that the way in which the clause and other relevant provisions operate with respect to the two accounting methods will cause problems. They have been outlined in correspondence from Ernst and Young, which all members of the Committee have no doubt been sent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The return comes after several years, but it appears that the taxation could come early—where it is calculated on an accruals basis, it could come almost straight away and the company could end up paying taxes before it has received any return. Ernst and Young has set out some examples of how that could arise, which raise several issues about the way in which the two accounting methods are being imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said—I want to make it clear—that there is great merit in having only two methods. However, there is no great advantage if we do not also allow a number of exceptions when it is valid to do so. The measure addresses circumstances that a Government would want to encourage; all parties would say that there is great merit in encouraging the development of third-world markets as well as investment in them, deriving a return from them and building trading partners not only in eastern Europe but in the third world, too. We want to encourage that and do not, therefore, want to undermine the basis on which companies undertake such loan relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies undertake those loan relationships for a reason. We cannot just say, as I suspect the Minister might, that we do not want to subject the whole basis
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
of our legislation on loan relationships to accommodating capital project developments in other countries because that would undermine the basis of the taxation system that we are trying to create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the answer, we must behave with a great deal of care because there are stronger arguments for such developments than for other projects which companies undertake without good reason. Here, no doubt, we all think that there is a good reason for carrying out such investment and that we should not try to undermine it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for using a loan investment are clear: to operate through a loan investment type of relationship gives investors a degree of priority over the cash flow that might come from the company in which they invested. Many countries have, if not a record of instability, the possibility of instability. Difficulties have arisen in Russia and in other countries where there have been levels of instability almost unprecendented in the past 50 years. In such circumstances, those who want to invest in eastern Europe countries in particular might want to use a loan investment, which might be undermined by the accruals basis of calculation of the taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further problem is that inadequate company laws might exist in the country where the British business tries to invest. For example, as Ernst and Young make clear, it was not possible to redeem share capital or to issue preference shares in Russia until relatively recently. In those circumstances, loan relationships might represent a way to protect the capital of the company investing from the United Kingdom. Such countries also often have currencies which are subject to fluctuation and that might be quite damaging to any investment undertaken by a British company. Again, that is a good reason why a company might want to undertake the investment through a loan relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a whole series of arguments for saying that loan relationships are a good means to undertake invesment in an eastern European country or a developing country. There are strong arguments in favour of such investment and it should not, therefore, be undermined. At the moment, it is not being undermined. Schedule D, cases 3 and 4 show that taxation is based on the full amount of the income arising in any accounting period. So, if interest is received from an investment, tax will be paid on it—that is all fair and good. If no interest is received, no tax needs to be paid. However, clause 77 and the next couple of clauses appear to impose a straitjacket on the ability to carry out such investment by insisting that it be assessed either on an accruals basis or a mark-to-market basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A mark-to-market basis seems, on the face of it, to accommodate the difficulties, but there are restrictions in the Bill on how a mark-to-market basis can be used—perhaps the Minister could address that. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
only circumstances in which it seems to be allowed is where the business previously compiled its accounts on a mark-to-market basis or is engaged in a business that normally would do so. But capital investment projects in eastern European countries are often one-off by nature, put together by groups of investors who set up a company for the purpose. They therefore would not seem to be able to use the most appropriate system, the mark-to-market basis, for assessing tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in doubt about the Government's intention. Do the Government mean that any business may make a clear choice between the accruals basis or the mark-to-market basis, or do they mean that the mark-to-market basis can only be used if a company has a record of using it? That would restrict companies' ability to use that system, and the accruals basis could have a detrimental impact on an investment project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ernst and Young briefing letter contains two examples that are worth looking at. Both are important, and I should be grateful for an assurance from the Minister either that they would remain available under the new regime or that the Government intend to amend the Bill on Report to accommodate them. First, Ernst and Young offer the example of a United Kingdom company making a loan to a third-party bank, which in turn invests in Russia. The briefing states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The terms of the loan, and its interrelation with the broader project structure … are assumed to be as follows: interest is calculated on the basis of the outstanding balance at LIBOR plus 3%; interest is payable 6 monthly; however, the amount actually payable at any payment date will be capped at the borrower's available funds at the payment date, less any amounts payable to the EBRD. Unpaid interest is payable on the next six month payment date, until such time as it is eventually paid".</p></blockquote>
Ernst and Young suggest that the underlying project in this case is oil and gas exploration, but it could be anything to do with exploiting natural resources by means of a project incurring considerable capital expenditure over the next six to seven years. The brieing adds that
	<br><blockquote><p>"until that period has elapsed the project is not expected to generate sufficient positive cash flows to meet more than the EBRD payment schedules. It is therefore assumed that no payment will be made until betweeen 7 and 10 years after the original grant of the loan".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman and Ernst and Young are making a frightful meal of this matter. No payments are to be made until between seven and 10 years have elapsed after the original grant of the loan, and there is to be some kind of capping of payments according to the borrower's available funds at the payment date. An exception to the statement of standard accounting practice No. 2 is referred to in the second paragraph on page 3 of the Ernst and Young letter, where it is stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it should be noted that an accruals treatment would not be required under SSAP 2 if there was considerable uncertainty as to whether the interest would actually be received so that the prudent concept would be applied instead."</p></blockquote>
There is an important exception to SSAP 2, which sets out the accruals concept. It is that it is overridden by prudence. In a case such as has been described, where interest is not due for seven or 10 years, and there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
a cap—apparently related to available funds—on the requirement for the borrower to pay, would not the accruals concept be overidden by the prudence concept?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will answer that. If what the hon. Gentleman says is correct then Ernst and Young, a firm of accountants with a considerable reputation, has got it wrong. I am not sure that it has. I do not want to delve into confidential negotiations, but I hope that the Minister will reassure us. No doubt, if the hon. Gentleman had attended the meeting with civil servants that I attended yesterday, he, too, would be concerned about this aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are potential problems. They may be resolved, as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I am not convinced that they can be. Let us hear what the Minister says, and we can then then deal with those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other example—no doubt the Minister has seen the documentation—is a United Kingdom company that uses an intermediary—an offshore partner in Cyprus—to make a loan, which then makes a loan to the third-party bank, which makes a loan to Russia. A not dissimilar financial set-up is organised. We want the Minister to reassure us that that set-up will still be allowed either in that form or in a similar one and that such investments will be allowed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us what
	<br><blockquote><p>"a just and reasonable basis"</p></blockquote>
means in clause 77(3)(b)? The Chartered Institute of Taxation has already expressed doubts about the concept in relation to amendment No. 218, which we have dealt with. "Just and reasonable" is a lawyer's concept that they and perhaps Ministers can apply in a legal context. But how will taxpayers know what it means to allocate £50,000 between two accounting periods on "a just and reasonable basis"? The lack of precision causes some concern. It is likely to cause confusion, because the requirement of "a just and reasonable basis" relies on an opinion by the reasonable man—the man in the Clapham omnibus, in Lord Denning's view. Lord Denning would no doubt say that the only way in which any lawyer can judge what is just and reasonable is to ask the man on the Clapham omnibus—the man on the jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several professional organisations have expressed concern that as a consequence of the imprecision in parts of the Bill the taxpayer will not know whether he has done the right thing until the Inland Revenue tells him that he has done the wrong thing. He will be caught in a Kafkaesque situation: he will not know where the boundaries are and what the rules are because they are so ambiguous and unclear. Clause 77(3)(b) is another example of that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern that clause 77(4) does not cover the mark-to-market approach required by the banks. They allow their capital to be valued on that basis but not the interest. Can the Minister clarify that her Department's consultations have satisfied the banks that they will still be able to distinguish interest and capital when they assess whether to use a mark-to-market or an accrued basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 77 is very welcome. It goes to the heart of the new arrangements by making a fundamental change in the way in which interest receivable and payable is recognised for tax purposes. That will be a useful simplification; I strongly believe in ensuring that taxable profit is as close as possible to recognised profit in a company's accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that, given the subjectivity in many areas of the methods of arriving at reported profit, that it is not possible simply to say that reported profit is taxable profit. There must be safeguards and the clause is a significant step in the right direction. Most trading companies use the accruals basis and will now be taxed on the interest that they recognise as either payable or receivable in their accounts; the minority of companies—financial services companies—that operate on a mark-to-market basis will be taxed on that basis. There will perhaps be one or two exceptions, but generally we will operate in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in favour of introducing many more exceptions. Ernst and Young seem to want a special exception for project finance. I am not persuaded by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire that there is a need for that. In the example that he cited it would be imprudent to recognise interest receivable if it were not due for seven or 10 years and there were doubt about whether it would ever be received. I look forward to the comments of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by picking up the first point made by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire relating to the qualms that some hon. Members expressed on schedule 8, which we discussed last Thursday. We covered those concerns in our amendments to the schedule and any remaining quibbles relate to the detail of how it is to be implemented—but we also covered that on Thursday. I announced then that we would publish open guidance, which would cover any worries about how the amended schedule and clauses would work in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister seen the detailed analysis from Freshfields? She might not have got it yet, in which case I can ensure that she does. It relates to the detail of the clause, which cannot be dealt with merely by guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had detailed responses from both the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Those organisations, which represent a considerable depth of knowledge, have accepted my points, particularly on open guidance. It is interesting that both organisations recognise that our amendments substantially pick up the concerns that they raised. One or two points still remain and I shall refer to them as much as I can, in order to make it clear to the Committee what we have been doing: addressing, as far as we can, those concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
This part of the Bill introduces changes to accountancy practice to bring taxation methods into line with companies' accounting methods. We have done that because it has been required of us by the professions—it was the practitioners, not Parliament who pressured us for change. We need to keep that firmly in our minds. The hon. Gentleman said that he and his party did not wish to table amendments to this part of the Bill. I agree with him that in many respects it is a section for experts, which is why they have been so involved in the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with accounting methods, which were the subject of the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks. The Bill deals extensively with two main types of accounting—known as accruals or mark to market. Within those categories there is flexibility: the Bill also refers to normal accounting practice, which can be different under certain circumstances. There can be straight-line or economic accruals. Both are acceptable because both are part of normal accounting practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed concern about the so-called clean mark-to-market approach, which is a method often used by banks. Yes, the Bill allows for both clean and dirty mark to market. However, a question mark was raised with us as to whether the Bill truly achieved that, so we covered it by tabling an amendment to the next clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also recognises a variety of other methods that are covered by the general heading of normal accountancy practice. For example, there are special rules for insurance companies and collective investment schemes included under the acronym SORP, to which we shall return later. Friendly societies provide another example since they effectively account by regulatory return. I mention those examples because the clause sets out a general framework within which companies can operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not trying to be too restrictive, but there have to be some restrictions. We do not want to detract from the simplicity of the general provision by taking all particulars into account. If we said that there were only two authorised methods and we gave no other description apart from accruals or mark to market, that would be too vague, which is why the clause provides some criteria against which the methods can be judged. We do not want to be too rigid either. The criteria allow sufficient flexibility for companies normally to follow their usual practices in company law accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Chartered Accountants raised the issue of using GAAP—another form of accounting practice—as opposed to normal accountancy practice. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will know all about that rather nice distinction. Many lawyers might pick up the niceties but to the common man on the omnibus, normal accounting practice means precisely that. I can give an assurance that the Revenue will monitor the application of the legislation. If innovative methods of accounting are developed that are equally compatible with the two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
methods outlined in the Bill, we will give them serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accounting practices clearly do not stand still. That is why we have established a general framework but put some constraints within it to ensure reasonable protection and reasonable conformity. Interestingly, big companies represented by the CBI—which one would expect to be most affected by the provisions—have not raised any issues with us on general accounting methods. Our fundamental principle is to ensure that rules mirror normal accountancy practice. It will be simpler for companies to handle in future. We made that point last week, so I shall not refer to my example again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of concern that Ernst and Young raised those points. Project finance is important, and I can say with all sincerity that the Bill makes some project finance much easier. We dealt with the capitalisation of interest point, for instance, on Thursday. Later clauses will allow companies to raise finance via a type of limited interest bond that is currently precluded to them. The ability to raise finance for complicated projects is, therefore, enhanced in many respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ernst and Young raised specific concerns about a company that had borrowed money and loaned it abroad to finance a project—in effect accounting on an accruals basis for the interest on the money that it had borrowed. The interest that it expected to come from the project did not then, however, turn up and, although it had not been paid the money, the company acccrued as if it had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. The company does not expect the interest to be payable for up to 10 years, so it will not be paid before that period. It is not a matter of the interest being expected and not turning up—it is not expected until later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, the matter comes down to making the usual accounting provisions, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said. The proposed changes ensure that tax follows the accounts. A consortia company that sets out on a project that involves extensive risks—there are some funny parts of the world where such risks exist—will be able to assess the risk as far as its accounting practices are concerned. We must recognise that there is instability in some countries, and consortia—working through an overseas company—will take part in the majority of overseas projects. They can make provisions through their accountant for a variety of circumstances. It is unlikely that a company will rush off to finance an overseas project in a risky part of the world, and there are relatively few such projects. Furthermore, when a company or consortia—I keep harping on about consortia, but they are largely involved—undertakes a project, it does so with an enormous amount of tax advice and all the available expertise. That is why the provisions will not cause the hiatus that Ernst and Young has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to the term
	<br><blockquote><p>"a just and reasonable basis".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
That is not new in accounting practice, and accountants are well used to splitting payments between different periods. If they do so in accordance with the usual accounting practice, that will be fine. The phrase "just and reasonable" freqeuently appears in the Taxes Act, and is well understood by lawyers, tax experts and accountants. The man on the Clapham omnibus might not understand it, but I doubt whether he will be involved with this aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last point concerned mark to market and accruals. I believe the hon. Gentleman asked whether companies had a clear choice between one or the other accounting practice. The answer is that they have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the Minister's two last points. She said that there was a choice; can she confirm that that is a clean choice, because that is not my reading of the Bill? As I understand them, clauses 77 and 78 seem to require that there be some pre-existing use of mark to market before it can be used, or that organisations are entering a business sector where such criteria would normally be used to calculate the accounts. Can the Minister clarify whether there is a complete, open choice, entirely up to companies? That is not my understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister dealt with the issue of the man on the Clapham omnibus and the "just and reasonable" point. It is true, as she said, that ordinary individuals might not very often have to deal with such a problem in an accounting situation, but, on occasion, they might have to. It might be that a relatively small business—perhaps comprising a person, his wife and a few employees—has a somewhat complex loan relationship. In those circumstances, the issue of "just and reasonable" might have to be calculated. The business might use an accountant in a small town who might not have access to all the complexities of how lawyers would analyse the phrase "just and reasonable". An ambiguity exists and will cause difficulties. I am not satisfied that the Minister has dealt with the problem. We must warn the Minister and the Government that such ambiguities line up problems for future legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the Minister has dealt with the main issue: the Ernst and Young submission. She seemed to suggest that the submission would relate to few projects—all too few in our opinion. Ought not we to be in the business of encouraging investment in the developing world, Russia and eastern Europe so that those economies, which have experienced enormous difficulties, are built up and become long-term trading partners with Britain so that we all benefit from the growth of trade? We ought to be in the business of encouraging that, but the Minister's comment that the measure applies to a few projects, which will all receive good tax advice anyway, does not deal with the issue at all. The submission should cover more projects and we ought not to put unnecessary difficulties in the way of such projects if we can avoid doing so. If the Minister can satisfy us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
that such difficulties cannot be avoided and that changes to accommodate such circumstances would so undermine the purpose of the Bill's measures on loan relationships that we cannot make such exceptions, that is all very well. But at the moment, the Minister has not attempted to do that. She has virtually brushed the issue aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield quoted a section on page 3 of the Ernst and Young submission. Perhaps it is worth studying that in more detail, because the Minister appeared to suggest that that would be how projects could be saved. Had Ernst and Young believed that, it would not have felt it necessary to make such a submission. Can the Minister confirm that what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield thought might be the case is the case? That might deal with my query.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its submission, Ernst and Young writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an accounting treatment is in accordance with SSAP 2, it would … seem that … the accounting treatment will be acceptable for tax purposes: it should be noted that an accruals treatment would not be required under SSAP 2 if there was considerable uncertainty as to whether the interest would actually be received so that the prudence concept would be applied instead."</p></blockquote>
Is that the case? The submission continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In such cases, it seems possible that the SSAP 2 treatment could be overridden for tax purposes, because of the requirement in the proposed legislation to assume that all payments will be paid unless the debt is proved or estimated to be bad. The fact that there is an inevitable delay before the interest will be received would not be sufficient grounds not to recognise the income."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister will deal with that. The submission goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no specific accounting standard which deals with the accounting treatment of interest received, although specific provisions regarding interest paid are set out in FRS4 'Capital Instruments'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>With regards to the recognition of interest, FRS5 has not changed the practical application of SSAP 2. Interest remains recognisable in an accretion basis as long as no significant uncertainty exists as to the measurability or collectibility."</p></blockquote>
There is, of course, some uncertainty in such circumstances, but it is not such that the company falls into a bad debts category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The submission continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the provisions of the Companies Act, the only grounds on which a company would be permitted not to comply with SSAP 2 would be that compliance with the above provisions would not result in a 'true and fair' view of the company's results. It is generally accepted that this would only be applied to justify not making an accrual in situations where the interest payment is contingent on a particular event happening in the accrual period, and both that event does not happen and the interest not paid is not rolled up for payment in future years. These are not the terms of project loans currently in place, as they do not preserve the Western investor's prior right to income."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, Ernst and Young, which is a firm of respected and important accountants with major offices just across the river from us—no doubt its employees are peering across now and wondering what the Committee is up to—is concerned that the rules do not allow their clients to be involved in what they ought to be able to be involved in, and in what I suspect all of us think they ought to be involved in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
Unless the Minister says that those suppositions about SSAP 2 and the various ways around it are right, Ernst and Young's point is not being answered. Either she is saying that she has given an effective answer, or she is saying that the Government cannot deal with those points, in which case either they will consult to see if there is some way round it—which might be included in next year's Finance Bill—or they will tell such organisations that they cannot be accommodated, so they cannot continue with those sorts of projects and must find an alternative way. Which is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about the use of mark to market and whether that accounting method had to be used previously in order for a business to decide to use it. Companies can choose their method, provided that they follow their accounts. There is no requirement that mark to market should have been used before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth the hon. Gentleman remembering that the vast majority of companies in this country use the accruals accounting method because it most suits their business and their normal accounting practice, If, however, they want to use mark to market and if the nature of their business allows them to, they can choose it—it is their choice, not ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that the man on the Clapham omnibus would not understand the "just and reasonable" basis in the way that the hon. Gentleman used it. It is perhaps worth while to remind members of the Committee that accountants are well used to splitting payments between different periods. If they do so in accordance with normal accounting practice, all will be fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will a small company in a small town do if it uses a one-man band of accountants? It will borrow money straight from the bank, it will account on an accruals basis and it will pay tax on an accruals basis in the future as it has in the past. Most companies in this country will not be touched by the Bill. It is pertinent to those people who raise money by a complex variety of methods. It is just and reasonable to continue to use the expression "just and reasonable basis", because it is a concept well known to accountants, is used in Taxes Acts and is well understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a little unreasonable to say that we are restricting or not encouraging project finance in overseas economies. That is not correct. I shall not rehearse my earlier points, particularly regarding the changes in the Bill that will help companies to raise finance by certain routes which are barred to them at the moment. We have had considerable praise for our approach. However, it is worth repeating that tax follows the accounts. If accountants recognise a profit on an accruals basis, it will be taxed on an accruals basis. The tax system should always follow the accounts: the complaint in the past was that the tax system did not follow the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Ernst and Young point is that in those circumstances the tax does not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
follow the accounts; nor does it take account of commercial realities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very unlikely that the companies involved in the arrangements referred to in that letter do not follow accruals or mark-to-market accounts. I would be amazed if they did not. They may have one loan that they account for in one way and another loan that they account for in another way. The issue is not whether they come under that general conformity, but whether the loan relationship clauses in the Bill will restrict the participation of companies and consortia of companies in overseas projects. That point has been raised by Ernst and Young. We have not received a great body of mail on that point. Probably the best thing that Ernst and Young can do is to get together with officials at the Inland Revenue and go through in detail the specific points that it wants to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a United Kingdom company finances an overseas project on an accruals basis, potentially there could be a different arrangement in the future from that of the past. The reason for that is that tax will follow the accounts and a company will accrue interest receivable in its accounts. In the past, a company may have been able to show the interest as accruing in its accounts and contributing to its profits available for distribution to shareholders and will not have paid tax on that interest until it was finally paid. But it will still have to pay tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accountants will have to handle not only simple project finance deals but complex financial deals. They will first have to decide whether and when a project will start to pay its way, at what point and how many years ahead will something be received from the project, how they should account for that within their accounts, and what provisions they should make. The Bill provides that the taxation follows those accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not satisfied me that the Government have fully taken on board the reality of the situation. Ernst and Young believes that the change will have "a significant adverse impact" and that what the Government seek to do does not reflect economic realities. The Government said that their proposals would bring the operation of taxation into line with commercial realities. The Minister has not explained how that has been done in the case that has been discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take issue with the hon. Gentleman on that. I ask him to bear in mind that companies will be able to make a tax provision if there is uncertainty as to whether interest will be received. That is the whole point of the proposal.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 251, in page 50, line 46, after "section" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(but subject to subsection (5A) below)".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendments Nos. 252, 253 and 311.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is about the accounting methods that companies can use for tax purposes. It will settle a matter raised in representations and will put beyond doubt that companies using a particular basis of accounting will in general be able to follow that basis for tax purposes. The amendment relates to mark-to-market accounting. The anxiety has been expressed that clean mark-to-market accounting could not be followed. The amendment confirms that it can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions for the Minister. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, commenting on the amendments, argued that amendments Nos. 251 to 255 do not achieve their intended purpose of allowing companies to adopt a clean mark-to-market basis for tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a basis does not appear to involve bringing the relationships into account on a fair value, as clause 77(1)(b) requires. Certainly, new subsection (5A)(a) proposed to clause 78 in amendment No. 253 assumes that that would not happen. Even if proposed new subsection (5A)(b) were satisfied, the effect would only be to allow the company to use an authorised mark-to-market basis for tax purposes rather than the clean version that it uses in its accounts. In view of that, it is arguable that one or other of those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
paragraphs requires amendment to allow for the use of a clean basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 253, what does "purports to allocate" in 78(5)(a) mean? Why not use the word "allocate"? Does not "purports to allocate" create confusion? It at least raises the possibility that it might—surely we want to reduce ambiguity and clarify the situation? In the light of Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart and of the potential ambiguity, perhaps the Minister could clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Warwickshire keeps referring to Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart, but that is likely to be relevant to our discussion in Committee only if there is any ambiguity about what the legislation says—but the legislation is clear. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has explained that Government amendments seek to put the matter beyond any doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can assist the Minister. My point about Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart related to the question of ambiguity. Does the hon. Gentleman understand exactly what the words "purports to allocate" mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that a court would have any difficulty in interpreting those words. That is all I am saying. I do not see that the phrase is ambiguous; "purports to allocate" clearly has a meaning different from "allocates"—otherwise the parliamentary draftsman would not have used it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Economic Secretary said, the object of her amendments is to make it clear beyond any doubt that the tax treatment will follow the accounting treatment when the mark-to-market basis of accounting is used. My next point is related to the previous one and is an extension of the point about Ernst and Young. That company was concerned solely about project finance, but its point was an illustration of a wider point: many organisations, particularly banks, have interest receivable—that is, they will be owed interest in future months and years. At the moment, if such organisations believe that there is no realistic prospect of that interest being received in the foreseeable future and that it would therefore be sensible to apply the prudence concept, they simply do not bring the interest into their accounts. An alternative would be to introduce the interest and then to make a bad debt provision to net it out. I would like reassurance from my hon. Friend that that practice, which is widespread among banks, will continue to be acceptable under the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said repeatedly, the purpose of the legislation is to ensure that tax follows normal accounting practice; that entirely covers my hon. Friend's point. The response to the question of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire about the chartered accountants' comments and whether the amendment covers the clean mark-to-market accounting is that the amendment ensures that that method of accounting, which is common among
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
banks, can continue to be used. We believed that we had covered the point before the amendment was tabled. The amendment makes it clear that that method can be used. We are satisfied that the amendment will produce the desired result: the Revenue's guidance to tax office staff will confirm it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was raised about "purports to allocate". I know that it was also raised by the Law Society. Quibbles often arise when one lawyer says one thing and another lawyer another. They often become eternal quibbles. Nevertheless, we have tried to ensure that the words "purports to allocate" actually mean "seeks to allocate"—the requisite meaning in this case. There is no sinister intent behind it. It is simply a form of words that produces the intended result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person responsible for a company's accounts makes an allocation in a manner disapproved by the Revenue but in line with a specific understanding of the clause, would that be acceptable provided it were done in a bone fide way? I understand the Minister's point, but the impact would seem to produce that effect. Will it be acceptable if the person "seeks to" follow the right procedure but actually gets it wrong? I am grateful to the Minister for her clarification of the clean mark-to-market basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined are probably covered by the expression that we debated in the previous clause—"normal accountancy practice". Over generations and right across the country, accountants have been able to determine whether normal accountancy practices have been followed. I am sure that they will be able to establish that for generations to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The orginal clause specified a period of six years for the connections betweeen individuals, but that has been reduced to two years. The effect of the clause is to reduce the availability of bad debt relief when the parties have been connected at some time in the two years before the transaction in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary say why a period of two years has been proposed? Why did the Bill originally stipulate six years? Why not one year, or three? What is the logical basis for those apparently arbitrary numbers? Is there any conmmercial logic behind the choice, or merely a Treasury judgment? What consultations were held with the appropriate organisations about the period of time for which the restrictions would apply?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received various submissions on the matter. In none of them was a period of two years recommended. I may have missed the relevant submission, in which case I should be grateful if the Minister would tell the Committee which organisation suggested that period. Perhaps the suggestion was made by the Treasury, or perhaps the amendment is the result of a compromise after negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to find the commercial logic behind the proposal. I am aware that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales rejected the six-
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
year period as much too long, as did other organisations such as the Law Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society's submission made it clear that that body considered sub-paragraph (4) to be too broad. It is presumably intended to cover back-to-back loans, but the Law Society says that the implications go much wider. It has suggested the alternative concept set out in section 209 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which concerns a company being
	<br><blockquote><p>"put in funds directly or indirectly"</p></blockquote>
by another company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has clearly decided not to alter the proposal, except by means of subsection (3)(a). However, the reason for her taking that view is not clear. I should be grateful for an explanation of her reasoning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, bad debt relief is still denied to venture capital organisations. Such companies will, for example, provide loans in a management buy-out, and will participate and take shares in the project. New clause 22 is lengthy and must be taken in relation to clause 79. In it, the Government seek to tackle the point in a very complex manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members agree that it is important that we get the matter right. Failure to do so would undermine investment. The complex tax provisions in clause 79 and in new clause 22 might reduce the appetite for higher risks, thus undermining the ability of venture capitalists to get involved. That could reduce the appetite for very high-risk investment and enhance the all-too-recent shift in markets towards low-risk investments. Government and Opposition Members have sought to alter that trend by creating venture capital trusts and other types of investment vehicle, but the danger still exists and we must satisfy ourselves that clause 79 and new clause 22 do not enhance a trend that we have tried to reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of relief on bad debt means that, to some extent, the Government take a share in the consequences of high-risk investments with the investor. By reducing access to relief, the Government reduce the incentive to take a risk. That must be approached with great care. I fear that the way in which clause 79 inter-relates with new clause 22 could produce a significant disincentive. Under new clause 22(2)(d), (e) and (f), the restrictions seem quite considerable, albeit less so than in the original Bill. Why is there a figure of 30 per cent. in respect of the assets in the beneficial ownership of connected persons? Why is the figure 30 per cent. and not another figure? The same question can be asked of the two-year period. What are the implications of the rules for venture capitalism? The measures seem arbitrary and tortuous and I am growing concerned that the complexity of the rules might have the deterrent effect already mentioned. The lack of clarity means that people might not be sure whether they receive relief. Even were they to receive relief, that lack of clarity might provide a degree of disincentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that lawyers and accountants will err on the side of caution and tell their clients that they will not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
know whether they have broken a law until such time as the Inland Revenue tells them. We have an almost Kafkaesque situation where the complexity means that people do not know whether they are guilty until after they have committed the crime—they are never sure where the boundaries are. Such vagueness and complexity in the rules would itself be a deterrent to investment. I am not suggesting that that is the Government's intention, but it is the consequence of the rather hurried way with which the whole matter has been dealt. The Government must beware of undermining investment, which is the key to our economic future. To do anything that might undermine it must be approached with a great deal of caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other clauses try to impose complex legal concepts on very practical commercial situations. I have run my own business as has the Economic Secretary, but I am not sure whether the experienced draftsmen of the legislation have dealt with the type of situation for which they are legislating. New subsection (3A), introduced by amendment No. 264, is another of the Government's complexities, suggested, I suspect, because of their privatisation ideology. Can the Economic Secretary confirm that for two companies which have been under the control of a Minister or a Government Department, the two-year rule will not apply? What is the reason for that? Is it that the rule about connected persons not getting bad debt relief should only apply when it does not conflict with the Government's ideology of privatisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I wonder whether you could explain the selection of amendments. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire referred to Government amendment No. 264, but it does not appear on the selection list. He also referred to the new clause, which provides exemption for clause 79. I understand why he has referred to both those measures, but how can six Government amendments and a new clause not have been selected for discussion with the clause stand part debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help. We discussed the measures with another clause on Thursday. The amendments that relate to clause 79 were grouped with other amendments on a similar matter. They were discussed on Thursday, but we could not vote on them then because they did not relate to the clause that we were debating. If that seems obscure, I should tell the hon. Gentleman that I have a huge list of amendments before me and am also having difficulty understanding where we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised the issue on Thursday, so I might assist the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. When a subject is first raised, related amendments can be considered even if they do not relate to the clause to which the lead amendment refers. That is the reason for the complexity. I have spent much time trying to work my way through the issue, as has the Economic Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of the two-year rule not applying to privatised businesses, are not the Government giving perks to privatised companies that they do not concede to other organisations? Government Departments could have long-term connections and, once they are privatised, that could have an impact on the way in which companies proceed in the future. Why are privileges being extended to such companies, but not to others? Where is the level playing field for the recently privatised companies, two of which might be connected, and companies that were never in the public sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 79(3) deals with connected persons. How has the Government resolved the issue of denying bad debt reliefs to a building society if borrowers are members of the society and have voting rights? Several organisations have raised that issue. I think that the Government have dealt with it, but I am not sure from my reading of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still not entirely convinced that the Government have resolved the issue of malicious borrowers who cost the bank or other organisation that extends them a loan much money by buying a share in it and thereby costing it a portion of its tax relief. Has that been dealt with in these or later amendments? It is difficult to work out under which clause the matter should be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of new clause 22(1) is unclear. Does it really deal with the issues that several professional organisations have raised? The Institute of Chartered Accountants has noted that relief will in any event be available for genuine bad debts and will, therefore, be subject to the wide-ranging anti-avoidance provisions of paragraph 12 of schedule 8. It asks, therefore, why the Government have decided that there should never be relief for bad debts under normal circumstances between parties that are or have recently been under a common control, even where those bad debts have arisen in a bona fide and completely proper manner? The main purpose of those bad debts would not be to avoid tax. The institute is asking for the two-year rule to be removed and wants to know why we need it given that there are such extensive anti-avoidance provisions. Those provisions—in particular the main purpose clause, which I and some Conservative Members criticised—are onerous and might have dealt with the issue. I am not sure that they would do so, but perhaps the Financial Secretary could deal with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Freshfields, a leading law firm, has said that the definition of "tax advantage" is too wide and inadequate and that "just and reasonable" apportionment does not fit comfortably into self-assessment. It said that the provisions in paragraph 12 of schedule 8 in particular are asymmetrical and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
debits can be disallowed in whole or in part, but if the debt is waived by the creditor, the whole amount waived will have to be brought into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary must deal with a number of issues. Freshfields referred to the definition of "tax advantage" in section 709 of the 1988 Act, the principal purpose of which is to prevent the extraction of profits from companies in a non-taxable form. Is the failure of paragraph 12 of schedule 8 to deal with those issues the reason why the Government have felt it necessary to deal with those problems in the context of not only clause 79, but new clause 22?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society says that clause 79(2) is sweeping and it is not convinced that it is appropriate for a company that holds listed securities issued by a connected person. Furthermore, a debtor company may not know who owns its securities. What if they are held in a clearing system or by a nominee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society's other representations have been dealt with, but it also says that the provisions of clause 79(4) are too broad and presumably apply to back-to-back loans. It suggests that the concept under section 209 of the 1988 Act of a company "being put in funds directly or indirectly" by another company should be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that the Economic Secretary is sorting out her papers, so I repeat that the clause is one of great complexity, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said. The amendments have been discussed in a cursory manner: we have only been able to skate over them. I and our advisers have had to work our way through the amendments and that has taken an effort of will and sleepless nights. The Government have tried to get the clause right in a rushed manner. I see that the Financial Secretary is now ready, so I can sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw the Financial Secretary blanche when the hon. Gentleman referred to him and expected him to answer his points. He can carry on writing: he will be relieved to know that I shall reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to begin by referrring to the main representations on clause 79. Arguments have been put about whether it means one thing if drafted one way, or something else if it is drafted a different way. We must accept that every draftsman has a different way of doing things. So some points are substantive, and others are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires companies that are connected to another party to a loan relationship to use an authorised accruals basis of accounting in respect of that relationship so as to ensure symmetry of treatment for tax purposes for such connected companies. Special rules apply only to connected persons. These are primarily tax avoidance measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned that he had been up all night with a wet towel around his head sorting out the various points with his advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
It is fair to tell him that the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Law Society and indeed others have done precisely the same thing. When the Institute of Chartered Accountants reported back to us on the amendments, clause 79 was not mentioned as a problem. Similarly, the Law Society's concerns are now down to a handful of problems. It raised the issue of the period of time of connection with respect to the clause's application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the three major representations made to us was that the six-year period in the clause was too long. We chose that period because it was standard within tax law. It was not unreasonable to assume that six years would be appropriate. As consultation progressed, it became clear that six years was too long and two years would be more satisfactory. Two years was picked because there must be a reasonable balance between what is happening within companies in real life and protection for the Exchequer. Businesses themselves proposed the two-year period. It seemed a suitable compromise because it is widely accepted and is reasonable for groups of companies to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second major representations were about the definition of connections through being a participator. It was considered far too wide. It swept in people who had only a fortuitous interest in a company making a loan. Building societies and banks are obvious examples. The amendments would set the definition of participator at five. Those fortuitously swept up—such as the person involved with a building society or a bank—are removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third major point was about using the accruals method of accounting for the debt of connected companies. It was said that it was out of line with economic reality for a financial trader who is part of a group to buy and sell its debt in the same way as the debt of independent third parties is bought and sold. Originally, that financial trader would have had to account for his financial trading in relation to the group of companies' debt on an accruals basis, but the rest on a mark-to-market basis, which is clearly not viable. We therefore tabled a new clause to deal with those circumstances. It will ensure that where a bona fide financial trader is part of a group, he can account on a mark-to-market basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire raised a number of issues, of which the 30 per cent. limit was one. The criteria for tests were not picked out of the air, but set in conjunction with the British Bankers Association, which is most likely to represent groups facing these circumstances. At the end of those discussions, we came up with the new clause to cater for a real, specific situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Venture capital companies are an important part of the exercise. Some of the changes that were made to schedule 8 with regard to connected and unconnected companies and debt relief in certain situations cover the majority of points made by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire. If he recalls, I tried to describe the circumstances behind the amendments to that schedule, which related to many such lender and borrower situations. I picked up some of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
comments about venture capital companies, especially the participator point. Put together, they answer most of the hon. Gentleman's questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A company that is connected with a company in which it invests under one or more of the tests set out—for example, because it holds the majority of the share capital—will be treated as connected with that company. That is as true for venture capital companies, which invest in other companies with a view to making a profit on their loans or shareholdings, as for any other company. The amendment that we tabled to define a participator also means that a venture capital company will be treated as a participator in another company only if the second company is under the control of five or fewer persons. That removes the concern that a venture capital company would always be treated as a participator simply because it both made a loan to, and held shares in, a company. Clearly, it would not necessarily have to hold shares in a company; in that case, only a loan would be involved and the participator definition would be totally irrelevant in the majority of cases. Nevertheless, an arrangement that involved shares and loans would be picked up only if it fell within the new definition of participator. The definition has been dramatically changed, because the original has swept in categories that it was not intended to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is worth repeating with regard to debt relief. Before the change, one could envisage a debt-equity swap where the lender could not get tax relief, so the borrower was charged. On Thursday, we made changes to the Bill so that if the lender was unconnected with the borrower before the debt-equity swap started, he could get tax relief and the potential charge on the borrower would be removed. The change catered for a particular situation, which was outlined by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire, and I think he will find that is covers his points if he also takes into account my earlier comments on participators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On privatisation, it is correct to say that the amendment would remove the controlled company provision from a company if it was connected to another company, solely because they were or had been companies under one of the Government Departments. The amendment is not an innovation, but a return to the old situation. At the moment, any company that falls into that category is not connected. The definition of connection in the Bill could create a connection where it is not intended. The amendment would therefore ensure that the status quo is maintained. We covered that point on Thursday, because the hon. Gentleman asked me that precise question then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can illustrate that alphabetically. Suppose that Government company B controls companies C, D and E and that Government company A controls companies G and H. Those companies are, by
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
anyone's reckoning, totally separate, but unless the legislation is passed one could inadvertently have C, which is on the B side, connected to G, which is on the A side. That illogical situation can arise and that is why we are removing the possibility of its occurring. In practice, British Rail could be connected to the Milk Marketing Board, which is patently absurd. It is not a question of extra perks for privatisation, but simply of a restoration of the status quo. I believe that that answers all the hon. Gentleman's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has not dealt with all the issues. On the drafting issue raised by the Law Society, I agree that different draftsmen would probably use different methods. A decision on that may have to be made, which is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sought to establish the commercial logic for the six-year and two-year periods. The object of the exercise is supposed to be to get loan relationships into line with commercial logic in the real world. Our concern is that the legislation is unlikely to achieve that. The Minister said that the Government simply use tax law in assessing the six-year period, which seems extraordinary given that the objective was to move away from a tax law-based criterion to a commercial reality criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is no point in attacking the Government on the use of the six-year period because they have now changed it in favour of the two-year period. The Economic Secretary said that the various organisations regarded that as satisfactory. Does she mean that that is what they preferred or that it was a compromise that emerged out of consultations between those organisations and the Treasury—so that it is not a question of what they wanted, but of the best they were going to get, given that they were not in a strong bargaining position? If that is what happened, where is the commercial logic in that? What connects it to the commercial realities in which companies operate? The same applies to the figure of 30 per cent. that the hon. Lady said emerged out of her negotiations with the BBA; did the BBA recommend that figure or did it come from the Treasury? What is its commercial logic? Do the Government seek a compromise based on the lowest common denominator between the Treasury and a professional organisation or do they want a realistic commercial logic? If it is the latter, members of the Committee should be told what that commercial logic is in regard to the two-year period and the 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of venture capital disincentives, the hon. Lady seemed to be saying that if we looked at the way in which we dealt with schedule 8 and then at clause 22 and the clause we are discussing and then put them all together, we could show that there is not a level of deterrence in the way in which investment might take place. Again, I refer to the representations from Freshfields. The Minister appeared to suggest that schedule 8 shows that there will be no deterrence sale and that the complexity will not cause companies to be caught in the Kafkaesque situation that I have described. But the Freshfields submission warns that that will happen. It states, in connection with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
paragraph 12 of schedule 8, that the definition of the term "tax advantage" is too wide. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 'just and reasonable apportionment' approach to disallowance does not fit comfortably into self-assessment.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The provision is asymmetrical in that debits can be disallowed in whole or in part but if, for example, the debt is waived by the creditor, the whole amount waived will have to be brought into account …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The definition of 'tax advantage' in section 709 forms part of legislation the principal purpose of which is to prevent the extraction of profits from companies in a non-taxable form (rather than through dividends). It is not at all obvious that it is the correct definition for legislation which focuses, in the main, upon the prevention of artificial deductions.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is not clear why the Revenue have rejected the concept enshrined in section 787 of the Taxes Act 1988. Admittedly that section has not … been the subject of any reported cases, but it is a useful backstop for the Revenue if they consider that artificial schemes for obtaining interest deductions are being utilised.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A company could be caught by the new paragraph 12 even if the person who wanted to secure a tax advantage was some other person, such as the lender; and the paragraph could apply even if the company did not know anything about another person's desire to secure a tax advantage."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that I have extended the criticisms of schedule 8(12) into a discussion of clause 79, but the combined impact of the clause, new clause 22 and schedule 8 raises anxieties about whether the complexity of the measures might amount to a disincentive to venture capitalists. I accept that the Government do not intend that disincentive to exist, but the problem may occur anyway, as the representations that we have received suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain unconvinced that the Minister has dealt with the question about privatisation that I raised earlier. I shall give her another opportunity to do so. In her previous reply, the Minister referred to companies A, B, C, D and G and H and so on. I accept that a milk marketing board may not be linked directly to Railtrack, but various companies in the railway industry may well be so linked. Why are such companies not to be placed on the same tax law basis as other companies in the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From a sedentary position the Minister says that the Government intend to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman has got it wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I shall let the Minister reply for herself. But what about the links between the parts of other companies that were broken up on privatisation? The gas, electricity and water industries used to relate to each other as businesses. If the provisions of the Bill were to apply to the privatisation of those industries now, it is not clear that they would be in exactly the same competitive position as other companies that have never been in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some doubt remains about the effect of the Bill, and I hope that the Minister can reassure me on that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the hon. Gentleman asked me about the proposed change from six years to
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
two years. I remind him that six years is commonly used as a period in tax law. We started with that period for the same reason that we used the common accounting procedure of accruals. Every other proposal in the Bill tries to fit in with the common norm. We were told quite quickly that the six-year period with which we started would be unnecessarily long to provide the required avoidance. We decided on two years as the test for connection as a consequence of discussions with the Confederation of British Industry. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire will recall that I told him that business suggested the two-year period because it is well recognised in business that if one has no such rule, it is possible for a company or a group of companies to arrange their affairs in such a way that they could split apart and obtain relief unreasonable in terms of Exchequer protection. Therefore, we wanted a commercial time period to provide a reasonable compromise by ensuring that business did not consider itself unnecessarily constrained and that the Exchequer was not left open to avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we decided on two years—it was as a consequence of the CBI's comments as well as those of the Chartered Institute of Taxation. Those organisations said that two years was a reasonable compromise; they accepted that there had to be some anti-avoidance provision but claimed that six years was too long as it would allow considerable scope for avoidance. They proposed two years and we accepted it. We have made the changes in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point relates to why the six-year period was chosen originally. The object of the exercise was to put taxation on a commercial basis. To begin on the basis of previous tax law is not how the issue should have been approached. It should have been approached by going out to businesses, consulting on what ought to be done, and framing the law to accommodate the reasonable demands of the economic realities. It seems as if the Government are reluctant to enter into a consultation process again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rather unnecessary point. To say that we want an anti-avoidance provision, but to leave blank the time period for such provision is an unacceptable way to undertake consultation. One introduces a reasonable time period and goes from there. We are endeavouring to stop groups of companies from playing games, which is a perfectly reasonable aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the new clause, I can only repeat that it has been tabled to provide the flexibility required by those who are affected. We came up with the commercial logic of a 30 per cent. limit because companies are unlikely to hold more than 25 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire raised various points about Freshfields. The ground has been gone over with various representative bodies and I must tell the Committee that they did not raise those points. That is because we covered the ground that concerned those bodies through the amendments to the clause and elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of whether tax advantage was too wide and whether it fitted with self-assessment, there is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
clash. That links with the remarks that I just made: many of the points raised deal with history, whereas the Bill deals with the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that exact point, the representations are not old; they are dated 29 February.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that trying to describe the issue relating to privatised companies in words when the best course would be to have a diagram, is rather difficult, but I shall have another go. All concerns that are or have been under the control of one Secretary of State—for example, the Secretary of State for Transport—would, without amendment, be connected with another. There may also be a risk that companies that have been controlled by a different Secretary of State would also be connected. That is how we arrive at the absurd position of British Rail being connected to the Milk Marketing Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been put to us that a question mark hangs over the connection rules if, as in some cases, the Government require a Government controlled body to set up a number of separate companies before privatisation. I shall return to my A and B analogy, with A being the Milk Marketing Board and B being Railtrack. Railtrack controls several other companies, but the connection that would be broken would be the connection between Railtrack and the Government and not that between Railtrack and any of the other companies that it controls. If we broke those other connections, we would be giving an unacceptable commercial advantage. The anomaly is that one totally disparate organisation is connected to another totally different organisation simply because now or at some earlier stage Government stood between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 180.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are technical and make the rules for changes of accounting methods work properly. They will ensure that where there is a change of accounting method, the computational rules will work as intended. The clause is designed to enable companies to follow their accounting entries when following normal accounting practices and the accounting method is changed either from accruals to mark-to-market, or vice versa.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received representations from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. It says that amendments Nos. 179 and 180 are designed to recast clause 81 so that debits and credits originally booked under the accounting method are left undisturbed, and thus in the right accounting period, with the clause computing any debit or credit that has fallen out of account or been double taxed and treating this as a one-off debit or credit in the second period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Chartered Accountants is uncertain whether amendment No. 180 achieves its purpose. By concentrating on the new clause 81(4B) on capital values, it seems to cause the interest attributable to the accruals basis period to drop out of account altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of a straightforward disagreement with the Institute of Chartered Accountants. We believe that, as drafted, the clause accommodates all eventualities. The subsection deals with a change from a mark-to-market to an accruals basis of accounting. It ensures that for the accounting period in which the change takes place an adjustment is made for the difference between the opening market value and the closing value for the same period calculated on an accruals basis. Because of the difference between our interpretation of the clause and that of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Inland Revenue will write to the institute explaining how the clause works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that that letter will be copied to members of the Committee and that any confusion will be dealt with in the guidance so that others may be aware of the circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Paragraph 122 of the submission on clause 81 from the Institute of Chartered Accountants states:

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that there have been lengthy representations from the Law
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
Society which do not seem to have been dealt with, although I may be mistaken. They relate to subsection 1(c), (b), (e) and (f). Maybe the Minister can reassure me that they have been dealt with, so I do not have to go through them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that the clause works entirely appropriately as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the Minister cannot reassure me that the Law Society's concerns have been dealt with, so I shall outline them to the Committee. Its submission says that clause 83 (1)(c)
	<br><blockquote><p>"appears to prevent many convertible securities from falling within this clause. Clause 83 applies to an asset if, inter alia, 'the extent to which shares may be acquired under [the conversion or exchange right] is not determined using a cash value which is specified in that [right] …'. But, in a typical convertible stock, the holder will be entitled to acquire shares at a fixed price, which may be subject to adjustment in the event of changes in the capitalisation of the company. This is surely a 'cash value'; it is certainly a cash amount."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society then gives an example. Condition 5(A) of the Great Portland Estates plc. 9½ per cent. convertible unsecured loan stock 2002 provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"each Stockholder shall have the right to convert the whole or any part (in amounts or integral multiples of £1 nominal) of his holding of stock into fully paid ordinary share capital of the Company … at the rate (subject to adjustment as set out in the Trust Deed) of £18.1818 nominal of ordinary share capital for every £100 nominal of stock converted…"</p></blockquote>
That appears to the Law Society to fall outside subsection 1(c) and to prevent that convertible loan stock from being an asset to which clause 83 would apply. The problem stems from the concept of a cash value; the Law Society believes that the provision would achieve the desired result if it read
	<br><blockquote><p>"the value of the shares that may be acquired under that provision is not determined using an amount which is specified."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society says that subsection (1)(b) is limited to assets that are convertible to shares in a company and should be extended to those that are convertible to other securities which are assets to which clause 83 applies. It also says that provision should be made to preserve the treatment of exchangeable securities where the underlying pool of shares known as the exchange property becomes represented by other assets, for example, cash or another company's debts, as a result of a takeover. The Law Society says that subsection (1)(e) causes difficulty because a convertible security, issued to a person who, for any reason, is unlikely to exercise the conversion right, may be "tainted" although that would not normally be apparent to a subsequent holder. All the convertible securities that come into existence at a particular time should be looked at together for the purposes of the test in subsection (1)(e) so that if the issue is on commercial terms—having a conversion right that is not essentially spurious—the test will be satisfied for the whole issue. The Law Society then asks why subsection (1)(f) is needed and whether it would not be possible, in the light of clause 95(2) to dispense with it and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"to which the company is party for the purposes of a trade carried on by it"</p></blockquote>
at the end of the paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
A similar point is made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. I accept what the hon. Lady said about its views on those matters, but in its original representations it said that it is not satisfactory that, for both companies and individuals, the gain realised on disposal of a convertible security issued at a discount will be taxed wholly as income. It suggests that income elements representing the accruing discount or premium should be calculated and taxed as income, the balance remaining within the chargeable gains regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is about convertible securities, which can be treated both as debt and as equity. Within that uneasy position lie many of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. In effect, debt is in the loan relationships regime, but equity in the capital gains tax regime. Convertibles can be in one or the other. Convertibles sometimes follow the trend of the underlying securities and sometimes do not. The clause therefore introduces a test. The specific test that has to be applied to a convertible is whether there is more than a neglible likelihood that it will be exercised. That test is written into the legislation, with the requirement that convertibles should not be issued at a significant discount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could make life much more complicated than that, but we must ask whether we want convertibles to continue. The answer is that because they are a useful way for companies to raise money, they must be allowed to continue. We could hang all sorts of conditions round them, but that would prevent a convertible continuing. We could also make a specific set of judgments, but even if we did so someone would always find a way round them. We have therefore followed the advice of a top City adviser and specified that there should be a "more than negligible likelihood" that it would be exercised. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has not raised those points with us again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has asked whether the provision will work. That is a matter of interpreting the law, and the Government say that it does work. The Law Society is still concerned because, although it agrees with our aims, it is unsure that the Bill works as it is drafted. The Revenue is, therefore, meeting representatives of the Law Society to go through our interpretation with them. We shall give the relevant guidance if it is necessary, but we do not think that it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 322, in page 56, line 26, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless it is one the disposal of which by the company would fall to be treated as a disposal in the course of activities forming an integral part of a trade carried on by the company.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 238, 239, 323, 240, to 242, 221, 324, 243, 325 to 327 and 223.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to explain the amendments. Clause 84 concerns the special rules for loans that are linked to chargeable assets. The clause and the amendments are about keeping what needs to be out of the new rules out and ensuring that what should be in is in. I appreciate that they are grouped as one on the selection list, but they fit into two groups. The first—Government amendments Nos. 322 to 325, 327, 221 and 223—relates to convertible and index-linked securities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For most debt, the new rules provide that all income, profit and losses should be dealt with as income for tax purposes. Some types of debt are, however, hybrids between loans and assets that come within a capital gains code. One example is a bond that may be exchanged for shares—we have, indeed, just spoken about convertibles. For securities that are linked to assets in that way, profits and losses will fall within the capital gains regime because of changes in value, while the interest will fall under the new rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, the matter of financial traders, which are companies that buy and sell bonds and shares as part of their usual day-to-day activity. They are, therefore, a special case. Tax law treats the profits and losses that they make from dealing in investments as being of an income, rather than a capital gains, nature because such traders make their income from buying and selling bonds and shares. We must preserve that position under the new provisions, and the first group of amendments does that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second group of amendments ensures that the clause's provisions are right. Movements in the value of bonds should fall within the capital gains regime, like movements in the value of the assets to which the bonds are linked. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire will be interested to know that the amemdments were suggested by Ernst and Young.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify which amendments we are discussing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing amendments Nos. 238 and 243, which are a response to representations from Ernst and Young. They ensure that there is an enforceable debt in general law. There may have to be a nominal price on such bonds even if the value of the assets to which they are linked goes to zero. The amendments ensure that if there is a nominal repayment it will not prevent these bonds from falling within the capital gains regime. We have always intended them to come within the capital gains regime and we have amended the clause to ensure that they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary will be pleased to hear that I shall be brief. With regard to amendment No. 322, what is to stop someone setting up a company whose aim is to deal with the disposal to avoid the provisions?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In practice, people can always attempt to avoid legislation. We have tabled an amendment to the clause to ensure that legitimate activities can continue. The question was whether legitimate activity could continue in financial trade without the amendments. The worry is the reverse of that which the hon. Gentleman expressed. The worry was that a financial trader might find himself in the wrong tax regime. We have therefore tabled an amendment to put him unequivocably in the right tax regime as he was in the past and as we intend he should be in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure whether one of the Law Society representations has been dealt with. It made a representation initially saying that it was not convinced that the clause worked. It stated:

	<br><blockquote><p>"Suppose a company borrows £100, the redemption amount being adjusted for changes in the FTSE-100 index. The index rises from 3.700 to 4.070, i.e. by 10 per cent. The amount to be paid on redemption is not £10 (which arguably is the amount determined by applying the 10 per cent. change in the FTSE-100 to the amount of the original loan…) but £110. Sub-clause (6) should be amended by replacing the words after 'is' in line I on page 57 with the words 'equal to the amount of the original loan from which the money debt arises increased or decreased by a relevant change in the value of chargeable assets'."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be pleased to hear that I welcome the clause as part of the proposed legislation to create and build up a gilt strips market, beginning in early 1997. I hope that it will make Government borrowing more competitive and drive down the interest that the Government have to pay on their borrowing. Can the Minister explain how the proposal will work, not only with regard to tax provision, but in general? What research has been done into the impact of the gilt strips market on Government borrowing, and especially the tax regime that will apply to it? Has analysis been carried out to ascertain what would have happened in recent years had there been a gilt strips market, which might have helped the Government with their current borrowing difficulties? What control and regulation of that market do the Government envisage? What, if any, are the tax implications of that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision will be enormously useful, not only for pension funds, which will be able to buy gilt strips to offset any payments they have to make, but for companies that have loan liabilities in future. It is what the Americans might call a win, win, win
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
situation. Everyone can benefit, especially in the long term, the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strips are gilts that do not pay interest; they have maturity rights. When stripped, a holder returns the gilt to the bank for an exchange of strips equal to the original gilt. That answers the hon. Gentleman's first point. Stripping is treated as a redemption of the gilt, followed by acquisition of strips for the purposes of accounts. That is the same as if the individual had sold the gilt and bought strips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the strips market is not simply that it helps Government funding but because markets in other countries are starting to have strips. We need to ensure the pre-eminence of London. That is why we have proposed a strip market in the form set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about tax changes. Discussions about the part of the Bill that we are considering began with that subject. The consultation was originally about methods of changing tax legislation to accommodate the gilts market. There is not point in going through the procedure again. It does not result in a loss of tax take, but in slightly different impacts as a consequence of where the tax bites. It is an excellent provision, and I commend it to everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
