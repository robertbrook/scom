	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, Mr. O'Hara, I welcome you to the Committee. You will be pleased to hear that your attendance here is likely to be shortlived as we do not expect the Committee to have many more sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments question the fundamental purpose behind the Bill. They are probing amendments, in which we seek to identify exactly what a liability might be. The Bill seeks to amend the duties of the Secretaries of State for Health and for Scotland so that they must exercise their statutory powers to transfer the liabilities of health service bodies that cease to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return in a few moments to the question of why the Government are seeking to guarantee such liabilities, but first I ask the Committee to examine closely the wording of clauses 1 and 2. The clauses provide that the Secretary of State, when exercising his powers, must
	<br><blockquote><p>"transfer property, rights and liabilities… so as to secure that all of its liabilities are dealt with"</p></blockquote>
I should like to know why that wording is used. The argument used by the Secretary of State and the Minister on Second Reading was that it was necessary
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
to tighten the wording of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 because it was open to misinterpretation. The Act also left doubt about what would happen when a health service body no longer existed. We have already considered what it means when such a body "ceases to exist", in the words of the Bill. We have not been satisfied with the Minister's responses on that point, and we hope that we shall receive a better answer at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the Minister claimed on Second Reading that the tightening of the law was essential and that taking away the Secretary of State's discretion to transfer the liabilities was absolutely vital. Conservative Members claimed that there was a loophole and that the Bill would plug it. Hon. Members should read the Bill carefully. We should like the Minister to explain what will happen to each of the Secretary of State's discretionary powers. The Committee will particularly want to know what will happen to the Secretary of State's powers in respect of the property and rights of former health service bodies. If there is a loophole in the powers regarding liabilities, does not that mean that the same loophole exists with regard to rights and properties? If so, should not that also be plugged?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is made plain in the notes on clauses which accompanied the Bill on Second Reading, although I accept that they do not constitute a statutory document. Note 8 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The property and rights will remain subject to the Secretary of State's discretion to transfer"—</p></blockquote>
the note goes on to limit that discretion—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the extent that they need to be transferred".</p></blockquote>
I wonder why that is. The Government were given a brief to produce what is effectively a cast iron bale-out clause to the private sector and any private finance initiatives. We must ask whether that is what the Government have done in the Bill and whether they still have discretion regarding rights and properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already considered the £5 billion that the Government have landed on the taxpayers' collective doorstep as a result of the risk-free contracting in the new health service private finance initiative. I should like us to consider the property rights that have not been transferred. As I said on Second Reading, in the worst case the private contractor could contract with a trust to build for free a new health-care facility, if he wanted to. A few cost overruns dropped in along the way could recoup the contractor's money and perhaps bankrupt the trust in the process. The Secretary of State is certain to pick up the tab. The Bill was introduced to underwrite such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what may happen if a contractor builds a useless facility. That is not beyond the bounds of possibility, as the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) can testify all too clearly. The Guy's hospital phase 3 building is three years behind schedule and five times over cost—18,000 variations have been made since the planning stage. In addition, an unknown bug is eating away at its copper
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
piping, £10 million worth of post-contractual changes have been needed and £500,000 was spent on legal bills in one year alone. The project director Mr. Graham Perry, described the phase 3 development as a "nightmare". In fact, it was so disastrous that, before his ennoblement by the Prime Minister, Sir Philip Harris, had demanded his £6 million back and refused to let the trust name the building after him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Philip Harris house saga holds an important lesson from which members of the Committee should learn. The building will never be used for its intended purpose. It may not be a white elephant, but it certainly is a white mouse. In an interview with the 	<i>Health Services Journal</i> on 2 November 1995, the project manager, Mr. Graham Perry, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The initial 'Approval in Principal' was unreal, but politically acceptable. It may be that at the moment some people have no choice but to play the game. If they had put the big figure first, the project wouldn't have happened."</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State rejected my assertion that private contractors would underbid to secure work, but Mr. Perry clearly supports my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interview, Mr. Perry also refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a lack of clarity, definition and control. The original sponsor was a new general manager with a purely medical background who had no contracting or construction experience whatsoever."</p></blockquote>
He adds that the manager's role was
	<br><blockquote><p>"frequently passed across to a number of similarly inexperienced and inappropriate individuals."</p></blockquote>
He states that the whole system made for
	<br><blockquote><p>"a dubious client control base."</p></blockquote>
The Guy's case provides a salutary example of what may happen. The Secretary of State may be left with property or rights that are as much liabilities as anything else, but he will have no obligation to transfer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read Mr. Perry's interview soon after taking over the Opposition's health portfolio. It puts into perspective the fragmentation that is taking place within the health service and the responsibilities that are being given to individual trusts. By that, I do not refer to the responsibility for the management of hospitals that has been given to hospital managers. I clearly support that, and I hope that all members of the Committee do too. I refer to the added responsibilities that have been given to managers. For example, they have had to learn how to negotiate salaries at a local level for the first time. In addition, clinicians have suddenly been given managerial status inside the trusts and they have to take decisions on major projects. At one time, such decisions would have been taken at a regional level by people professional in that role. Clinicians now have to take those decisions and their professional status means that, in certain circumstances, they are inadequately trained to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider what a liability constitutes. I hope that Guy's will be able to pull through its present problems, but in such cases a trust may go out of
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
business. In the case of Guy's, responsibility lies with a number of players involved in the contract, but we must decide whether that project constitutes a liability. If it is not deemed to be a liability under the Bill, the private sector and the banks will like that one bit. They have clearly arm twisted the Government into effectively gold plating liabilities, but they will wonder whether they have covered them all. Discretion will remain in terms of property and rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us whether there will be empty or part-finished PFI projects because the Secretary of State has decided not to transfer them? Or, in the case of rights, will new medical techniques be unused because the Secretary of State had decided to keep them in limbo?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister thought the question of the can of worms that the Bill is opening with regard to underwriting liabilities without discretion, whatever "liabilities" means as opposed to leaving discretion in properties and rights? Either the Secretary of State has discretion or he does not. This area, which has been left in limbo, should be cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more I read the Bill, the more it appears to be a lawyer's charter and a last-minute, rushed and panic measure. If the Bill goes unamended and unexplained, is there not likely to be another round of legal wrangling as well as further discussion of the words we debated in the first sitting, "ceases to exist"? I think that there might well be and that lawyers will once again be rubbing their hands over consideration what the transfer of properties, rights and liabilities means and what discretion lies where.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts will want to know what constitutes property, rights and liabilities. None of those terms is explained in the Bill and no attempt has been made to provide a schedule detailing which is which. All three remain vague and undefined. Again, I submit that our learned friends could have a field day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must tell the Committee in clear and unambiguous terms what is meant by a liability; whether property or rights will be classed as liabilities in future; and what measures he will put in place to ensure that he does not leave the Department open to endless litigation in the event of a health service body ceasing to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is able to address my concerns and to explain in detail why the loss of discretion on liabilities still remains in property and rights and what that will mean in practice when interaction takes place between the public sector and private finance, the risks run by which he purports to want to underwrite by bringing the Bill before Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Horam)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the hon. Members for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) for moving the amendment constructively. He seeks clarification, which is reasonable at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what, exactly, we mean by liabilities. He sought to explore the distinction
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
between liabilities and property and rights. The first distinction is that property and rights are usually considered assets, not a liability, and, therefore, can be treated differently from a liability. A liability is usually an organisation's contractual obligation. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State used the example of a contract for the supply of potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An organisation might have contracts with all manner of people to supply services to the hospital trust. It might have liabilities which stretch into the future, obliging it to buy those services for some time. Those would be liabilities for an organisation in the normal commercial sense—they would have been entered into with another commercial party and the organisation would be honour-bound to fulfil them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that under the PFI, somebody took over the design, building and operation of a hospital. We understand that that would be a liability if the contract was to run for a number of years. Let us also suppose that the hospital ceases to exist, for whatever reason. If the purchaser—fundholders, if they still exist, or the general practitioner commissioning system, if that becomes the norm—decides to go through another hospital, will such a liability, contracted into under the PFI, be underwritten even if patients are not sent to that hospital for treatment because they get a better deal at a neighbouring hospital?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am saying that at the beginning of that process, when a PFI arrangement is entered into, there will be contracts governing who does what. The private consortium may contract with the hospital trust to provide certain facilities such as management. If the trust, for whatever reason, is unable to meets its obligations, it will still have to honour those contracts. It should not be allowed to walk away from contracts that have been reasonably entered into. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health said on Second Reading, the public sector should not be allowed to behave like Barlow Clowes and simply walk away from a liability which has been properly entered into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local purchasers might decide not to purchase at St. Thomas's ear, nose and throat department, for example—if St. Thomas's has such a department, that is—but to go five miles down the road. The contract to manage that department could run for 15 years, but if it was no longer functioning after eight years because the purchasers had decided to purchase elsewhere, would the contract be honoured, although people were going to another hospital department for treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That would depend on the contract. If the organisation does not exist, its liability is taken over by another organisation—a trust, or whatever the Bill specifies. Contracts properly entered into by the original trust will be honoured. If, however, an organisation cannot meet its ordinary obligations,
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
the contract entered into originally will apply. That contract might specify that there will be a break point, for example, in the facility's management. After two years, the facility's management may cease unless the contract provides that it shall carry on. That is a break point, which limits the contract. It is a question not of having an open-ended obligation but of meeting the contractual obligations that the original trust entered into—no more, no less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about Guy's hospital phase 3, and the overrun of costs. That is an interesting example. It happened under existing conventional public finance. The point about the private finance initiative is that when a trust—St. Thomas's and Guy's trust in this instance—entered into a building arrangement with a private contractor, it would transfer part of the risk to the contractor, saying, "You will erect this building for £56 million. In so far as you exceed that cost, you take the risk." In practice, the risk taken by the public sector and the risk to the taxpayer will be less than it would be under the existing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chelsea and Westminster is one of a number of hospital building contracts that has been conventionally financed through the public sector. When problems arose, the taxpayer had to pick up the Bill in an open-ended way and bear the cost of finishing the project, whatever it was. That risk would be limited under the PFI by the original contract. Does the hon. Gentlemen understand my point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the Minister. It is because of the overruns and everything else that goes with the PFI that we are in Committee now. Where there have been overruns—and there have been many in the past—the state has renegotiated contracts anyway. Is the Minister saying that that would never happen in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that in a privately financed contract of the sort that we envisage, contracts will be—and are already being—entered into that define the responsibilities and liabilities of the two parties. That will mean that the risk to the public sector—to the taxpayer—will be limited by the contract between the trust and the private supplier. That is a huge benefit. In the case of Guy's it might have meant all the overrun being taken on by the private builder who contracted to build Guy's phase 3 or provide the facilities for it. At the moment the public sector has to pick up the bill for the overrun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being present at the beginning of the proceedings, Mr. O'Hara. I came in the Room as the Minister was beginning to respond to points about Guy's. His arguments for PFI are founded on a fundamental misapprehension. There are arguments to be made in its favour, but they are not the ones that the Minister made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present arrangement, if Guy's and St. Thomas's hospital trust, or its predecessor, the Guy's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
and Lewisham trust, or that body's predecessor, the local health authority, entered into a contract with the builders Higgs and Hill to build phase 3 Higgs and Hill would be liable in damages if it defaulted, as it would under any other building contract. The public sector is protected 100 per cent. in such circumstances, if it has got the contract right, as under any other contract where the other party is at fault. There should not necessarily be any financial gain involved in transferring the contract to build elsewhere in the private sector. A contract is necessary. In other words, the trust needs a contract with the private sector developer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The intervention is becoming rather long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. O'Hara. I am seeking to make only one point, and I shall briefly conclude it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A contract with a developer entails exactly the same risk and liability—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not? The PFI advantages are entirely different from the contractual protection of the local hospital trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a contract now, of course, where the public sector buys services such as construction of a building from a private constructor, and that is, of course, subject to the usual commercial rules. However, the point of the PFI is that a consortium is formed not only to build or supply a particular service to a hospital, but to build, and supply facilities to, a major part of the hospital. It contracts to do so for a certain sum over a certain period. If it exceeds the cost, it bears the risk. That does not happen in the case of Chelsea and Westminster and it will not happen in the case of Guy's and St. Thomas's, where, in the end, the taxpayer, through the public sector—the NHS trust —will have to make up for things going wrong, costs being overrun, and the lack of a complete hospital for the original price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of PFI is the transfer of risk from the public to the private sector. There would be no point in private finance arrangements if that were not so, because public money is cheaper than private money and to that extent there would be an advantage in wholly financing the new hospital from public funds. However, private finance gives a certainty about the cost to the taxpayer that cannot be obtained from the existing, conventional arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of your earlier concern about lengthy interventions, Mr. O'Hara, and I shall make only one point in explaining why the Minister is incorrect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under present arrangements, any hospital can enter into a contract that limits its absolute liability,
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
stipulating that it will pay the contractor no more than, say, £50 million, £100 million or £150 million, and that any cost above that will be the responsibility of the contractor. There is no difference if the entire contract for building and running is transferred. Everything depends on the terms of the contract. That is not the advantage of PFI. That is where the Government's view is flawed. Its advantage is, perhaps, the possibility of washing one's hands of management responsibility. There is no theoretical or necessary difference, however, between the contractual liabilities of NHS trusts in one arrangement or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is, because the consortium in a PFI contract will, precisely, involve management as well as construction. I have spoken about supply of facilities. That is management. If, for example, the expected revenue is not received, the private consortium will bear the risk. That is the point of the PFI. It is a combination. To put it another way, it is not a matter, as it is at present, of build and forget. At present, a building is built and the builder goes away and forgets about costs and liabilities. Perhaps costs are greater than were originally foreseen, and the difference is borne by the taxpayer. Under PFI, the contractor will construct the building and be involved in the continuing management of its supplies and maintenance. Therefore, in so far as costs and revenue do not work out as planned, he will bear the risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that continuing management costs would be transferred to a contractor from hospital trusts. But there would be no management costs for any of the relevant hospitals—management of the blessed things would not have started. Construction costs, however, could be protected under PFI entirely, as they are under the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong because in practice it is not possible totally to separate the management of a building from its construction. It may have happened in the past, with, in some instances, calamitous results. It is better to combine the two. Those who both build and maintain a building will take care about design and construction and about what will be necessary to maintain it. There will be a responsibility and incentive to build so as to minimise maintenance costs. There is a connection, and the hon. Gentleman is wrong to claim otherwise on the basis that management of the building does not begin until it is finished. Of course it does not, but none the less all aspects of the building should be thought about at the design stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rother Valley was speaking about liabilities. Liabilities, as I have said, are determined by contracts properly entered into by a trust and the private sector. The point of the Bill is that the public sector should not be able to walk away from such liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make my point clear I shall give an example showing why it is necessary to retain a certain discretion over property and rights, and why the clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
is phrased as it is. Two trusts that are combined to form a new one, and therefore cease to exist, or are dissolved, to use the term that the hon. Gentleman prefers, may have owned a parcel of land that could be sold to raise money for the new trust, or for the NHS as a whole. It might be decided to do that, both in the general interest of keeping down the running costs of the new trust, which would thus not take on any debts associated with the land as part of its overheads, and because the trust does not need the land. The trust and the NHS would benefit from the land, the sale of which could be put towards new hospital building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong if the Bill provided that in such a case property had to be transferred with liabilities. That would be the effect of the amendment tabled by the Hon. Member for Rother Valley. it would make it necessary to transfer property and liabilities. In certain circumstances, which we cannot exactly envisage but which might well occur, it would be a mistake to do that, from the point of view of the economy of running the trust that was being set up. There might be, in certain circumstances, a difference between property and liabilities. Usually, property would be inescapably linked to liabilities—the whole lot could be transferred in one go, and that would usually happen—but there are circumstances in which that is not advisable. Therefore, the Bill is worded as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only the liabilities have to be dealt with; that is sufficient for our purposes—we do not need any more than that. If we tried further to constrain the Secretary of State, the Government or the national health service in the way that the amendment proposes, that might be to the disadvantage of particular trusts. We do not want that to happen. I understand why the hon. Gentleman seeks clarification of why there might be a distinction between property and liability. We have explored that, but the amendment might make managing the estate of the NHS more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. We should consider the words "ceases to exist" in the context of the dissolution of trusts. If the Calman report is being implemented, as the district medical officer suggests, moving facilities or ending a trust's responsibility for certain matters might make sense. The point which springs to mind from that is that there would not be such flexibility under PFI. Is it correct that there could not be such flexibility with property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what property the hon. Gentleman is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A hospital that has been built and is operated under the PFI.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The private consortium would build a hospital and then charge the trust for the services of the building and the facilities that go with it. In so far as that did not work out—should the whole adventure fail—it might be that, under the terms of the contract, on which the matter would clearly depend, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
consortium would have to bear the whole cost. The trust might have a contract under which it could walk away, saying, "Sorry, this hasn't worked out and we must have our arrangements with somebody else." Or the trust might ask for a different management for the buildings put up by the consortium because it is not satisfied with the current management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, all sorts of performance criteria will be built into a contract. If they are not met by the private supplier of facilities or the private maintainer of the building, a clause might be triggered under which the trust can say that what has happened is unsatisfactory, sack the private contractor and go with another contractor who will provide services at an acceptable price. There is that flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When trusts are being dissolved and then being put back together, the NHS is effectively being reshaped for its current needs. If a lot of hospitals were built under PFI, perhaps in the same locality, the flexibility to shift facilities between different trusts would be lost, as would the ability to provide a service which was unavailable when the original buildings and systems were established. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that would not restrict flexibility. The trusts would have the same flexibility as they have currently to transfer assets. That is matter for them. I doubt whether the private sector or even the trusts would over-supply an area with hospitals. If a private builder or facilities management company was studying the prospects for going into partnership with a trust, it would examine the situation in an area to discover whether there was a shortage or a surplus of supply. It would not, therefore, supply facilities where it thought that there was an unnecessary risk of there being too much supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the experience of the NHS in the past 20 years has been that of dealing with the problem of over-supply. The number of hospital beds needed has declined and will continue to do so. That is due to a number of reasons, including a shift from secondary to primary care and the development of new technology such as minimally invasive surgery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that if one enters into a private finance initiative deal to design, build, finance and operate a health facility, it is clear that that facility will be needed for the period of the contract. We cannot tell what technologies the health service will be using in 20 years, what development facilities will be needed, or what mix of clinicians and others will be needed. Yet the Minister is setting up a framework in which the NHS will be unable to walk away from commitments that it has made to a private supplier to have such services supplied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, it will be able to walk away. It cannot do so now. At present, if the NHS builds a hospital, it takes money from the taxpayer's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
pocket to do so. Under the PFI an NHS Trust can walk away from an arrangement if it does not work, depending on the terms of the original contract. The NHS cannot walk away from its liabilities but it can walk away from the contract, if it does not work to its satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is entirely right in saying that the history of the NHS has been one of change and, to some extent, reduction of unnecessary supply. We need flexibility because we cannot see into the future. The PFI increases flexibility because the arrangements will be more flexible and imaginative. For example, at St. James's hospital, medical facilities are being built separate from the wards, which are, in effect, an hotel. If facilities need to be changed because medicine changes, new facilities can be plugged in and the wards can stay exactly the same. Those techniques being used by the private sector have been built in and there is, therefore, greater flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the public sector is not saddled with the whole building. At present, if we build something and it becomes a white elephant, the original cost and any debts associated with it fall on the public sector. Under the PFI that need not be the case because there may be a break clause in the contract that enables the trust to walk away from the building if it decides to have different arrangements in future. That is increased flexibility. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that we need increased flexibility, and that is one reason why we have introduced the PFI.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the critical point is in the Minister's phrase, "there may be a break clause in the contract". If there is a break clause, there is no need for the Bill, and if there is not, the Bill places on the Secretary of State liabilities from which as the Minister has been telling the Committee, the PFI will allow the public sector to escape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is arguing in circles. The Government set up the PFI in the expectation that they would transfer risk to the private sector. They found that the private sector was not prepared to take risks on the terms offered. The Government, therefore, reducing the risk to the private sector to enable private finance to be brought into the health service to match the reduction in public sector capital spending in last November's Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong in every respect. I am sorry that he got the first point right and everything else wrong. Contracts should be honoured. Any commercial or public sector organisation would want to honour its contracts. The contracts are different from conventional public financing arrangements. Some contracts have a break clause, and that is the whole point. Clearly contracts must be honoured, but a break in them may enable a trust to walk away from arrangements if they are not satisfactory from the trust's point of view. In a conventional case it could not do that, so that is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
change in the direction of greater flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On risk, the right approach is to enable the parties to an agreement to take those risks that they are best able to manage and that are appropriate for them. For example, a firm in the private sector takes the risk of not performing a contract satisfactorily and, therefore, losing the contract. Similarly, the revenue supplied for a hospital's use may not be as great as originally envisaged. That is another of the legitimate commercial risks that the private sector is well equipped to accept. The private sector will take and is taking such risks. More than £200 million is in PFIs, and they involve such risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong, however, to ask the private sector to bear the risk that the Government may simply walk away from the liabilities that they are contractually obliged to honour in normal commercial circumstances because of a change that they may make for political or other reasons. The public sector should not do that, and the Bill will prevent it from doing so. That is the point that is behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, if the NHS thinks that it has a white-elephant facility, it can dispose of it. It may lose much money in doing so, as the disposal of Yorkshire regional health authority's headquarters in Harrogate shows. It spent more than £3 million in improvements in the past eight years, but the headquarters were sold for less than that. At present, the NHS can say that a facility is no longer required and it can decide to dispose of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point. It is a problem for the NHS. Under the PFI, however, it is a problem for the private sector. That is the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is a problem for the private sector, the Bill is not needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall develop the point slightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister described situations in which a contract can be terminated because a private supplier is failing to meet quality standards. I am sceptical about the Minister's argument because I served on a health authority that faced extreme difficulties in making a private cleaning contractor meet its quality standards. The health authority had to spend much more money than it had ever anticipated in supervising and monitoring the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A contract may be terminated if a contractor underperforms, but the Minister has not explained how the NHS can break a contract if the health need of the service changes because of the development of new health technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the trust was negotiating a contract, it will have given itself the maximum flexibility. It will have considered that issue and so organised the contract that the possibility of technological change is taken into account to some extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that if a private contractor provides a service of inappropriate quality, the contract can be terminated. He has not explained how that can be done with a design, build, finance, operate—DBF0—package, in which a contractor has provided the capital building as well as management and services. The Minister says that in those circumstances it is possible for the Government to get off the hook. I am not convinced by his argument, but the Minister also said that it is possible for the Government to get out of their liability to make payments after any conceivable change in technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between contracts and liabilities. Liabilities are contracts properly entered into and must be honoured. A contract is negotiated according to the requirements of a trust. Therefore, it will be possible to build in all sorts of flexibility that cannot be built in now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me draw an analogy. An insurance company may operate from an office building, but it does not need to own the building. It may decide to take a lease, which terminates at a certain point and gives the right to renegotiate at a certain point. Therefore, the owner of the lease is responsible for the building. If the insurance company goes bankrupt, the owner must find a new tenant. It is not a question of the insurance company having to find a new building, because responsibility for the building lies with the owner. In this case, the owner is a private company, not the health service. Therefore, the health service has much more flexibility in deciding how to concentrate on its clinical services—after all, the purpose of the service is to deliver clinical services—and can renegotiate its lease, change to another building, or do whatever it thinks is right. That flexibility exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To follow the example through, what hold would the owner of a building's freehold have over a private insurance company that went bankrupt? It would be one of many creditors. It would presumably let the building again, but it would not have the security that the Government intend to offer the private partner under the private finance initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of a contract is that both sides agree to it. In this case, a contract will probably be a compromise between the need of the private sector to make a profit and the needs of the trust, such as flexibility and its view of what may happen in future. If an organisation ceases to exist, that was not agreed in the contract, so the liabilities of that organisation must be dealt with fairly. The Bill seeks to ensure that those liabilities are dealt with fairly. It says that the Secretary of State does not have the discretion simply to walk away from those liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give some examples of liabilities that go beyond the contract, to which the NHS, as a corporate whole, would be committed—whatever might happen in an individual trust?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contract would be with an individual trust. There would be no corporate contract as such. There may be a contract for facilities management, maintaining the building or supplying services. A contract can cover everything that is involved in setting up an estate, so that a trust can supply a clinical service from that estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens if there is a contract to provide an in-patient unit for the mentally ill, for example, and policy changes mean that fewer beds for the mentally ill are needed? The Minister is suggesting that although a trust can renegotiate the terms of a contract and can try to convert the building into a day centre for the mentally ill, it cannot simply say to the private supplier, "We have been buying in 24 in-patient beds for the mentally ill, but we no longer require them." The trust is not in a position to withdraw NHS resources from a facility that it once needed but no longer needs. It cannot spend that money on what it chooses, buying from a supplier that it chooses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it can withdraw—to the extent that that envisaged in the original contract. The hon. Gentleman has got into a fundamental muddle about contracts and liabilities. Contracts are agreed by two parties—they set up the framework. If a trust is dissolved and liabilities occur, they must be dealt with fairly. The public sector should not behave in a way that private contractors go bankrupt simply because my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has decided that a trust should be dissolved. Contracts must be honoured. That is all the Bill is saying—and why it is called the National Health Service (Residual Liabilities) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Bill has not been enacted and there are no contracts in view. However, some contracts are surely envisaged by the Minister and his Department. Would not it be helpful to publish a contract or model contract that would cover the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) about how a trust making such a contract could get out of it if circumstances changed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are contracts in the NHS now—hundreds and thousands of them. The bill simply specifies that those contracts must be honoured and that in no circumstances, if a trust ceases to exist, can the Secretary of State simply welsh on those contracts and walk away. That is sensible from the point of view of how the public sector treats small companies, which have often had a bad deal over contracts not honoured and late payments from the public sector. There is an obligation to deal properly and fairly with the private sector when it delivers goods and services in good faith under contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there are lots of contracts now, but there are not many for PFI arrangements, which will lease buildings for many years. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
for York is that circumstances may change and a trust may need to get out of a contract. It is incumbent on the Minister to publish guidelines, to enable trusts to make provision for changes in medical care so that they can get out of contracts. The legal brains at the Department should be set to work on that task before trusts enter into contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the PFI evolves, there will be a more standardised approach. The hon. Gentleman does not want to keep reinventing the wheel. Parts of a contract will become standard. If that is what the hon. Gentleman is saying, I agree. Eventually, standard parts of the contracts will become clear and will be put into new contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but I am worried that contracts will be made by trial and error. In the meantime, many trusts may enter long-term contracts, committing large amounts of public money, and will make a lot of mistakes that may be serious. The Minister and his Department would help by bringing out model guidelines to warn trusts what to beware of in contracts. Trusts could at least then minimise their mistakes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that trusts are guided by the NHS executive and that general guidance about contracts is issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the question posed by the hon. Member for York, and given the Government's philosophy of a market in the health service, why should private contractors in an NHS trust be put in a better position than a private contractor would be in with another private contractor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The public sector has an obligation to behave properly towards the private sector. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, the public sector should not behave like a shyster capitalist. I would be surprised if the hon. Gentleman argues that it should. The NHS never has behaved that way and has always honoured obligations. The Bill merely ensures that it is statutorily necessary to honour those obligations. Both sides of the Committee would surely agree that is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not argue with that, but I want the Minister to put on the record what the difference should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second, more important question arises from the Minister's response. Under the Government's definition, only liabilities have to be passed to the Secretary of State, another NHS trust or health authority or a special health authority on a trust ceasing to exist. Only for liabilities is that obligatory rather than discretionary. In relation to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), what would prevent the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
from deciding to dissolve a trust—it could be dissolution as well as amalgamation—and not only to transfer the liabilities to one of those four bodies but all property and all rights entirely to the private sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under a private finance initiative, whereby St. James's hospital in Leeds or the Guy's and St. Thomas's hospital trust was given over to a private company to manage and provide services, what would prevent the Secretary of State form saying that everything should be handed over completely to the private sector, because the property and rights would be transferred and only the liabilities would return to the Secretary of State? That would effectively privatise the hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would prefer it if members of the Committee do not confer with members of the public from inside the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. O'Hara.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it was decided that a trust should sell a piece of land—the example that I gave to begin with—the trust would get a price for that land and it would have been decided that it was in the trust's best interests to sell it. My objection to the amendment is that it would prevent any property being sold by the national health service when a trust ceased to exist, even though it was in the interests of that trust or of the wider NHS that a parcel of land be sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, as a result of care in the community there are now many old mental asylums throughout the country that are empty or under-utilised. They are part of the estates of the national health service and can be used for other purposes—as residential property or a company headquarters, for instance. It is clearly of benefit to the health service to sell the property and use the money to provide new hospitals or hospital equipment. That would be good and we should not constrain it. The Bill does not do so, and the NHS has never been constrained from selling what it is in its interest to sell. It cannot, however, welsh on its liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I understand that clearly. Under PFI, and under the Bill if it is enacted, there remains a discretion for the Secretary of State as to where he transfers the properties and rights of a trust that ceases to exist. What is to prevent the Secretary of State deciding that the Guy's and St. Thomas's hospital trust should cease to exist and from transferring to a private consortium, if it was managing St. Thomas's over the river from here, the property and rights—the land and the right to health care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under PFI, the consortium would already own the hospital and would be providing the services.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could get into a debate about whether it was freehold or leasehold land, and obviously St. Thomas's was built under ordinary NHS provision, not under PFI. Perhaps I have conflated two questions. In general terms, under the Government's policy and present legislation, what is to prevent the Secretary of State deciding that a trust should cease to exist and transferring its property and rights to the private sector? What would stop the Secretary of State saying today that he would dissolve Guy's and Lewisham NHS trust, and transfer the liabilities to himself and the property and right to someone else? That trust's services would be entirely provided by the private sector and would have nothing to do with the Secretary of State for Health or the local NHS trust, which would no longer exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would transfer it to another trust. That is the point of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole thing, depending on what was owned by the private sector and what was owned by the public sector.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be right.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey, the Minister said that the whole thing would be transferred. In that case, why is the word "all" not allowed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about what may happen when a trust ceases to exist or is dissolved, when its liabilities must then be dealt with. The distinction that I have been trying to make in reply to the hon. Member for York is that there must be no confusion between the contract that has properly been entered into and the liabilities. Looking ahead, under PFI, the assets and rights of the trust will be transferred. In the case of Guy's—in the hypothesis put forward by the hon. Member for York—the building may be owned in the future by the private sector. In that case, the assets would not be transferred because they would be owned by the private sector. That is why the word "all" is inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned St. James's university hospital trust, in which, as he knows, the contract is due to be signed next month, if the Bill quickly completes its remaining stages. I want to be clear about what would be transferred if there were a
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
change to the trust. The Minister knows that there are proposals to merge the two hospital trusts in Leeds. I do not know whether those proposals will be approved, but they mean that St. James's trust, as it is presently constituted, has an uncertain future. What happens with the merger will affect the trust's decision to enter into a contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain why, if the contract is signed, every aspect of the contract that St. James's trust had signed would not pass to the new trust? The Minister will accept that the trust will want to consider the rationalisation of services. Although we do not need fewer services in Leeds, changes in the way in which services are delivered may lead to changes in the way that the trust wishes to use the property, and it must meet the obligations carried by the signature on the contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Contracts must be honoured. A new merged trust that may be formed out of the two existing trusts in Leeds must accept the contracts and be bound by their terms. That will be the case. If the trust decided to reconfigure two hospitals, it will be able to do that to the extent that it is allowed to by the contracts negotiated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contract at present envisages the transfer of land to Medipark Ltd or St. James's Leeds Ltd. That land will be with them for 25 years. Under current circumstances, that land will revert to the St. James's university hospital NHS trust after 25 years. However, I take it that it could revert to whatever body has taken the trust's place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go into detail about the case in Leeds. I am broadly familiar with the position, but the details are still a matter of negotiation for the various parties and they are proceeding very well. The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged in the past, he is looking forward to the new development, which will benefit the people of Leeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have strayed a long way from the original point, but I hope that I have clarified the distinctions between liabilities, property and rights. Normally, properties and rights are inextricably linked to liabilities, but there may be a case in which it is right to sell a piece of land that a trust does not need to make a new trust work or to reduce its debts and liabilities. I would not want to constrain a trust by adopting the words that Opposition Members have used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One way that we can understand the position is to consider specific examples. There are different facets to the contracts in Leeds. If I were a party to signing the contract and one of the partners involved in producing it. I would want to be sure that what the St. James's trust signs up to will be honoured whatever happens to the trust. That is especially important because negotiations are under way that may lead to the merger of that trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a second example. In the project I have described, provision has been made for 246 patients—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
166 national health service beds and 80 private beds. However, in the first 15 years the NHS has the option to take some of the 80 private beds as well. As that option will be in place for a set period, I presume that it could be transferred as a right. It is hard to envisage a right that could not be transferred if a contract is signed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go much further into this issue. However, in response to one of the points made by the hon. Gentleman in our previous sitting I add that another 830 car parking spaces will result from the PFI. Those spaces will be divided among the staff and the public. I have answered at least one of the hon. Gentleman's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister, but as I am visiting St. James's tomorrow, I shall do my best to meet someone who can enlighten me further, so that I can be clear about the other details. By the time we complete our discussion of the Bill, such knowledge will in our interests and those of the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by raising the more general but relevant issue of the capital investment needs of the national health service. The problems are especially acute because the Government have reduced public capital spending on the NHS from £1.8 billion this year to £1.4 billion in 1998–99—a fall of almost £400 million. That is greater than the £253 million increase in the PFI on NHS projects that, according to the Red Book, the Government anticipate for the same period. There mix of public sector investment and PFI investment will mean less capital altogether over the next three years, which is bad news for the NHS. Unable to increase public sector investment in the service, the Government are keen to do whatever they can to increase the flow of private sector investment through the PFI. I am not against the PFI in principle, but it is extremely important to ensure that the incentives given to increase the flow of private capital will not compromise the ability of the NHS to meet its fundamental aim of providing health intervention and care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate that we are not in any sense opposed to the PFI in principle. In the days when the Conservative Party in Government still peddled the Treasury line that the Ryrie rules on public sector investment were sacrosanct, the Labour party argued for alternatives. Those arguments did not first emerge in 1992 when the Government announced a PFI but they were made in the late 1980s by the current deputy leader of the Labour party, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) in relation to the use of private finance for infrastructure investment for the railways—the first example used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PFI is clearly most appropriate for areas of public sector provision with a clearly identifiable income stream—as in transport, through fare books or the ticket counter, or in public sector housing where
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
there is an income stream from rent. That gives confidence because investors know that money will come in to give them a fair return on their investment. The difficulty with the NHS is that it relies for its income stream almost wholly on decisions taken by the Treasury each year on account of the public sector spending round. Reassurances that the stream will not dry up are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's remarks still leave me extremely confused. He said that if it were a matter of the needs of the NHS changing, it would be possible for a trust to renegotiate—obviously at considerable cost to the NHS—the terms of a PFI deal through a design, build, finance and operate scheme. What if a private sector operator did not want to co-operate? What if too high a price were imposed for negotiating a change to the liability?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the trust can safeguard its position when it enters into a PFI contract by writing in a clause that will allow it to modify the terms of the contract in the light of foreseen changes in health needs over the period that the contract runs. But for it to be a viable contract, in most cases it will be for a period of 20 years or more—it certainly will be if it is a DFBO contract in which the capital cost of constructing a health facility, a hospital wing, a clinic or a community facility is included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must warn the Minister to think about what he is saying. One simply cannot predict what health needs will be in 20 years' time. One cannot predict how therapies will change and what mix of people and buildings will be needed. If the NHS minimises its liability by writing in a crystal-ball clause that says that it can negotiate changes in the package that it is buying at some future date—five, 10, 15, 20 years hence as health needs change—it will inevitably be constrained. It will not be an open-ended clause that the NHS trust can renegotiate as needs change because the private sector operator will want some terms of reference and some guarantees. It will not want the NHS trust to have an open-ended ability to vary the terms of the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once one starts trying to define the terms in which the contract may be varied so that the liability can be shifted from a health provision that is no longer wanted to one that is, one encounters the problem of predicting what will happen in future. If in 1976 one had tried to predict how surgery would have developed by 1996, I suspect that day surgery would have been omitted entirely. It would not have been possible to predict that minimally invasive surgery would be able to do what chop, clip and stitch did then. The huge developments in orthopaedics, with conditions being treated that were untreatable years before, would not have been foreseen. Many of the pharmaceutical developments would not have been envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Science moves at a pace with which science fiction or science prediction cannot keep up. The problem that I envisage with the PFI in the NHS is not that the terms
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
are too unattractive for private operators to wish to invest and so they need more reassurance, but that the Government are unclear about their priorities for private sector investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major survey of the NHS's information technology needs was carried out last year. It would appear to be a tailor-made candidate for the PFI. It is a non-clinical service which the Secretary of State says would be the priority for PFI investments. That survey by Cable and Silicon Bridge said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The short-term impact of the PFI on the market has been to stop major procurements in their tracks."</p></blockquote>
That has happened, and in other sectors too. The reason that it stops the investment process in its tracks is not because the investment terms for private sector partners are too punitive, but because the Government have adopted a blunderbuss approach. They are desperate for private sector investment to make good the shortfall in public sector investment, which came through as a result of the Budget cuts in capital spending in the NHS, and have said, "Come to us with any scheme you want. We'll test and run it. If we think it makes sense, we'll go with it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Setting up a PFI scheme costs the private sector investors a great deal of money. They have to carry out market research and put together a package. They want to know at an early stage the extent of the Government's commitment to a scheme, before money is spent on the project. I guess that for some big projects, such as Tommy's and Jimmy's, private sector partners are putting up £500,000 or more for the preliminary market research alone. Unless they have a good sign that the Government are really committed—this is a five-star scheme that they want to get up and running—there will not be the foundation to undertake the necessary development work. That is the problem with the PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, private sector companies will always say that they would like less-onerous terms to be imposed by the Treasury. It is natural business sense to want the best possible deal. The Bill makes the deal less onerous for the private sector investor, but that is not why the initiative has stalled in its tracks. It has stalled because of the blunderbuss approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are making the terms for the private sector investor more attractive—less risky—but that is not what is needed to kick-start the scheme. What is needed is clarity from the Government about their investment plans in the NHS. There is a classic example of an early project in south and west Devon to build a 12-bed community hospital for Dawlish which, at the time, was trumpeted as a pioneering model for the PFI. By the time the tenders came in, however, the scheme had been completely changed: it was not a community hospital. All the beds had disappeared from the plan and the budget had been slimmed down to an out-patient facility, x-rays and a minor casualty unit. The private sector thought that it was profitable for it to build and provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that stage, the health authority simply pulled the plug, saying that it wanted a community hospital, no
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
an out-patient facility. There was anger and resentment in the private sector, which had spent a great deal of money developing the scheme and was then told that it was not what was wanted in the first place. That was a major setback for the PFI's application to the health service which happened because the NHS, in that case the local health authority, was not clear about what it wanted. It had invited bids because it had perceived a need—indeed, there is a need—for a better primary health care response in the area, but it had not defined the need. The effect of that has been to increase caution among would-be private sector investors. They want to know the Government's priorities for investment in the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another potential problem is the conflict between the Secretary of State's statement that the PFI would be used for non-clinical NHS services and the flexibility that he provides for local decisions to be made by trusts. We need a clear answer from the Minister about whether the PFI is to be used for the provision of clinical services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the schemes that have gone through to date, particularly those for the provision of units to care for the mentally ill, appear to show that clinical services are being provided by the NHS, which conflicts with assurances given by the Secretary of State to the House. That is crucial. Opinion polls show that the majority of the British public have a deep-seated fear that the Government intend gradually to privatise the NHS. The Government deny that, but they have failed to take public opinion with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early days of applying the PFI to the NHS, we must make it clear that it covers support services, not clinical and patient-care services. Using the PFI to provide 800 car parking spaces in Leeds or elsewhere is appropriate. I would not wish car parking to be a priority for the NHS, given the sharply reduced amount of public sector capital that is available to it—cars cannot have priority over people. But I would be happy for the PFI to be used in such a way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wealden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously knows a great deal about the subject. He mentioned the application of modern technology to medicine. There is a growing burden on health services around the world, whether they are private, or partly assisted by the state. Britain has a unique system. It would be wrong to prevent the PFI from using money for clinical purposes and introducing, and perhaps advancing more quickly, some of the modern medical science that we need. We are backward in some respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a sensible and useful intervention, which highlights the need for Parliament to define clearly to the Executive the limits of the PFI in the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PFI has been used to lease scanners. I do not object to that in principle. I would however, wish to include specific safeguards in the lease of a piece of kit. First, a proper, technical option appraisal should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0806">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
carried out to ascertain whether purchasing a scanner constitutes a cost-effective use of NHS money. A scanner in a small hospital may detect only one of two treatable conditions a year. That is probably not a good way in which to spend hundreds and thousands of pounds of NHS money. If it is established, however, that a scanner is a health-need priority for a hospital, and it is provided through the PFI, those who operate it should be required to participate in the hospital's clinical community. They can thus co-operate with clinicians in providing data on which to base clinical research on the effectiveness of scanning in diagnosis. Those using the scanner services should be NHS clinicians who deal with problems and injuries of the brain, or obstetricians and gynaecologists, who deal with pregnancy and child birth. Those clinicians use the scanner as a tool. If a completely separate team operates the scanner, there could be a problem of a lack of holisticness—that is not the right word—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Holism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You know what I mean, Mr. O'Hara. We have not discussed that, or received guarantees about it. Therefore, I am apprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
If the Government were to say that until Parliament had made a wider decision, the PFI would be strictly limited to the provision of equipment or non-clinical services, I would be reassured. But we have not had that clear commitment—instead, there is confusion because of the statement made by the Secretary of State and the flexibility given to individual trusts. That makes me think that the purpose of the Bill is to drum up private finance in a pre-election period to try to make good the shortfall in the public capital expenditure that has affected the NHS as a result of last November's Budget cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason why the public and Opposition Members are apprehensive about the proposals is that statements made by leading Conservative supporters suggest that the PFI is, quite deliberately, being used by the Government as a stalking horse for privatisation of the NHS. There was recently a feature on the PFI in the 	<i>Public Policy Review.</i> Daniel Finkelstein, the man the Conservative party has hired to develop its policy ideas, wrote an article saying that the PFI's aim should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"to dissociate the state from its role as a provider of services for which it is ill suited, so that it can concentrate on being a guarantor of services for which it is uniquely suited."</p></blockquote>
A member of the Select Committee on the Treasury and—Civil Service wrote in the same publication that the PFI is
	<br><blockquote><p>"privatising the process of capital investment in our key public services from design to construction, to operation."</p></blockquote>
Those are clear statements from leading Conservative supporters. If those are not the Minister's views, he should slap down his Back Bench Colleague
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
and the party adviser at Smith square, and explain the Government's intention. According to those articles, the PFI is about privatisation. The public fear that it is the Government's intention to privatise the NHS, despite oft-repeated statements to the contrary. The evidence to date suggests that services that used to be provided by the NHS are now provided privately. Those services are principally care for the chronically ill, long-term care for the elderly, long-term care for people with learning difficulties, and long-term and acute care for those with mental illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a bizarre case in my local trust in York. The trust has agreed that physiotherapy staff can use its logo to advertise in the local newspaper for patients for a private physiotherapy clinic, and that they can use the trust's physiotherapy facilities to treat those patients privately. Why do people attend the Jorvik private physiotherapy clinic? Because the service is not available in adequate quantity for NHS patients who are not charged and who use the service during the day when the same kit and individuals provide NHS physiotherapy services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister address the genuine concern that the PFI is being used to change the relationship of the NHS to the public from a public service to a contract mish-mash of private services, some of which are paid for by public money and others which, although provided by trusts, are available only to private patients in return for a fee? National health service managers are themselves expressing concern about what is happening. Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts wrote recently.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let us not undermine the NHS by careless talk about restructuring the supply side outwith the NHS."</p></blockquote>
Yet that seems to be the Government's intention. Despite their reassurance that trust managers will have the foresight of Nebuchadnezzar and the negotiating skills of Attila the Hun, I do not believe that they could define their liability so as not to leave the NHS sometimes spending precious and limited resources on privately provided services for which there is no longer a clinical need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for York. I listened carefully to the Minister, who said that a trust cannot walk away from its liabilities under the contract that it has signed. My hon. Friend made a telling point when he said that there may be changes in medical circumstances in respect of health needs during the period of the contract that the trust signs. As they will be long-terms contracts, probably for 25 years—that is likely to be the minimum period for leasing a building—there is a real danger that expensive mistakes will be made in the PFI contracts by the trusts, which will be using public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I questioned the Minister about that aspect of the contracts and he said that the NHS Executive considers contracts and gives guidance on them. But that is in respect of much shorter contracts than those to which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0807">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
the Bill refers. I asked the Minister whether the NHS Executive was working on model PFI contracts which can be distributed to trusts and to district health authorities, and if they will be told about the pitfalls to avoid. If the NHS Executive is working on those contracts, the Committee should be aware of those model guidelines, as expensive mistakes could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appear to propose that the PFI contracts entered into by trusts will be negotiated in secret and signed without public consultation. There will be a grand announcement in the local press that a private consortium and a health trust have entered an agreement to build a hospital. Conducting negotiations in such secrecy is also a mistake. Expensive errors will be made over a period. All the draft contracts should, before being signed, be published. Perhaps they should go out for consultation, so that any errors or flaws can be brought to the attention of the trust managers before they finally enter into that long-standing commitment. I ask the Minister to take the argument on board and agree to a period of consultation and to the publication of draft PFI contracts for public scrutiny before they are entered into. If we do not do that we shall encounter some serious and expensive mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if things go wrong? It could happen. Long-term public expenditure commitments taken on by trusts could end up as the Minister's concern and prove to be of no value to the national health service, because of changed circumstances or health needs. Questions on that aspect of the matter remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he did not want to be constrained by the amendment with respect to liabilities because trusts might want to sell land. The problem with that approach is that trusts might be obliged—it is now Government policy—to seek private finance for any development that they wanted to undertake. They would be given no choice. Trusts that could not attract private finance by any other means might well have to use land to obtain it. That does not amount to giving trusts a choice. The selling of land might end as the giving away of land to secure private finance. It might happen against the trust's wishes, but as its only choice should it want development money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process will be expensive—and not just because of the mistakes that I mentioned such as wrongly worded contracts resulting in long-term commitments, without, perhaps, any worth. The public sector will pay more for the contracts overall; it will, of course, never own the land. The Minister said that there would be a risk transfer and that the private consortium would own the land that a hospital was built on. The trust would never own it, yet it would have paid for it. It would pay for the capital costs of the building, the lease arrangement and, in addition, money in interest. When the lease ran out, it would have no choice—or rather its choice would be either to abandon the project, still without owning the property, or, assuming that the service would, in many cases, still be needed, to renegotiate and pay yet more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
It was interesting to hear the Minister use his phrase about the private consortium owning the hospital already. We are witnessing exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for York spoke of—the move towards privatisation. The ownership of the hospital by the consortium is a step towards that. However, at least the services are to be provided, paid for and bought in by the national health service. The next step would come if the trust did not pay, having decided that it did not want the services, or if the lease ran out and the private company could get more money elsewhere—running the hospital as a private concern, as American companies do. At that point, it would become fully private. The NHS would have gone from that land and that hospital, which is what lies at the end of the road of those contracts when the leases run out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a short-term gain—private finance will be used for development—but the Government are using that to cap the NHS capital programme budget, which has been cut by 16.9 per cent., from £1.8 billion to £1.5 billion in 1996–97. Presumably, more cuts will follow. I hope that the difference will be made up by private capital and the PFI, but I am not sure that it will. That is the short-term gain; it is a tax cut which will be used in the not-so-distant future—certainly this year—by the Treasury. But what with the mistakes in contracts, the extra costs which trusts will have to pay when leases are renegotiated and the loss of control of the land, the real danger is that the public sector will be paying for years for that short-term gain. That is the big concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be relieved to hear that I shall not develop the general PFI debate; I want to deal with a couple of matters which arise from the amendment. I understand why, the Minister will resist amendment No. 5, which would oblige the Secretary of State to transfer "all" property, rights and liabilities as opposed to leaving the matter to discretion. It is clear in drafting terms why he will resist the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put to the Minister in a different form a question that I asked earlier. I am keen to explore current powers and possibilities of transfer. There are two levels at which transfer can take place. When a trust ceases to exist or is dissolved, the Secretary of State can either use his discretion or that discretion can be limited by the Bill, which deals with the issues that we are discussing: property, rights and liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister confirmed earlier that there are only two options: the Secretary of State will transfer liabilities either to one of the four listed agencies—he is one—or to the others at his discretion. The number of bodies to which he can transfer is limited by the list in the Bill and his power—either obligatory or discretionary—is to transfer only to a limited number of bodies. That relates to the 1990 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for York stressed, and as was made clear in the famous memorandum of the former
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
Member of Parliament for Lewisham, West, no matter what the Government say, people are concerned—they are even more worried because of the PFI—about the Government's fundamental commitment to the health service. I guess that that derives from the Conservatives' attitude in the 1940s when the Labour Government, supported by my party, approved the legislations to ring the NHS into existence. The Tory party opposed it, so the concern dates back to the beginning of the NHS, and the scepticism has remained ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern is about what a trust can do. Trusts work independently in theory but, as we know, are under direction in practice, in the sense that everyone is appointed by the Secretary of State or the non-executives. They could, therefore, stand up to the Secretary of State of the day only to have their contracts terminated, depending on the term. What can trusts do as regards transfer? I am questioning a trust's capacities to transfer is rights, liabilities and property to someone else. I discussed the PFI with the Minister earlier. I put it to him—and I am still of the view—that there is no benefit over the present system in PFI contract building. Much depends on how the contract has been drawn, but there is not necessarily any benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in terms of continuing obligations, there may be benefit in transferring management. But the downside to that—as the hon. Member for York said—is that we have no idea now of what the needs of the NHS will be in 10 years' time. A consortium led by AMEC, Wimpey or Barratt—or any of the new consortiums—may be commissioned to provide the building in which health services for Leeds, Stockport, Rotherham, or east or south London are to be offered, despite the fact that the needs of the building may be entirely different in 10 or 15 years' time. Philip Harris house is an excellent example. It was commissioned and built to be the state of the art building of the national health service. It was not intended to be an office block: it had special ducting, wiring and facilities to supply the cancer and kidney centres and the intensive care units. It was not just knocked up to be able to be transferred. If it is not to be used for the original purpose, additional public money will be spent to convert it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A consortium may be commissioned to provide services for 40 years, but who knows what the NHS will want at the end of that time? We cannot commission anything specific because in 10 or 15 years needs will have changed. We know the examples—fewer beds, more patients, different medicine and so on. My worry is that, under current legislative arrangements, it would be possible for a trust effectively to hand over some or all of its property rights and liabilities to a private consortium. I accept that that could not be done by the Secretary of State because he must transfer it to another NHS body. But what is to prevent a trust from handing over all its property, rights and liabilities, or 99 per cent. of them, to a private consortium?

What concerns many people is that the Health and Safety Commission will commission the trust to provide the services and—to use a phrase heard on the Floor of the House yesterday—the link between the trust and the services will be but a thread. There will merely be a conduit, whereby the trust exists simply to exist, while someone else provides the services. Once we begin to commission buildings, and the services in them, it is only a short step to there being nothing left for the trust to do. It can commission the purchasing, contracting, hiring and firing of staff, and everything can be handed out to the private sector, leaving the health trust as an agency—like an employment agency—that buys in and sells off. The question remains unanswered and it relates best to this group of amendments. I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may say a few words in the clause stand part debate about why the Bill is in its present form rather than drafted as an amendment to existing legislation. If the aim was to tidy up legislation, an amendment would have been far easier to refer to than a different Bill, separate from the original. I hope that the Minister has a jolly good response to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer this short debate in reverse order. I shall deal first with the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey. It is extraordinary that he keeps using the example of Guy's phase 3, which is proof of the inflexibility of our present arrangements. We have a purpose-built building that we have great difficulty in using in other ways, which are necessitated by changes in medical needs, as the hon. Member for York said. Those difficulties are a consequence of our present methods of operation. The PFI would build in more flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, South Buckinghamshire NHS trust, which is a PFI scheme, has made an arrangement whereby the lease payments are partially based on the volume of receipts by the trust. If the trust is not fully utilising its assets, the costs will be reduced. For example, one floor in the new building may be used in a way different from that which is presently envisaged. That is one way in which the private sector is imaginatively building in flexibility from the word go; flexibility of the type that Opposition Members say they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving forward because of the use of PFI and the skills of the private sector. We are overcoming some of the rigidity of which there has been far too many examples. I agree with Opposition Members that the history of NHS hospital building has been one of delay, with stages of building taking place years apart. Many buildings have had their uses changed and the construction price of many buildings was far higher than was originally envisaged. We want to get away from all those things that go wrong, and the PFi will give us a chance to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey's specific point about a transfer of assets by the trust. He envisaged a situation in which, ineluctably, land would be channelled out of the public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0809">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
sector without anyone being able to stop it. If the hon. Gentleman reads schedule 2 of the National Health Service and Community Care act 1990, he will see that paragraph 6(2) instructs trusts to follow directions made by the Secretary of State on a number of matters, including
	<br><blockquote><p>"the disposal of, or of any interest in, any asset</p></blockquote>
over a specified value. That would obviously include land. Even at the stage where a trust may decide that it does not want to transfer land to another trust, but wants it to be used or disposed of in some other way, the Secretary of State has specific rights to control what will happen to that land. His position is protected and land cannot flow into the private sector without anyone being able to stop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the problem, because the Secretary of State could say to the trust that the Government were relaxed and would not interfere, and if the trust wanted to contract out the land, building, services and staff, it could do so. What is to stop the Secretary of State having a guideline that allows the trust complete discretion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is enjoined, by his very existence, to act in the best interests of the NHS. That is what he is there for. Someone in a trust could not, without the knowledge or agreement of the Secretary of State, dispose of land. That has to be considered by the Secretary of State. The land will be valued. If there are old mental hospitals that are now surplus to requirements, it is sensible to transfer them to NHS estates. At that point, they become available to sell to the private sector for other uses. That is entirely rational. We do not wish to stop that process, which would be the effect of the amendment. That process is open—it cannot happen secretly or without the knowledge of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not for a moment suggesting that it would be done without the knowledge of the Secretary of State. My concern is not that trust X or Y would do something secretly, but that it might act in accordance with the views of the Secretary of State of the day. If the present Secretary of State for Defence were the Secretary of State for Health, he might regard it in the best interests of the health service that everything went into the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend would not be so irresponsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that, but he will not have that responsibility if the Tories lose the next election. God knows who will be in the next Tory Government, if there is one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a serious point, what is to prevent a trust, under the Secretary of State's guidelines, handing over everything to the private sector? What legislation would prevent that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1990 Act would prevent that. Trusts cannot hand over assets without going through the procedures laid down in the 1990 Act. That is absolutely clear. If the hon. Gentleman postulates a future example in which another Secretary of State—it certainly would not be the current one—agrees to the wholesale transfers of land, we are entering the realm of fantasy. It is not a realistic possibility. Health interests are protected by the 1990 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A general point was made about land and all other services being transferred, but I wish to ask specifically about land. Is the Minister saying that trusts will not be able to set their land aside in order to obtain PFI involvement? In some circumstances, they may almost be forced to give land away to get a private corporation involved. Is the Minister saying that trusts will not be able to do such deals under the 1990 Act, this Bill or other legislation without the Secretary of State's approval?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trusts will have the powers to do whatever deals they think are reasonable in the light of providing better health care. The Secretary of State has the right to control the transfer of assets, and he will use that right in the interests of better health care. That is his role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) made a number of points about PFI contracts and how we might develop guidance so that proper practice is followed. A business case suggested by a trust must be approved by the NHS Executive and it must go through the full procedures. In assessing a business case, the executive has developed guidance on how it should be developed and on what pitfalls may be before it. It takes a sensible approach that includes many items such as—the hon. Member for York mentioned this—what future demand may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a changing medical world contracts must contain flexibility. Future demand for a particular service must be assessed and possible trends considered. The NHS Executive is building in a model contract out of the inevitable trial and error that has been a feature of the early years of the process. I am confident that sensible practices are being followed. No doubt, there will be problems that we cannot foresee, but they will be overcome in a rational way and with the help from the central body that provides the appropriate guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leyton also asked what would happen if things go wrong. As I said about Guy's, if things go wrong with a PFI—they may well do so to some extent—taxpayers will suffer far less than they do now. If taxpayers provide a facility that is not fully used, they now have to bear the full burden for as long as the financing and the debt continue. Problems should bear less on taxpayers and the public sector than they do at present if we get better value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York asked about capital current spending and said that capital spending from Government sources would be reduced. In effect, he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0810">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
said that PFIs had been introduced to fill that gap. Let us get this into perspective: this year the Government are spending another £1.3 billion on current spending in the national health service—a huge increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Capital spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about current spending, which is in the order of £33 billion. Capital spending is in the order of £2 billion. There is a vast discrepancy between capital and current spending. Clearly, current spending is what determines the quality of the health service. Capital spending is important, but it is small compared with the amount spent on the salaries of the clinicians and support staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a huge increase in current spending. We said at the last general election that we would increase spending on the health service in real terms year by year. That commitment has been fully honoured this year, as it will be next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction in public support for capital spending is, by comparison, quite small. In addition, part of it is being met by increased land sales, as well as an increase in hospital building, which has been brought about by the PFI. However, we are talking about a reduction of only £100 million in one year, whereas current spending on the health service has risen by £1.3 billion. The increase of £1.3 billion from the public purse compared with a reduction of about £100 million in capital spending means that the relationship is 13 to one. The hon. Gentleman can hardly complain about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Either the Minister does not understand the difference between revenue and capital spending, or he has conveniently forgotten it for the purpose of making a party political broadcast on behalf of the Conservative party. I referred to capital spending because the PFI is intended to provide capital items for the NHS. It is intended, according to Government policy, to make good some—but not all—of the reduction in public sector Treasury money earmarked for capital spending on the NHS. Even if the PFI keeps pace with the Government's projections, there will be a net reduction in capital spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right—compared with revenue, capital spending is small. In fact, under-investment has been a problem in the health service over the years, under both Labour and Conservative Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's assertion that a lot of money is being spent in revenue terms on the NHS is wholly irrelevant to our discussion about the degree to which the PFI will substitute for the reduction in public sector capital provision. That is why I am talking about it—PFI is a substitute for public capital, not for public revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Current and capital spending are not unrelated because they both come out of the same pot—that which the taxpayer pays into the public sector. Giving a lot more to current spending and a tiny
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
amount less to the capital sum—which we believe can be made good from the private sector—is of great benefit to the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, whereas over the past 10 years only one hospital a year worth more than £25 million has been built, we have no fewer than 25 different hospitals each worth more than £25 million in the process of development. That is a quantum leap in hospital provision. It gives the hope of new hospitals to thousands of people throughout the country. The Opposition seem to want to force hospitals back into the queue for public money, rather than take advantage of the private money that is becoming available. That is a point on which I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Member for York.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his remarks on the need for flexibility, the hon. Gentleman mentioned Dawlish as an example of change. I wholly agree with him and believe that we shall see more flexibility as a consequence. The Dawlish contract is currently being renegotiated to take account of the wishes of the GP fundholding group for a different configuration of services, because the doctors have changed their views. They are renegotiating the contract with a private consortium. That will be the pattern for the future. That is an example of how flexibility can be built in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York also referred to clinical services. The Secretary of State has given a clear commitment; private capital can be used for support services, but clinical work will be done by those employed by the NHS. Clinical work is done privately only when the clinicians agree. There are very few examples of that—I can think of none. Such work is usually low-grade, such as that of a laboratory assistant, and there is always an NHS clinician in charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to the comment of Daniel Finkelstein, head of research at Conservative central office, that the NHS must be a guarantor of services uniquely suited to clinical need. We are guaranteeing that which the NHS can uniquely provide. Clinical services will continue to be provided by NHS clinicians but the private sector will do what it is good at—building buildings and supplying back-up facilities. That is a perfect example of the private-public combination working to the public good. The Labour party should support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could not think of any examples of the PFI being used for clinical or clinical-related services. Of the 44 PFI projects to date with a capital value of £1 million or more of which I am aware, nine appear to be for clinical or clinical-related services. Three are to provide beds for the elderly mentally ill in Teesside, Bedforshire, Brent and Harrow. Nursing home beds are to be provided in east Sussex. Provision will be made for an endoscopy unit at the West Middlesex hospital, a day surgery unit in Epsom, a private patient wing for the Royal Berkshire and Battle Hospitals trust and a patient hotel for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
Liverpool. There will be rebuilding projects for Wycombe general hospital and Amersham general hospital. There have been two further projects for the provision of pathologists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I trust that the list will come to an end shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has, Mr. O'Hara. I was merely pointing out that some PFI projects—by no means the majority—provide clinical or clinical-related services. That conflicts with the Secretary of State's statement last autumn that that was not the intention behind the PFI.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could go into those examples in detail, but I shall not. They could be taken apart if considered one by one, but I shall spare the hon. Gentleman that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Member for Rother Valley tabled the amendment and I have no quarrel with him on it. We have had a useful debate which, I hope, has clarified for all hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey, who is not here at the moment, our intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for York about the so-called perfect combination of the PFI being used to run clinical support services, rather than clinical services. The Minister may know that I wrote to the Secretary of State last month on an issue which I also raised in an oral question: what is a clinical service and what is a clinical support service? I wrote the letter five weeks ago. On Second Reading, I quoted his first reply to me, saying that the clinical and clinical support services were
	<br><blockquote><p>"both well-known terms of art within the health service. The scope of those terms is well defined."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 February 1996; Vol. 271, c. 794.]</p></blockquote>
I have not yet seen the scope of those services defined at all. The NHS executive documents show clinical and clinical support services in the same block. At some stage before the Bill is passed, the Minister should ask the Secretary of State to answer the letter that I wrote to him on 15 February and to explain that art within the health service. The Minister should define for the Committee what clinical and clinical support services are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to consider this matter in great detail because people are suspicious that PFI definitions fit whatever can be got away with on the ground. If so, this is privatisation by stealth—a process that tells clinicians who desperately want new equipment and new buildings so that they can help more people that if they do not go down that route, they will not get what they want. On many occasions, we have seen resources held back in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton said that our debate on the operation of the PFI would be better
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
informed if we knew exactly, but not in terms of commercial detail, the terms of the contracts for major PFI projects. We must know exactly what is meant by design, build, finance and operate in respect of hospitals. If we knew the details of the contracts, we would be better equipped to address the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that my hon. Friend was fundamentally muddled as to the issue of contracts and liabilities. However, that is not the issue. The question being asked by Opposition Members is what happens when a body has a contract, through the PFI, to provide and operate services in a hospital, but the requirements then change. What happens when the local trust or the NHS decides that provision has to change because that type of service is no longer needed? When changes are made or mergers take place, muddled thinking is revealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the PFI brings new flexibility to contracts. No one denies that delays have afflicted the public sector. For decades, the yearly alteration in Treasury capital expenditure funds has affected the building of hospitals in Britain. However, I have to ask why a system has been introduced for the PFI that has delays built in. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) mentioned that his local hospital was close to being signed up, but then a deadline came in that meant it had to go through the PFI, and a two-year delay resulted. If the PFI is to be introduced, there must be a clear definition of what areas it can operate in, and it should not be introduced in a way that increases delays. That is a fundamental wrong for which the Government are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the system of PFI is a matter of trial and error, which might be so. I am lucky that the previous Labour Government set in train the rebuilding of Rotherham's hospital services, and we are not in need of a hospital in or near my constituency. For those hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who are not so lucky, the idea that this new system is one of trial and error will not be satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to break clauses. With a long PFI contract lasting perhaps 20 years, it may be decided that the service is not needed after 10 years. Medical science and medical practice move on because medicine is evidence-based and we are becoming more knowledgeable about medical science. It would be better if there were break clauses in the contracts so that contracts of 20 or 25 years for public sector service were not signed when it might be necessary to make changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the holder of a PFI contract could not agree changes, even if a break clause was included, what would happen if a trust could not renegotiate the contract? I suggested during a sedentary intervention earlier that in those circumstances another building would have to be constructed and the Minister, while seated, said "Yes." Most people would not understand that. If a PFI contract, with or without a break clause, had ended, been paid off and liability had been accepted by the Secretary of State but the relationship had been soured, the only option for the public sector
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0812">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
might be to put up another building. Most people would think that that is ludicrous, but that is what would have to happen and a public building might remain empty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are probing amendments, but questions on the PFI and how it will affect the public sector remain
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
unanswered. Given the good will that we want, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
