<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 25, line 7, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>"or if it is incapable of producing methane or other greenhouse gases.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 54, in page 25, line 7, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Inert material is material that does not physically or chemically react, decay or adversely affect other matter with which it comes into contact in a way likely to give rise to environmental pollution.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Hogg. The clause deals with the amount of tax that landfill operators are required to collect: a rate of either £7 per tonne or £2 per tonne. The change from an ad valorem duty to a charge on tonnage was a welcome response to points made during the consultation process. The distinction between the rates is given in subsection (4) which states that the lower rate will apply to
<br><blockquote><p>"material … of a kind commonly described as inactive or inert."</p></blockquote>
There have been several representations that the words "inactive or" do not add to the definition and that they should be left out.<br><br>
The point that I wish to make on the amendment is one that I made on the Floor of the House when clause 36 was discussed; it was raised by British Alcan Aluminium, a company based in Gerrards Cross, in my constituency, which has an important production plant in Scotland. I am concerned this morning with the impact of the landfill tax on the Scottish plant because it is the sole United Kingdom producer of alumina chemicals. It produces 350 different specialised alumina products that are supplied to around 600 customers in 50 countries. British Alcan is a major United Kingdom plc and takes its environmental responsibilities seriously; it has invested significant capital in improving the environmental aspects of its production process.<br><br>
The process at the plant in Scotland produces a waste product known as red mud, which is landfilled at an in-house site that is owned and operated by British Alcan. Red mud is an alkaline waste remaining after the extraction of alumina from bauxite, a naturally occurring ore. The company has already
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
spent large sums on research and development but the recycling of waste has proved not to be an option, so it must be disposed of by landfill. Every effort is made by the company to minimise waste but every year approximately 115,000 tonnes of red mud are landfilled in a totally enclosed site that was formerly an abandoned shale mine. That is agreed to be the best practical environmental option. All effluent is returned to the plant where the maximum possible alkali is returned to the extractive process. No effluent arising from the site enters the surrounding environment and no methane or other greenhouse gases can be produced, That is the point of my amendment: the main environmental disadvantage of landfill is methane gas production but no gas is produced in British Alcan's process.<br><br>
The example of British Alcan reveals one of the difficulties with the landfill tax, which I fully support, however, because I believe that it will, over time, lead to a desirable change in environmental behaviour. British Alcan produces a commodity product for a world market: I have already mentioned the number of products it manufactures and the number of customers and countries to which it sells. The market price of its products is a world market price. The effect of imposing an extra tax of £2 or £7 a tonne—certainly £7 a tonne—will be to render those products totally uncompetitive in the world market. As a consequence, there will be a genuine danger that British Alcan will no longer be able to produce at that plant and will have to make its products at an overseas plant. Up to 600 jobs will be put at risk.<br><br>
I accept that the Government want to keep the tax as simple and straightforward as possible. As with any tax, the dilemma is that there may be some rough justice. If we try to achieve greater fairness, the measure immediately becomes more complex. The distinction between £7 a tonne and £2 a tonne will be dealt with in regulations. I hope that there will be full consultation on those regulations so that we can ensure that the important dividing line between £7 and £2 a tonne is seen to be fair to British industry and allows it to remain competitive while ensuring that the landfill tax secures its objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was rather puzzled by the speech of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I would have said the opposite to what he said on the amendment. I would like to make my point and give him the opportunity to respond.<br><br>
On a later amendment we shall have a full discussion about the differential between £2 a tonne and £7 a tonne and the difference between "inert" and "inactive". I have failed to find anyone who can tell me the difference between "inert" and "inactive": perhaps it reflects the Government's preference for using two words when one would do. I am sure we will get an answer to that before the end of the debate.<br><br>
Amendment No. 29 would add at the end of line 7,
<br><blockquote><p>"or if it is incapable of producing methane or other greenhouse gases."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0312">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
The hon. Gentleman explained that those gases significantly damage the environment. Clearly, the release, as and when, of methane or greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is damaging and will not help us meet our target for carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the century. However, many bodies believe that the overriding issue for environmental policy is for major landfill sites to have the technical resources so that methane thus released can be turned into useful power generation. I am sure we will return to this issue, because it is a way of recycling the revenue from this tax for a useful purpose.<br><br>
Environmental organisations want the Government to achieve a target of generating 10 per cent. of United Kingdom electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. One element in meeting that target would be to use more methane from landfill sites. A table that was produced by the Socialist Environment and Resources Association, SERA, shows that contracted capacity—the number of projects that have the capacity to produce methane—is 84. There are, however, only 53 contracted projects and only 46—about half of the projects to produce methane for useful purposes—are live.<br><br>
One of the aims of the landfill tax should be to direct more resources, research and expertise towards extracting methane—a renewable power source—from our big landfill sites. Much technology is being dedicated to that end, but the same is not true of finance. It is currently difficult to derive commercial benefits from such projects, although I am certain that that will not be so in the future.<br><br>
Will the hon. Member for Beaconsfield enlighten me about amendment No. 29? I got the impression from his remarks that it could be a disincentive to using methane beneficially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was not intended as such. A 2 MW power station at Wapseys Wood landfill site at Gerrards Cross in my constituency already uses methane from landfills to produce electricity. The amendment seeks to make it clear that material should be taxed at £7 a tonne if it produces methane and at £2 a tonne if it does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to intervene, but the hon. Gentleman sat down too quickly. Amendment No. 29 is perhaps reductionist because it focuses on methane only. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that contaminated leachate may pose a separate problem and that the amendment excludes reference to that? It reclassifies the term "insert"—as long as waste does not produce methane, it can be taxed at the lower rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that my amendment is not perfect. I do not suggest that methane is the only environmentally damaging consequence of landfill, although it is the most significant. Landfill can, of course, result in leakage if the hole is not properly sealed. The amendment seeks, however, to draw attention to British Alcan's specific problem, and does
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
not go wider. It is a peg on which to hang that company's concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield for his support for the concept of the tax and the charging structure, and I understand the intention behind the amendments. By focusing on methane emissions, however, the amendments overlook sources of potential pollution that would put waste in the standard category. I refer particularly to the possibility of groundwater pollution. Certain categories of waste not only are potential producers of greenhouse gas, but must be excluded from the inert or inactive category because of other pollution characteristics. So I cannot accept amendment No. 29.<br><br>
Amendment No. 54 goes too far in the other direction by offering an even stricter definition of inactive waste that would exclude material that might react chemically. It is an extremely tough definition. Some materials such as plastics do not decompose, do not produce groundwater pollution or methane but are nevertheless potentially reactive: they can catch fire if enough energy is put into them.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I am not attracted therefore to amendment No. 54. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield clearly had a specific industrial case in mind—the production of a form of red mud by British Alcan. He made a case for defining such waste in the inactive category. I can assure my hon. Friend that the consultation exercise on what should be defined as inert or inactive has only just finished, and we shall bring the definitions forward by means of a Treasury order. I am certainly aware of the debate over definitions, not only from what I have heard this morning but from industries that are worried about their form of waste incurring the £7 a tonne charge. We shall return to the issue later in our proceedings as I understand that my hon. Friend has tabled further appropriate amendments which we can debate then. I can assure him that, in asking him not to press the amendments, I am not closing the door entirely on the case that he has put forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful for some clarification from the Minister. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield has presented valuable amendments, which I hope that he will press to a Division. Many of my constituents work in the steel industry for an important firm called Yorkshire Environmental Ltd., which deals with quarry and waste management work. I am worried that people will not understand what subsection (4) means. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury must have regard to the object of securing that material is listed if it is of a kind commonly described as inactive or inert."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) has already posed the valid question as to why we need two adjectives—inactive and inert—in the subsection. I am suspicious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0313">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
of provisions that include the adverb "commonly"; and I cannot work out where the verb is. The only controlling verb appears to be "must", unless there is a new verb "must have regard". I may be thick—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perish the thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand it but I am prepared to listen to interventions from those on the Treasury Front Bench if they can put the subsection into English for me. As I read it, a substantial new power is being given to the Treasury to intervene in managing this country's environmental policy.<br><br>
I sincerely congratulate the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on tabling the amendments, and others that highlight the worrying terms of the drafting of the clauses on landfill tax. The amendments expose the failure adequately to define the role of taxation and the Budget in our environmental policy and the failure to consult more widely rather than behind the closed doors of the Treasury.<br><br>
We ought to work in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry to list and define far more clearly the clause's meaning. If we do not do that, the Committee's whipped majority will push clause 38 through and I fear that the Treasury will be given a blank cheque to define for its own revenue-raising purposes what will be taxed and at what rate, and to decide what is inactive and what is inert. I may consider those currently on the Treasury Front Bench to be "inert" but I would not "commonly" describe them in that way. Will the Minister explain what the clause means in English so that my constituents, the managers of Yorkshire Environmental Ltd. and the managers of the steel plants in my constituency will understand?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (4) has been included precisely so that the Committee and, more generally, the House can direct the way in which subsequent Treasury orders will be drawn up. Its purpose is to guide secondary legislation. The phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"commonly described as inactive or inert"</p></blockquote>
uses reasonably familiar terms. Most people would understand the general type of waste to which we refer. However, the precise definitions are inevitably complex and somewhat technical, and are better delegated to secondary legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The concept of inert waste is readily understood by everybody in the environmental industry. As the Minister will be aware, the Environmental Services Association, which has a long record of reliability in environmental industries, said that it did not know why clause 38 includes the word "inactive". Why does it refer to "inactive or inert"? There must be a distinction between inert, which people understand, and inactive, but there is genuine puzzlement and concern about what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They should not be concerned, because having both words widens the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
definition and makes it more likely, if anything, that more waste will be classified in the £2 per tonne rather than in the £7 per tonne category. I do not understand the concerns expressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that matters would be clarified by regulation. Does not the Minister see that that lies at the heart of the matter? If we who merely give guidance to the drafters of secondary legislation cannot distinguish between inert and inactive, that is no way to legislate. We have had representations from the Institute of Taxation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and many others to say that it is unacceptable for so many important matters to be left to secondary legislation. I invite the Minister to have another stab at defining inert and inactive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not know how long the hon. Gentleman has sat on Committees such as this one but surely he is familiar with the concept that all Governments of all parties have accepted since legislation got under way—that detailed matters of definition are delegated to secondary legislation. That not only prevents primary legislation from being gummed up with a lot of technical terms that are better dealt with through secondary legislation, but introduces flexibility to our procedures—definitions can change to respond to technical advances. Alterations to classifications are often required and, rather than wait for opportunities for primary legislation, they are often made by Treasury order, which means that the House still has the opportunity to scrutinise and, if necessary, to reject the legislation. It would be absurd were matters of distinction between one type of chemical and another to be put into primary legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a result of representations made to me by a constituent involved in mineral extraction, I want to know why inert or inactive materials are being included in the scope of the tax at all. Although I understand the need to tax what was previously defined as controlled waste, why are we taxing the disposal of entirely safe and innocuous materials? In the case of mineral extraction, the problem is simply one of getting rid of large volumes of material as quickly and as environmentally sensitively as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Controlled waste can include inactive waste too. The tax is designed not only to tax waste with the potential to pollute water or air, but to catch the external costs associated with the landfilling of rubble waste and all categories of inactive waste. Such activities are not without environmental impact.<br><br>
I am sure that some letters from my hon. Friends' constituents, who live near landfill sites, reflect the problems caused by noise, dust, smell, seagulls and lorry movements. Those represent an external cost of landfilling even inactive or inert waste. The tax is designed to capture those costs and to attribute them to the producer of the waste. The proposed lower rate of tax at £2 per tonne reflects the lower impact on the environment caused by that category of waste.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0314">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
The Committee should not take fright at the word "inactive". It is obtained from a Department of the Environment classification system so is familiar to those who handle, transport and dispose of waste in all forms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely seek clarification. I have the Department of the Environment White Paper, "Making Waste Work". Can the minister refer me to a definition of "inactive" in that recent statement of Government policy on the disposal of waste?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred earlier to the fact that we have consulted ourselves on the definitions—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: But no one else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just give me a page number.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being unreasonable. If he shows me the book, I will endeavour to read it and to point out the sections to which he refers. This is a Finance committee and we are introducing a category of inert waste. I have already assured the Committee that the secondary legislation to give effect to the exact definitions of inert and inactive waste will be brought before the House in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much encouraged by my hon. Friend's comments. There is a difficult balance to achieve. Of course, we could try to legislate for every category of waste to be included in the Bill. In many ways, that would be desirable. My second amendment, to which I did not refer, would have placed a bit of a straitjacket on my hon. Friend, as he said, when he came to examine the regulations. Subsection (4) must be examined carefully. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury must have regard to the object of securing that material is listed".</p></blockquote>
That implies quite a bit of latitude. My hon. Friend the Minister has said that he will consider carefully all the points that are made in response to the consultation.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
A number of issues and conflicting priorities must be balanced. The Bill must achieve its environmental objectives, but we must also consider its effect on industrial competitiveness. I know that my hon. Friend will consider carefully what I said about British Alcan and the other companies whose representations we shall deal with later.<br><br>
It would be wrong to pursue an amendment that is less than perfect. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 25, line 7, at end add—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Where the material disposed of consists entirely of special material this section applies as if the reference to £7 were to £15.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) Special material is material for the time being listed for the purposes of this section in an order.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is designed to introduce a new higher rate for toxic waste, which for definitional purposes the amendment refers to as "special material". Earlier, the Paymaster General spoke about the importance of regulations that interpret and give guidance to each of the categories. He also mentioned the consultation undertaken by Customs and Excise, and I shall refer to the report published by it on the responses received to the original consultation paper on landfill tax.<br><br>
The consultation made it clear, as the Government subsequently acknowledged, that there should be a move from an ad valorem tax to a banded tax. The submissions warned, however, of the environmental damage caused by different types of waste. We believe it makes sense to have at least three tax bands for charging purposes to ensure that waste is charged according to the potential damage that it could do the environment. That approach is different from that contained in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.<br><br>
Various suggestions have been made about how to implement the proposal for more bands, and a number of organisations advocate a wider range of tax levels to accommodate acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, ecotoxicity, explosion risk, biological hazard, nutrient and biological oxygen demand and the atmospheric effects of greenhouse gases, ozone destroyers, particulates and so on. In addition, it was suggested that the tax should reflect commitments to control or eliminate specific substances and that it should contribute towards the achievement of national targets.<br><br>
The amendment is much more modest. We endorse the approach of using a banded tax, on which Cambridge Econometrics has also commented. In its report "A Prospective Assessment of the Landfill Tax", that body stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"A banded tax with different rates according to the nature of the material being disposed of would ensure that the most inert materials would attract the lowest tax, while hazardous materials would attract the highest tax rates. The principle of banding according to quantities and types of waste has already been established in relation to the Charging Scheme for waste management licences."</p></blockquote>
In the report on the consultation about landfill, the Government confirmed that most of the responses supported a weight-based tax and favoured a banded approach, on the grounds that the tax should be paid and should relate to environmental damage caused by different types of waste.<br><br>
The amendment would add £15 to the proposals for £2 and £7. That would begin to recognise environmental damage while balancing the clear difficulties of regulatory definition of the different bands. Moreover, the proposal would give industry in particular the opportunity to plan, on the basis of the Bill's declared intentions, for the eventual inposition of a landfill tax to fulfil those objectives.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the amendment, which would insert a third category of tax for waste defined as "special". We have discussed already, in our earlier debate about "inactive" and "inert", the complexity of the definitions of different types of waste. I am aware also that the definition of "special", if a third band of tax is to be introduced, will be of great concern to all the industrial groups involved.<br><br>
I noted, and in a way understood, the knee-jerk reaction from the Confederation of British Industry, which made it clear that it did not want a third tax band set at £15 a tonne for special material. The CBI said that it assumed that the amendment's use of the phrase "special material" referred to special wastes—that is, hazardous wastes—which are currently controlled by the special waste regulation. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) will want to clarify that point.<br><br>
Other hon. Members may have landfill sites in their constituencies that have been designated as appropriate for hazardous waste, but I know that one such site exists at Bayton in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts). All hon. Members will be aware of the anxiety of people in areas where a landfill site has been so designated.<br><br>
Many interventions by my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe in Adjournment debates and questions received what could be interpreted as the slightly complacent response that most hazardous waste is lightweight waste, often from hospitals, that may have a radioactive element. We should put a special premium on special—hazardous—waste, if for no other reason than that we need to encourage research into the technology of production processes that create such waste or the waste streams that take special waste from hospitals, so that they no longer produce waste that is, or can be interpreted as, hazardous waste for landfill sites.<br><br>
The public disquiet over such events as the Brent Spar disposal—I hope that you will not think I am straying from the debate, Mr. Hogg—shows how worried people become if they believe that any hazardous substance, particularly radioactive waste, has been put in landfill sites near their community. I do not think that that is a NIMBY—not in my backyard—attitude; it expresses a wider public worry that needs to be conveyed to the nuclear industry generally and to any industry that creates or produces elements of radioactivity. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) will remember that when the Select Committee on the Environment went to eastern Europe to examine the severe pollution problems of the former Soviet Union and the Ukraine, we visited Chernobyl. After that visit, we stressed, in all our discussions with the representatives of the UK Government and of industrial concerns in the UK and those countries, the need to put extra resources and technology into developing methods of dismemberment, disposal and disintegration of such plants—plants that are often worthwhile in terms of their generation of power.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to bring my hon. Friend back to her remarks about hospital waste, which in one of the most sensitive areas of waste disposal, particularly because it contains low level radioactive leftovers from X-ray procedures and highly toxic drugs. However, should we be considering imposing new costs on our national health service, which is hardly generously financed at the moment? Should not part of the problem be dealt with through regulation and by assisting modern disposal methods, particularly closed-circuit incineration? I hope that the Committee will not convey the message to NHS trust managers that we are about to lumber them with huge new costs as they grapple with the problem of waste disposal. That brings me back to the earlier point that although taxation is one method of guiding people's behaviour, we must also accept responsibility for regulation and make clear orders so that modern methods can be brought into play.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hillsborough will forgive me for interrupting. I had quite forgotten that that was an intervention. I hope that other interventions will be shorter.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) for his contribution, shall we call it, rather than intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend dealt with the core of this section of the Bill. Conservative Members should understand that this new, important tax is, in principle, supported by hon. Members on both sides. Because it is a new tax we must send the right signals in every element of the clauses.<br><br>
I take on board—as I am sure does my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South—the point that the amendment may be seen as bumping up charges for the NHS, which is not our intention. The landfill tax will be satisfactory only if it fulfils environmental policy goals and not just Treasury policy goals. I am sure we shall discuss that possible contradiction later.<br><br>
I was referring to Chernobyl and the Select Committee's conclusions from its visit to eastern Europe. We found that the biggest gap in know-how and technology in the nuclear industry was in disposal: the dismantling of old or disused plants and material and their disposal. Nowhere were we given a satisfactory answer to the question of how nuclear plants can be disposed of safely—that will apply to this country in due course without a doubt. The first place the nuclear industry will look when wanting to dispose of old and past-it nuclear plant is to the land. Our country is short of land where such material can be disposed of correctly.<br><br>
For those general reasons, it is important to consider urgently the problem of hazardous special
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0316">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
waste. If a third band of landfill tax will introduce that urgency into the debate, I fully support my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South.<br><br>
On a more parochial note, the Stocksbridge Engineering Steels plant in my constituency is nervous because it has invested a great deal in a dust extraction process to make the employees' working conditions safer. The dust that is gathered contains much of the gunge from electric arc steel making. There is an urgent need for clarification of how the solid particles within the dust will be categorised. Some of that material will end up as landfill waste, so we must establish whether it can be categorised as special or whether it will be liable for the £7 charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the amendment. It is one of several attempts that we shall launch today to make the tax more environmentally sound. We support the principle of the tax, but it is a blunt instrument for achieving environmental purposes and some people suspect that it is basically a money-raising measure.<br><br>
I accept that framing definitions is difficult, but it remains important to have more than two bands for this tax. Definitions can be advanced through regulation. We need a higher level of tax for the sort of waste mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough. In a minute, I shall provide another example of where a higher level is justified.<br><br>
Perthaps inadvertently, we are supporting the CBI response to the consultation paper. It argued for three bands and for a higher rate to be levied on special waste. It also made a case for certain categories of waste to be exempt. I shall say more about that later when we debate contaminated land.<br><br>
My specific example may not appear to be highly toxic in itself, but its production leads to much pollution. I am talking about incineration ash. One of my main fears about the tax is that it will lead to an increase not in recycling but in incineration as an alternative to landfill.<br><br>
The 1993 report for the Department of the Environment, produced by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, concluded that a levy of £5 per tonne would do nothing to promote recycling but would direct an extra 5 per cent. of domestic waste to incineration. It was also argued that £10 per tonne would still hardly benefit recycling but that another 8 per cent. of waste would be diverted to incineration. We must deal with that aspect of the problem. To discourage that effect, we should opt for a higher rate for incineration, otherwise landfill in the ground will be replaced by landfill in the sky, which is totally unacceptable. The Danes tax landfill and incineration at the same level.<br><br>
We need greater distinction between the different sorts of waste going into landfill sites. I acknowledge that that may be more difficult to administer but we should regulate the bands to take it into account. We could then raise the same amount of money but in a more environmentally sound way. We need to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
consider how landfill site operators work and penalise those with low efficiency methane collections. That may go beyond the amendment but it is part of the same scene of making the tax more environmentally sound.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the amendment. We are back to definitions. The move from two bands to three makes a definition of the elements that enter the waste stream more important. The Minister earlier queried how long I had served on the Committee. I know, however, that the Chairman of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments complained a few days ago in the Procedure Committee about the recent explosion in secondary legislation—the number of statutory instruments has increased from 2,300 in 1987 to 3,300 now. Some matters, including definitions, should be dealt with in the Bill.<br><br>
I support the third band because it would persuade people to dispose of toxic waste by means other than landfilling. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) said that incineration was one option, but it is not always the first because of its expense—it can cost up to £100 a tonne.<br><br>
I was just reading the document "Making waste work", of which the Minister should be aware. Page 24 shows a diagram of central London. The United Kingdom produces enough solid toxic waste every year to engulf the Palace of Westminster—right to the top of Big Ben. We produce more than 300 million cubic metres of solid toxic waste every year—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Including our speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, including copies of <i>Hansard.</i> Much of that waste will go into landfill. The landfill tax is intended to persuade people who generate waste to dispose of it by other means. It is surely common sense, therefore, that a third band—at £15 a tonne—would discourage them from landfilling waste that could be disposed of in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The landfill tax first saw the light of day when the Chancellor was in his green mood—artists have various colour moods, and so does the Chancellor. He packaged the landfill tax as an environmental proposal, just as he did with VAT on fuel. His real intentions, however, have nothing to do with environmental protection; they are about leaching more money from the population.<br><br>
The amendment would allow the tax to focus better on improving waste management—an issue that the Select Committee on the Environment raised. The Chancellor's objective was to get his hands on more revenue, but the amendment would enhance the environment.<br><br>
The Government have espoused the "polluter pays" principle for some time. We have seen before—and shall see again if we do not accept the amendment—that that principle exists in name only and does nothing for practice on the ground. We have "polluter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
pays" legislation for contaminated land, but the Government have taken no effective action on that issue. In this case, however, the tax might raise more revenue for the Exchequer, so there is no reason for the Government to oppose it at all. We would focus people's attention on exactly what they are doing—what they are dumping, where they are dumping it and the consequences of their activities.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
We should consider moving forward on that matter and refining the tax as time goes on in order to make absolutely sure that it achieves its environmental objects, not just its tax-take objects, which are so prominent in the minds of Treasury Ministers. I went on the trip to Chernobyl with my hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough. I seem to get involved in all the best parliamentary visits—a junket to Chernobyl.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend came back glowing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, constituents shied away from me and crossed the street for the next few months while the matter was still in their minds.<br><br>
Events in other countries show us the consequences of not protecting the environment over a long period of time. I do not believe that the Chancellor's green mood was anything other than a sham, a cloak to cover tax-raising opportunities, but let us try to turn it into a measure that focuses on the environment and affects people's activities and methods of operation in a positive manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is designed to introduce a third band for so-called special material and to tax it at 15 per tonne. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), who gave us his credentials for criticising secondary legislation, has not spotted that the amendment not only delegates the description of such waste to secondary legislation, but fails to give any direction at all about what should constitute special waste. It would benefit the whole Committee if the Opposition could quietly decide among themselves what their objections are and make their amendments consistent with their own criticisms. Unlike the clause, which outlines what inert and inactive waste are to be, there is nothing to guide the makers of secondary legislation about what special waste should be.<br><br>
There are many unanswered questions. The hon. Member for Hillsborough is right to ask her Front-Bench colleague whether the dust which is caught in part of the steel-making process would fall within the special category and attract a charge of 15 per tonne. There are important industrial cost implications in the answer to that, but we did not hear an answer from the mover of the amendment. That is one of the reasons why I recommend that we oppose it.<br><br>
A further point concerns the overall simplification argument. Wherever possible, we must try to make the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
tax simple and easy to understand. To adopt multiple rates would be an unwelcome complication, making the tax more difficult to enforce—there would be more borderlines to police and it would be more difficult for firms to comply. There is a presumption in favour of simplicity, which is why we have gone for two rates and not more.<br><br>
As to the specific proposal that some waste should be taxed at a higher rate—the intention is presumably for that to apply to hazardous waste—there are already tight controls on the handling, transport and disposal of such waste. Therefore, the producers of hazardous waste already incur higher costs and the external costs which we are attempting to capture—which I explained to my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin)—are already applied in the landfill charges, at least to an approximate extent. It is significant that Denmark exempts entirely certain hazardous wastes because it believes that the higher cost that already applies to them is a substitute for a landfill tax. I cannot therefore accept that that is either wise or desirable.<br><br>
Incineration, which the hon. Member for Leith talked about, is not necessarily bad. It can be environmentally advantageous to capture energy from a waste stream through incineration, provided the plant is constructed properly and pollutants are caught before they enter the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that all but one of the 26 waste incinerators in this country do not comply with EU health standards and that high levels of dioxins and other pollutants will therefore be released? Is the Minister not worried that the landfill tax may well increase incineration?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As with every other industrial plant, incinerators are subject to environmental law. It is up to Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution, which will shortly become the environmental agency, to enforce those regulations.<br><br>
I have visited incineration plants that combine heat and power systems and which do a good job of capturing the energy from waste. Reducing the quantity of waste and its weight minimises the eventual landfill operation. I do not accept that incineration is necessarily a bad way of handling waste.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hunt <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wirral, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall, as I do, from our experience in the Department of Energy that incineration plants are performing very satisfactorily throughout the world without the environmental consequences that the hon. Member for Leith mentioned. Indeed, in the heart of Stockholm there is a huge incineration plant that is fed by domestic waste. It is perfectly possible to attain the environmental conditions that my hon. Friend the Minister described. I strongly support what he said, and would add that incineration minimises the inconvenience to local residents of a landfill site adjoining their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those are sound words. My right hon. Friend is obviously familiar with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
incineration plant in Stockholm. I visited one in Munich when I was in the Department of the Environment. It is true that not only is incineration a good way of handling waste and preventing it all from having to be landfilled, but it is a form of alternative energy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can anticipate the hon. Lady. She said that at least 10 per cent. of British energy requirements should be met from alternative energy schemes. Incineration is precisely one of those schemes. To capture that energy, particularly in a combined heat and power plant, contributes towards that target while at the same time dealing with the waste.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is correct to say that there is no disagreement over a nonpolluting process of incineration that leads to recyclable energy combined with heat and power. However, does the Minister agree that the failure of the Energy Saving Trust, which was set up to boost investment into compound heat and power schemes, has delayed the progress of such schemes in this country disastrously? Is he saying that this tax will be significantly recycled to promote combined heat and power in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to trawl back over my micro career but when I was in the Department of Energy I had close dealings with the Combined Heat and Power Association. It did very good work in promoting combined heat and power schemes, not only to deal with large quantities of waste but with waste on an industrial plant scale. So I do not accept that the dice are loaded against that form of energy production, but the tax will give a modest encouragement to energy recovery simply because we are taxing the alternative: landfill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the residue of incineration must be landfilled? If he accepted the broad principle, if not the specific amendment, that we should have not a blunt but a precise instrument, he could vary the level of tax on the residue from incineration and that might enable us to intervene at the appropriate level to encourage the various methods of waste disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have explained that the new tax will help incineration, but residues from an incineration plant, if they must be landfilled, will properly bear tax. If the residues are wholly inert, they will incur the rate of £2 per tonne or if, more probably, they include pollutants or active material, of £7 per tonne. The hon. Gentleman seems to want to make the legislation more complicated to achieve more precise aims, which is a balance that the Committee must strike—but the Opposition also complain about the length of the Finance Bill and the complexity of financial legislation. We want to pursue environmental and tax aims in a way that does not unnecessarily complicate the tax.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General made a plea for consistency in approach which, given the proposals on landfill tax as a whole, is a cheek. If the argument about keeping the legislation simple means that the tax is ineffective or barely has any impact, it is a spurious one. To say that the proposal is modest is an understatement.<br><br>
The Minister is aware that in the consultation responses there are many pleas for preferential tax treatment, which seem to increase weekly as industry beings to discover what "the polluter pays" means. The submission summarised by the Minister's Department said that the special pleading broke down into four broad categories. First, that the waste is inert and its producers should be penalised less or not at all. Our amendments on schedule 4 deal with that; in tabling all our amendments on landfill tax we realised that we could not perfect the legislation or even achieve our objectives but we wanted to help ease in the new tax. The second category of special pleading was that the tax is not consistent with the concept of "the polluter pays"; we shall return to that point. Thirdly, that the proposal could produce effects contrary to the aim of landfill—and I presume that that aim is still the same as it was when we debated the matter on the Floor of the House, when the Minister made it clear that the purpose of the tax was to move away from landfill and to encourage alternative methods of disposal. The aim was to seek out more environmentally acceptable ways of dealing with disposal, and we hope that the tax will encourage people to think about recycling and to consider whether they can engage in strategies that would prevent the production of waste.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The final set of special pleadings was based on the effect on commercial competitiveness. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield gave one example of that, and some of my hon. Friends gave others. The proposal is very straightforward. The tax should encourage people to seek out better forms of waste management and to think about the waste that they produce. We need to give a clear indication in legislation of the direction in which we are heading. The present proposals on landfill tax do not do that.<br><br>
We must also be clear about how the tax will work. The Minister was right to say that the Bill would be even longer than it is if it covered all the ground to be covered by statutory instruments. However, it would at least give us a total picture. The Government may want to think about the way they prepare legislation, but in the absence of clear guidance on definitions—and given that he is unable to tell us the differences between the categories that he prefers—it is breathtaking that the Minister should criticise the Opposition for engaging in a legislative process established by the Government. If the Minister is saying that we should take away the amendment and completely rewrite the Bill from clause 35 to clause 63, he should consider giving more time for debate on the Bill as a whole.<br><br>
The use of three bands would indicate how the different levels of waste should be taxed. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
wants to reject the proposal, first because the Government did not think of it and, secondly, because the reality of landfill is not to encourage environmentally friendly behaviour. We know that from the disputes between the Treasury and the Department of the Environment, which initiated the debates and consultations on this tax.<br><br>
We intend to press the amendment to a Division. It represents an approach to refining some aspects of the tax. It will not render the tax perfect, but we must make some progress. We must try out the taxes and learn from the process. That way we can move on to the next set of proposals in the future.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave clause 38 and the question of classification, I would be grateful if the Paymaster General could explain a little more about how the waste classification scheme will operate and how it will be developed. Undoubtedly, it will form the crux of many discussions, arguments and appeals while the various industries get themselves geared up to complying with the new tax, which we all want them to address and understand so that they can comply with it as smoothly as possible.<br><br>
I shall use as an example the industry that I know about. It has expressed concern that the processes put in place to draw up the waste classification scheme will not provide the necessary detail in time for the implementation of the tax on 1 October 1996. I emphasise to the Paymaster General the seriousness of the situation for major industries such as the steel industry, which at present works on the basis that its best estimate is that the landfill tax could be an on-cost of 35p a tonne. If some of the decisions about waste classification are not determined as the industry currently assumes, the cost could be much greater.<br><br>
Can the Paymaster General confirm that the consultation draft on the development of the national waste classification scheme was sent out in December,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
that the final date for responses was 31 January and that it is hoped that a further draft will be produced within one or two months? In that context, I want to read out the response to the consultation from the British Iron and Steel Producers Association, which is clearly supportive
<br><blockquote><p>"of the aim of producing a classification scheme that can be used by everyone in the waste chain".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that we would totally support that as an especially useful exercise. However, the response continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The real test of the scheme will be whether it supplies the necessary information to enable interested parties to make the decisions required of them. For example adequate protection of the environment, safe handling of waste and achievement of legal obligations."</p></blockquote>
As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has said, all industries with an interest in the landfill tax will have to decide how they should respond to the imposition of the tax.<br><br>
BISBA argues that the scheme is not yet robust enough to distinguish between waste in category 1, the £2 rate, and waste in category 2, the £7 rate. Forget whether we use the term "inert" or "inactive", the definition of waste in category 1 is that it does not decay or have the potential to pollute groundwater or contaminate land. BISBA says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The absence of criteria and guidance on how these attributes are to be determined is unfortunate and we urge DoE to address this issue."</p></blockquote>
Some of the generic categories of waste that fall into categories other than category 1 and trigger the £7 rate may contain sub-set wastes that are inert and inactive and could justifiably trigger the £2 rather than the £7 rate.<br><br>
Bricks are inert or inactive. According to the Building Employers Confederation bricks come into category 1 and will attract a £2 rate. In steelmaking the furnaces are lined with refractory bricks, which are made from brick clay and ceramic. Whereas ceramic can be described as inert and inactive, there is uncertainty as to whether refractory bricks contain a significant element of inert or inactive waste so as to justify them being in category 1. Such issues are being discussed in other industries with a significant waste stream that has traditionally gone to landfill.<br><br>
Has the producer responsibility group, which is the industrial group that advises the Department of the Environment on waste issues, been consulted about the national waste classification scheme? At what point was the CBI's environment forum sub-group consulted and when will it respond on waste classification? When will the responses of those major organisations be available to Members of Parliament and to the general public? How will the Government determine conflicts that may arise over the next few months as the waste classification scheme is established? What is the Government's deadline for the final draft of the categorisation of different elements of waste? When will Members of Parliament and the public be informed?<br><br>

12 noon<br><br>
I understand from many of the businesses that have sent us briefings that this is the crux of the matter. We are framing a tax that will have a significant effect on their businesses, yet no one knows what the full effect will be. The consultation exercise has only just begun and the deadline is 31 January. Consideration of representations from businesses is hardly under way. I wonder how the consultation process will work and whether we can be assured that, where there is real concern about classification of a specific element of waste, a satisfactory appeal mechanism will be in place. The key issue is whether a particular category of waste has been fairly placed in the £2 or £7 group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we move on from the clause, I should like to explain that one of the reasons why I supported the third band was that I was conscious of the premium on landfill space. I believed that the third band would persuade people to consider other options.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain the contradiction between Government policy set out in "Making Waste Work" and comments made by the chairman of the Environmental Services Association in the Palace of Westminster yesterday evening? The Government's perspective on the availability of landfill sites is set out on page 64 of "Making Waste Work". It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the time being, void space at a national level is generally available to meet requirements."</p></blockquote>
A subsequent paragraph states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Over the country as a whole, there appears to be adequate rate of generation of new void space for now, though there are divergent views on this, and further work is necessary … In the longer-term it is likely that some regions may begin to encounter shortages of suitable void space that can be used for landfill purposes".</p></blockquote>
However, the person with his finger on the pulse in environmental matters is Mr. Neil, chairman of the Environmental Services Association. He told me and other hon. Members last night:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a serious threat that landfill capacity beyond the Millennium will be insufficient to meet future demand".</p></blockquote>
This is 1996: beyond the millennium is only four years away. Mr. Neil continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"The present planning regime does not allow for the landbanking of suitable sites to meet future demand with the consequence that existing capacity is rapidly depleting."</p></blockquote>
If existing landfill capacity is, as Mr. Neil—a man who knows his onions—says, "rapidly depleting", is not that another reason for supporting a third band to discourage landfilling of material that could be disposed of in other ways?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pendle has misunderstood the purpose of the tax which is precisely to use landfill less and to seek other ways of dealing with waste. If we have come this far in Committee without the hon. Gentleman grasping that, I do not know what more I can say. The purposes were clearly spelt out on the Floor of the House.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
Bafflingly, the hon. Gentleman voted against clause 36 which authorises the tax. Perhaps his support for the tax is very recent. The Government are introducing tax, in close consultation with the Department of the Environment, to encourage other means of disposal.<br><br>
Shortages of landfill space are emerging in some parts of the country, although that is not a general phenomenon, and there is plenty of land in other areas. Whether or not there is a shortage, however, it is still undesirable for landfilling to be the first resort for the disposal of most waste.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hillsborough stressed the need for consultation, which I fully accept. That is why the tax will not be brought into effect until October, even though it was first announced in the 1994 Budget. That gives us plenty of time to work on the details and to consult landfill operators and waste producers who are affected—particularly commercial waste operators.<br><br>
The hon. Lady mentioned borderline cases, which should be treated with care. Some waste, which obviously falls into the inert and inactive category, was mentioned in the consultation document. Such waste includes most rocks and soils, such as clay, sand, gravel and topsoil; cement materials, including glass, ceramics and concrete; processed or prepared mineral or carbon materials that have not been used or contaminated, such as moulding sand, clay, other mineral absorbents and man-made fibres, such as glass fibre, silica, mica and abrasives.<br><br>
It is clear that it would be absurd to include such detail in primary legislation. The list is far from exhaustive, and we have not even started on the refractory bricks that the hon. Lady mentioned. That makes the case for delegating such detail to secondary legislation, which will, of course, be introduced in plenty of time so that the trade and other users can make their dispositions before the October deadline.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister be a little more specific? it is easy to say "plenty of time", but it means little. Does he mean in this Session?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to give a date now because we are still discussing the definitions with several users. However, it is better to take more time and reach the right definitions than to make snap decisions that we might regret later. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield spoke about the red mud effluent that is produced by an industrial process with which he is familiar. We should take careful note of such examples before we classify what is or is not inactive waste.<br><br>
The hon. Lady mentioned category I waste, which appears in the Department of the Environment's draft classification. That is a good start, but we might move beyond it by including additional waste material that does not currently fall into that category.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister on the timing. If the secondary legislation is not introduced in this Session, the tax will be introduced before it.</span></p>

BODIES CONCERNED WITH THE ENVIRONMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 29, line 38, after "protection", insert "or enhancement".<br><br>
Opposition Members do not have a problem or quarrel with clause 45. As far as we are concerned, it is central to the question of whether the landfill tax will be a Treasury tool or a genuinely green tax that can be used to support the environment and those commercial firms and charitable or even voluntary organisations whose aim is to protect or enhance it.<br><br>
We want the clause to include the words "or enhancement" because we feel that that would allow the clause to be interpreted more flexibly. The phrase "protection of the environment" could be interpreted so narrowly that the proposed body might find that it was unable to approve a particular body to receive a payback from the tax, even if it believed that that body met the fundamental objectives of the tax credit scheme.<br><br>
We understand from the Department of the Environment's press release, which was issued on environment budget day, that the credit mentioned in clause 45 would be limited to 90 per cent. of the contribution up to a maximum of 20 per cent. of the landfill tax bill. Perhaps the Minister could confirm whether our understanding is correct. The press release also set out the general rules regarding the creation and administration of environmental trusts, including the range of permitted activities.<br><br>
There is much interest—among those in the community and in industry—in environmental technology and in measures to upgrade industrial processes so that they do not pollute and affect future generations. On the other side, the public in general are interested in establishing their own environmental and conservation groups.<br><br>
Each of the small communities that make up my constituency has an established conservation group. They include Grenoside conservation group, Oughtlbridge conservation group and the Loxley Valley conservation society among others. Stocksbridge steel valley forum is another group which is supported by the industrial works in the valley as well as by local individuals. If the environmental trusts are to capture the public imagination and get people's support they must get some payback from the landfill tax, or from what clause 45 describes as the tax credit.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The proposal to recycle—a good environmental term—money to conservation groups with environmental interests is imaginative and welcome. As we have discussed—and I hope that the Minister will elaborate on this—some of the money may go back into the more beneficial sectors of the waste industry. Certainly, we hope that the industry will take this opportunity to demonstrate that it is in the front line of environmental protection. However, environmental protection can be interpreted differently by different people. If it is interpreted too narrowly, the enormous opportunity to protect and enhance the environment that is embodied in clause 45 could be missed.<br><br>
I should like to mention organisations such as the Groundwork Trusts. Those bodies are industry-based but are also supported by local authorities throughout the country. As the name implies, the concern is with environmental enhancement of the ground, reclamation and work to transform polluted industrial areas into land fit for housing, new industry or leisure pursuits. The Groundwork Trusts will monitor the landfill tax to see whether their own worthwhile projects get the help that they deserve.<br><br>
I am sure hon. Members will want to chip in with examples from their own constituencies, but the amendment is not antagonistic. It has been moved to ensure that we explore the full range, significance and meaning of the environmental trust and find out how organisations will benefit from the tax credit arrangements in clause 45.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the clause's proposals in principle, but as ever the devil is in the detail. In many cases, the details of the scheme and the conditions relating to the rebate are not available. That is part of the problem that has been described this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle.<br><br>
On the basis of the information that we have, my hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough noted that there is anxiety about the way the word "protection" may be interpreted differently by different people. The definition may be too narrow, and that is why the amendment suggests that the word "enhancement" should be inserted after "protection". The proposal has been supported by the Environmental Services Association, which, like Labour Members, has the good of the environment at heart.<br><br>
We are concerned about what the trusts will do and who will do it. The press releases state that the trusts will be involved in research and development and remedial work on landfill sites. No one can be opposed to research and development but we already know a lot about the area—perhaps we should put money into new policies and initiatives instead. There is concern that the trusts will subsidise irresponsible landfill site operators and, again, that the money could be better spent.<br><br>
The second concern is about who will run the trusts. As far as we understand it, it will be private sector non-profit distributing bodies—although they may be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
profit-making—and there is worry that they will lack public accountability and transparency, as do similar environmental bodies. However they are set up, the trusts should be encouraged to work in partnership with local authorities because one of my major concerns about the landfill tax is its effect on local authorities. Edinburgh council estimates that it will pay £1 million a year in tax and, given that its budget is vigorously capped, that means £1 million taken from other services. It, and no doubt other councils, would like to use some of the money from the landfill tax to develop alternative methods of waste disposal: in my views, preferably recycling, not incineration. As a footnote to our earlier debate, I tell the Committee that Edinburgh council stopped disposing of waste by incineration 10 years ago on the grounds that landfill was more environmentally friendly.<br><br>
We should encourage recycling. One of the recycling technologies is material recovery facilities; I hope that some of the money from the trusts can be redirected to local authorities so that they can invest in that technology. I would also like a carrot approach of encouraging recycling as well as the stick approach of the landfill tax. Beyond the technology, we want the Government to boost the market for recycled products because at the moment that is a fundamental disincentive to recycling. It is not certain that landfill site operators will want to put their money into trusts; they will get a 90 per cent. subsidy for doing so, but that cannot exceed 20 per cent. of the landfill tax that they pay. That is not a powerful incentive and if hon. Members wished to be cynical, they could argue that landfill operators will not put money into trusts that will reduce the amount of business that they get.<br><br>
While we welcome the idea of environmental trusts, we are anxious that they should operate more broadly. Alternative ways of funding them should also be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In supporting the amendment, I shall confine my remarks to the various Groundwork Trusts throughout the country: the Groundwork Foundation and its associated companies, principally the Black Country Urban Forestry Unit and the National Urban Forestry Unit.<br><br>
It is important that the legislation is flexible enough to allow the Groundwork Foundation and its associated trusts and companies to benefit from the tax breaks arising from the legislation. That is important because, from my knowledge of the Groundwork Foundation, most of its work is to do with environmental improvements or enhancements, rather than with protecting the environment. Therefore, my anxiety is that the legislation as it stands might be narrowly construed as precluding the Groundwork Foundation from being a qualifying organisation. That would be a great pity.<br><br>
The black country Groundwork Trust does much good work in my constituency and in neighbouring constituencies and has been highly successful in making environmental improvements to run-down industrial estates. It has done much good work in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
greening the verges and neighbouring areas around our railway lines. It is worthy of support.<br><br>
Similarly, the Black Country Urban Forestry Unit has been a pioneering initiative. It is not very often that an initiative starts in the black country. The unit has planted several thousand trees all over the black country and it recently received the Government's approbation by succeeding in its bid to the single regeneration fund. It has also received national lottery money. In fact, it has been so successful that it has spawned the National Urban Forestry Unit. I was pleased to attend a meeting over the road a fortnight ago when the Secretary of State for the Environment spoke at the launch of the National Urban Forestry Unit and praised it. The unit receives Department of the Environment support and has an exciting programme of environmental enhancements. It would be useful if that body could benefit from the landfill tax as it might not be able to if the legislation is narrowly construed.<br><br>
I must comment in passing that during his typically lucid speech, littered with good jokes, the Secretary of State for the Environment made the amazing assertion that trees were the most politically uncontentious issue in his Department. At the same time, protesters were hanging off trees in Newbury.<br><br>
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply to the debate on our amendment. I am worried that if the amendment is not accepted, the Groundwork Foundation, its trusts and the various forestry unit organisations will be unable to benefit from the landfill tax. If we do not press the amendment, I would like assurances from the Minister that the Groundwork Foundation can benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Treasury taketh and now it proposes to give back some of what it takes in the form of credits to set up environmental trusts. When he replies to the points made in our discussion, will the Minister address the issue of whether the landfill operators are the appropriate bodies to run the environmental trusts and to be the channel through which credits will be allocated? Landfill operators have very little incentive to reduce waste. They will pass on the £2 or £7 tax—whatever rate it is set at—to the companies that want them to receive material that must go into holes in the ground. From their point of view, the more waste they get, the more profitable and successful they are. Surely by putting the credits at the end of the disposal chain we have got it hack to front. We should first focus on the minimisation of waste, secondly on recycling or the useful application of waste—reference was made to the much more innovative public support in Europe for combined heat and power waste disposal units—and only lastly should we seek to finance the examination of waste disposal through the proposed credits.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Of course, the management of the landfill sites is important and requires every encouragement. I am concerned, however, that the money will not go into the Consolidated Fund and tax revenue, but will go to the waste industry. It will go to landfill operators and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
will not be used either to minimise waste or to encourage recycling.<br><br>
I support the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leith about the need to involve local authority environmental departments. They have the expertise, because over the years they have had to consider many of the relevant problems. They are the first point of reference for any planning application for the development of a waste disposal facility. Given the continual downward pressure on local government finance, it is absurd that this important new initiative under the landfill tax umbrella will not make use of the expertise of local authorities.<br><br>
I want to put to the Minister some points raised, after thoughtful consideration, by British steel and iron companies that are united under the umbrella of the British Steel and Iron Producers Association. It suggests that the environmental trusts should not be mere adjuncts to the landfill companies, but that they should involve sophisticated information bank listings. It also believes that the various regions should have centres of excellence that provide first-rate information on proven methods of waste minimisation and re-use—it should not be a London-centred agency. Credits should go to encouraging research at specific facilities where waste can be analysed and assessed.<br><br>
I accept the Minister's point about the need for secondary legislation on the detailed application of the measure, but in a way we are signing a blank cheque because we do not have the exact criteria that will be used to determine whether the £2 or the £7 rate will apply. People involved in any process that produces waste should be given first-class advice on waste minimisation and recycling. That is especially important for small and medium-sized enterprises.<br><br>
It would be helpful if the credits were directed to the establishment of centres of expertise and advice for treatment of waste at source. Large, responsible companies already undertake that, but there are fewer larger companies in this country and the smaller companies have fewer and fewer resources to undertake such work.<br><br>
Although hon. Members on both sides of the Committee applaud the idea of allowing credits to be used for funding bodies that help to improve the environment, we should go further than protection and seriously consider the enhancement of the environment, as proposed in the amendment. We should move credits and expertise upstream to stop waste being developed at the point of production rather than provide extra bunce for companies which, at the end of the day, have a direct economic interest in encouraging landfill use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight flavour of suspicion over the Treasury voice in the debate. Can we be an environmental organisation? Customs and Excise and the Treasury are both environmentally responsible, especially when being so is compatible with tax-raising duties. Happily, we have found a tax that is also environmentally sound. Our provisions for establishing environmental trusts put beyond doubt our environmental motives.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
I acknowledge that the hon. Member for Hillsborough has tabled a probing amendment and I appreciate the spirit behind it. The amendment would add "enhancement" to "protection" in one part of the clause but not in another. In that sense, it is technically defective, but that is unimportant because it has allowed us to have a useful debate on trusts generally and, in particular, on whether the enhancement concept is necessary.<br><br>
In practice, the distinction between enhancement and protection is unimportant. I recall the Environmental Protection Bill 1989, which became an Act in 1990. It was largely the achievement of Sir David Trippier who thought that it might have been better to call it the Environmental Enhancement Bill. If a factory was prevented from carrying on a polluting activity, we debated whether that would enhance or protect the environment. In the end, it was a wholly unimportant decision. The important point is that the 1990 Act has become the foundation of pollution control and environmental protection today. Similarly, Groundwork Trusts were established at that time by the same Minister. I acknowledge the good work that was done. Showing that environmental objectives—to be set out in subsequent legislation—are being pursued will qualify for trust status.<br><br>
I wish to draw the Committee's attention to the proposed objectives, which meet many of the concerns that have been expressed. The objectives will be widely drawn to include research into and development of more sustainable waste management practices. That may include research into recycling, composting, energy recovery and the overriding need to reduce the amount of waste that is produced in the first place. Approved purposes will also include the collection and dissemination of information about waste management and more sustainable waste management practices.<br><br>
Approved purposes will also ensure that money can be applied to so-called orphan sites—those whose original owners or operators have long since vanished. In such cases, no one can be traced and no one is responsible for the site. It would be an environmental enhancement if such sites could be cleaned up and restored. A site operator could not, however, use trust money to clear up a site for which he was responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that a tax credit for such operations could be problematic? The Department of the Environment budget already makes provision for those operations through its derelict land and reclamation grant. If the Bill replaces provisions in the Department of the Environment budget, it would negate the environmental principle and justify our scepticism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not intend the measure to replace existing activity—it is an addition to it. We want approved purposes to be widely drawn, but we also want to prevent abuse. Operators cannot benefit from the expenditure, and trusts must be nonprofit distributing. Operators will, however, have a legitimate interest in the running of the trusts; they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
will, after all, contribute to 10 per cent. of their cost and might want a sense of ownership and responsibility.<br><br>
I was asked about local authority involvement. There is nothing to prevent local authorities from being project partners in specific instances. They cannot, however, be site operators unless they own the sites.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee agrees that the provision will enable environmental enhancement or protection to be carried out in practice. It will be partly funded from rebates and, therefore, indirectly by the taxpayer. It will also be directly funded from operators' contributions. The approved objectives will be sufficiently wide to encourage the general enhancement of old sites and research and development of new ways to dispose of and handle waste. They will also prevent abuse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that local authorities would be unaffected unless they were site operators. If, like my local authority in Lancashire, they are site operators, they will be subject to the tax. No provision is, however, made in the standard spending assessment for Lancashire or any local authority to seek compensation for the money that they spend on the landfill tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention returns us to the debate that we had on Second Reading about who pays the tax and who benefits from it. As always with a new tax or tax reform, there will be winners and losers. Some companies and local authorities will pay more in landfill tax than they receive from the cut in national insurance contributions. As I said on Second Reading, that will be true of local authorities overall. That is an inescapable feature of the new tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can this be a polluter-pays tax? Local authorities collect other people's waste and take it to landfills. Is the Minister suggesting that they pass costs on through their council tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have covered that point, too. We seek to alter behaviour and create incentives to use alternatives to landfilling. Local authorities are best placed to introduce recycling, alternative waste collection and incineration schemes as alternatives to sending the refuse to landfill. The organisation best placed to shift that behaviour will bear the tax. The incentive will be in the right place.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General put forward a list of services that the Government recommend must be cut in local authorities that are —capped and are therefore restricted in what they can spend? Such cuts will be necessary if those local authorities are to have alternative methods of waste disposal.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All those matters, including the prospects of new taxes, were taken into account by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment when he set the revenue support grant and the capping criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a question for the Minister. How much extra do the Treasury and the Department of the Environment calculate that local authorities will have to pay as a result of the tax? If the Minister cannot give the Committee a figure, it is irresponsible for the Government to leave local authority treasuries unable to calculate what the tax will cost them over the next two or three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point about local authorities has received no satisfactory response from the Minister. The Committee has, rightly, discussed the effect on industry, but local authorities are the pivot for landfill waste disposal and for the country's whole waste disposal mechanism. By and large, local authorities are the operators of landfill sites and dumping sites in their area. That makes them liable for the tax and current projections for Sheffield put the amount at £1.8 million per year.<br><br>
Some of that amount will be recouped by national insurance contributions, but local authorities do not expect to make anything but a loss in that arrangement. Some money will be recouped from the charges that local authorities can place on other operators disposing of waste at local authority sites. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leith said in respect of environmental trusts, the larger local authorities are the leaders, drivers and motivators of new environmental techniques and recycling schemes. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East and I spent one of our junkets together inspecting a composting initiative in Milton Keynes. In my area, local authorities have been the driving force behind combined heat and power schemes against some of the worst inclinations of Government and others.<br><br>
Local authorities are the potential beneficiaries of environmental trusts, in which they must participate as key partners. That role must be made absolutely secure when the trusts are set up. If it is not, the expertise and initiative of local authority environmental health and cleansing departments, which drive the policy forward, will be lost to an otherwise positive initiative.<br><br>
The Minister said that the Groundwork Foundation could be defined as an environmental trust, which is welcome. I still feel that if the environmental trusts are to be really beneficial and capture people's imagination, they need to promote the environment in people's communities. That would take on board the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe, which had been put to us by the steel industry. I gave the example of steel valley forums, which are themselves environmental partnership forums. They need a way of benefiting from the environmental trusts, which could receive the 20 per cent. credit from the landfill tax.<br><br>
Finally, I am extremely concerned that as soon as money is earmarked in a big way to be put into the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
reclamation and restoration of derelict orphan sites, there will be nothing left for research, information gathering, help for the Groundwork Foundation and for combined heat and power plants. Will the Minister say more about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is being unduly pessimistic about the approved purposes. The restoration of orphan sites is just one example of what could constitute a necessary and popular local project.<br><br>
Some local areas suffer from sites that were abandoned long ago. Part of my constituency used to be an old coalfield. The last pit was shut in 1968 but it has left behind a residue of landfilled waste. No one is interested in clearing it up because it has passed out of the ownership of British Coal and its successor bodies. The new scheme might be an opportunity for an organisation—perhaps the Groundwork Foundation, working with or without the local authority—to form a scheme to clear up the area with money contributed from a trust that is set up by a local landfill operator.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point, but of course there are such sites, they are well known, particularly in old coal mining areas. Funds along European or regeneration budget lines can already be tapped for reclaiming those sites. I am concerned at the clear possibility that trust money could replace moneys that are already available for undertaking that sort of work—which everyone wants to do and which is generally being done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the case that I mentioned, nothing has been done over the years; clearly it has not caught the eye of those who distribute the grant funds that the hon. Lady mentioned. It is envisaged that the work of the trusts should be an addition to what is being done. I hope that she will welcome the objectives, which are fairly generally approved and which certainly go well beyond what is presently able to be grant-funded. To my knowledge, there is nothing as focused as this provision on the question of dealing with waste, clearing up old tips and conducting research into better waste management practices.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham asked about capping limits and local authority finance. I am advised that local authority capping limits include about £30 million in respect of waste regulation functions. Those will transfer to the new environment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
agency, which is due to be set up on 1 April 1996 and local authorities will benefit by that amount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government understand why we on the Opposition are a little distrustful of green motives when they are introduced in the form of increases in VAT on pensioners' heating allowances and other such measures. We wholeheartedly welcome the notion that an element of the fiscal measure will be recycled into environmentally beneficial operations—added research, information and new ideas and developments in environmental management—so that dangerous landfill is really put at the bottom of the waste hierarchy. I am sure that the Minister will be aware, however, that clause 45 will be the test of whether the Government's intentions operate in practice.<br><br>
Along with other members of the Select Committee on the Environment, and the environment agency, we shall monitor closely to what extent the element of fiscal tax that goes into environmental trusts and the bodies associated with them really exists to benefit the environment. The issue is on test.<br><br>
Our amendment was a probing one to provoke a debate and to let the Government know that they are on probation on the issue.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

It so happens that I was reading the minutes of the Committee's sitting on 6 February and I noticed that I am not listed as having attended the Committee although I apparently voted during the sitting. Perhaps <i>Hansard</i> could amend the record at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those who understand these things heard the hon. Gentleman's comments. I am told that the matter will be corrected in the bound volume.</span></p>
<p><i>Clauses 46 to 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock,</i> THE CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</i></p>
