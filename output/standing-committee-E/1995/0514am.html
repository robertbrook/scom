<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In drawing to a close my remarks on the amendments, I wish to focus a few issues. Much suspicion has been rightly felt by people who are critical of the Child Support Agency and the way in which it has dealt with child support. I refer to couples. one of whom is claiming welfare benefit, principally income support. Ministers have made it clear that when no one is receiving income support or drawing welfare benefit, couples are free to make their own arrangements about child support. Indeed, when that issue was raised at a recent all-party group, to which I referred at our last sitting, the Minister talked about savings to the taxpayer. No reference was made to family support and the eradication of child poverty.<br><br>
My amendments, if properly incorporated into the Bill, would make it clear that adequate levels of child support are necessary for all families, not only those who are considered to be a drain on the taxpayer. Far too much emphasis has been placed on targeting women who are on income support and trying to bring up their children, rather than ensuring that all children of families going through the divorce process are properly supported.<br><br>
I am grateful to the National Association of Family Mediation and Conciliation Services for making available some information about the impact of the CSA on the association's professional role as family mediators. It has made it clear that when couples use mediation to sort out such matters, mediators ensure that they are made fully aware of the actual or likely CSA calculations. They are told about the impact of the formula on all their arrangements and decisions.<br><br>
Particular attention is drawn to the situation that will apply if either party is already on income support or may have to claim it in the future as a side effect, or consequence, of the divorce. The couple are told about the way in which the CSA operates. No calculations are made until an accurate figure is obtained by them from the CSA—although I hesitate to question what an accurate figure from the CSA might be, given that two thirds of its calculations are wrong. The possible effect of the operation of the agency upon the couple is always explored and a ballpark figure is put to them. There are, of course, consequences for second families.<br><br>
National Family Mediation works within the Child Support Agency formula. Mediators help clients to understand the implications of the CSA and assist them to arrive at the so-called ballpark figure. The temporary figure becomes a benchmark for negotiation and, as an outsider, it seems to me that that is a determining factor in assessing the financial arrangements. Family mediators want to have an in-house facility so that clients can arrive at their own child support figure. Such a facility could be a kiosk or a software package, but that is not possible in the light of current funding.<br><br>
It seems that the impact of the Child Support Agency on some aspects of family mediation has been malign. Disputes between couples, we are told,
<br><blockquote><p>"have sometimes been further inflamed, or even caused, by the application of the CSA formula. Mediators therefore explain … to the couple"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
the way in which the CSA operates.<br><br>
National Family Mediation also says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mediators often work where there are disputes between first and second families and here also the CSA may figure in the conflict … There is no doubt that the formula has made mediation a more difficult and complex matter, partly as a result of the incongruities that sometimes arise in relation to the application of the formula and partly because it is a fixed item in an otherwise
negotiable set of options.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Mediators have to contend frequently with the great anxiety caused for the couple by the CSA."</p></blockquote>
The association stresses:
<br><blockquote><p>"An advantage of the CSA however is that it lays down an expectation of realistic financial support for children"— [<i>Interruption.</i>]</p></blockquote>
No one would disagree with that as a principle in assessing child support. For far too long, there has been an assumption that it is adequate to pay £5, £10 or £15 a week for the support of a child—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is rather a lot of subterranean noise in the Room. I understand that it may be necessary and permissible to exchange brief notes, but if hon. Members need to have extended conversations will they please have them outside. If they need to exchange brief remarks, will they please be sensitive to the cumulative effect of many such remarks, which can interrupt the Committee's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.<br><br>
For far too long, people have made unrealistic assumptions about the costs of bringing up a child. One of the difficulties is that there has been too much focus on income support rates, which—as everyone who has had responsibility for bringing up a child will know—are totally inadequate for that purpose.<br><br>
If, under the amendments, the Lord Chancellor were to issue guidelines or rules, direction should be given to mediators—and to the courts that will be asked to endorse and validate consent agreements—to consider the local foster care rates, which give a more realistic idea of the costs of child support. The rates given by local authorities to parents for bringing up foster children would be a proper benchmark for couples assessing support for their children.<br><br>
As the CSA currently operates, it will not be able to run alongside the Bill. To say that they could run alongside each other would be to suggest that there was at least some harmony and that the CSA and the Bill were in tandem. In fact, they are in direct conflict; one will torpedo the other. The Bill cannot work unless couples are directed to make decisions about all aspects of the financial consequences of their divorce.<br><br>
The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 states that in deciding the appropriateness of a financial agreement, the paramount consideration for a court must be the children. However, neither the courts nor couples will be able to discharge that obligation—and mediators will not find it easy to resolve issues—if the CSA,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
which has in some ways rightly been discredited, is trying to bring about a set of circumstances that are unachievable because it is looking at the wrong target.<br><br>
We should be talking about the mature resolution of adult disputes, about a proper level of financial support for children, about continuing contact between children and their parents and about respect for second families. That cannot happen under the present system. Parties should be given the responsibility, in tandem with mediators and the courts, of sorting out the financial consequences of the breakdown of the marriage. Such matters should not be subjected to a formula imposed by Government diktat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>; I support my hon Friend's amendments. The Bill will be unworkable unless we make such amendments. As it is, the CSA is lurking around the corner, waiting until the mediation process is completed and some understanding has been reached between the parents and the children. At our second sitting on 30 April, I said that it was almost impossible to have proper, sound and successful mediation if the CSA were lurking outside.<br><br>
Mediation may be successful even if the marriage is not saved, and the couple may come to a sensible arrangement, especially about the welfare of the children, but we know from experience that something will go wrong once the CSA becomes involved. It can drive a wedge between sensible, caring parents and between the parents and the children, causing problems with financial arrangements and access. Some people say about the access arrangements, "The more I keep the kids, the less I shall have to pay." That is not the right reason to want to have the children. The CSA can create an atmosphere contrary to what we believe should be created by legislation. We should be protecting the children and those who help parents through that traumatic experience.<br><br>
The CSA has often ruined perfectly good arrangements and even relationships. We know from our constituency surgeries of some of the tragedies that have occurred because of the complications caused by the tightness of CSA rulings. That is not best for the children. The rules should be more pliable to allow for factors that may be different from one case to another. The rules do they allow personal concessions to be made between the parents.<br><br>
I know of children who, although sad that their parents have separated, have come to terms with it because arrangements have been made for their benefit through mediation. In some cases, however, although the mother was likely to benefit financially through the CSA's intervention she has turned away from it to try to save the relationship between the children and their father—or even between the parents themselves. It is ludicrous that although we spend much of our time saying that the children should be considered as precious and paramount, we are debating legislation that is likely to drive a wedge

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
between the parents and the children and can only make matters worse.<br><br>
The Bill will not achieve its objective unless we seriously address the problem of the CSA. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East is right to say that if such matters are not dealt with, the majority of the Bill will be unworkable and, frankly, not especially honest. I hope that the amendments will be accepted.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief speech in support of the amendments. At our last sitting the hon. Member for Bristol, East spoke forcefully in support of her amendments. Clearly, she was speaking from considerable experience and what she said made much sense.<br><br>
Under the old procedure under section 41 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, it was not possible to obtain a decree nisi unless the judge was satisfied that all the arrangements for the children were as they should be. In other words, the children's rights were paramount in any form of matrimonial law. That is not the current position, so children's rights have been eroded. The current law is less satisfactory because divorces can be granted without adequate attention being paid to the arrangements for the children.<br><br>
In my experience, the statement of arrangements form, which solicitors complete, is the last item to be filed. The divorce petition is important; certificates on reconciliation slightly less so; and then there are the arrangements for the children. When we went to court, we often found that those arrangements were very different from those that were scribbled down at the start of the proceedings. Clearly, something must be done about that. The amendments are well thought out and would undoubtedly strengthen the position of children in such circumstances.<br><br>
We all know that there will be a lobby of Parliament tomorrow on CSA legislation. All hon. Members have long-running experience of the Act—probably the worst piece of legislation this century, if not longer. We all have full postbags about it. Yesterday, I discussed the Bill and forthcoming amendments with some prominent family lawyers, one ofwhom asked, "Where does the CSA fit into all this?" I did not know. Several hon. Members have made the same point in this debate. As we do not know where the CSA will fit in, surely, in due course, the Minister will tell us what the overlap will be between the Bill and the CSA.<br><br>
The courts have long attempted to nurture clean-break orders. Over the past few years, several practice directions have encouraged the use of such orders. That is sensible because they are once-and-for-all orders. Typically, the husband would give his former wife the matrimonial home and the equity therein, so the children would have a roof over their heads. The important point is that there would be no need for further, periodic referrals, perhaps every 18 months or two years. to the court, taking up its time and, worse, involving the children and the parties in further acrimony.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
The use of clean-break orders has made good sense. It is now usual to use them, whereas 10 years ago they were slightly unusual. It would not be useful for the Bill to run counter to the tendency to make such orders as there would be a return to the old acrimony. Parties would have to go back and forth to court. taking up its time, when such matters could be dealt with elsewhere with far less acrimony using more acceptable types of order.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, East referred to Martin orders, which have become unusual, I am pleased to say. However, under the Bill they will reemerge with a vengeance. That will not be helpful to the parties to a divorce, to the practitioners or to the courts. We do not want a resurgence of those orders, which became outmoded because they were clearly not in accordance with the way in which matrimonial law was developing.<br><br>
The amendments are based on good sense. They are practical and they provide a longstop to protect the interests and rights of children. I fully support them and I hope that they will find favour with the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Member for Bristol, East opened the debate by saying that she would do her best to restrict her remarks to issues that were entirely related to the Bill, rather than the more general issue of the Child Support Agency, she subsequently talked at some length about her views on the operation and performance of the CSA. Given her role on the parliamentary group, that is not really surprising. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) also spoke about the CSA and made his fairly negative views quite clear.<br><br>
This is not really the forum for a debate on the Child Support Agency, but it may be necessary for me to set the record straight on one or two facts about the CSA and its current performance. The CSA replaced a court system for determining child maintenance that had created inconsistent and low levels of maintenance, averaging just £23 a week at the inception of the agency. Too often, mothers and children were left in poverty and the taxpayer had to pick up a large and growing bill for basic income support. Some of the factors that led to the creation of a structure within which that responsibility was passed to the taxpayer have been touched on in our debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that he did not practise in family law, so perhaps it is not altogether surprising that he should say that the burden fell on the taxpayer. Had he practised in matrimonial law he would know that several high-powered practice directions were issued 10 years ago telling those who had the conduct of divorce cases to avoid at all costs imposing a burden on the taxpayer and to examine carefully and closely all other options. That clearly contradicts what the Minister said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A practice direction is one thing; it is quite another to point out what was actually
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
happening. I am rather surprised that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) should assert that, as from 10 years ago, the burden did not fall on the taxpayer. It may well be that I did not practice divorce law but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, I was managing partner of a practice originated by Leo Abse, who was the architect of the divorce law reforms in the late 1960s, so I have some knowledge of such matters—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall not be drawn by sedentary interventions, from wherever they come and however seductive they may be.<br><br>
Prior to the creation of the CSA in April 1993, 70 per cent. of absent parents did not make regular child maintenance payments. In 1995–96 the agency collected and arranged maintenance of more than £301 million, with an average of almost £40 from those absent parents in receipt of earned income. Payments of maintenance to parents with care, involving over 600,000 individual payments, have been made within 10 working days in 97 per cent. of cases, against a target of 90 per cent.<br><br>
Following what we would all recognise as a difficult start, accuracy rates have improved significantly and further improvements are expected in the coming year. Improving accuracy has been the agency's highest priority in the past year and those figures are, in my view, a testament to its commitment to improving the quality of the service that it delivers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is rather a fine line between an encomium to the Child Support Agency and its relevance to the clause. I ask the Minister to tread that fine line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged for that guidance, Mr. O'Hara. Without it the wide-ranging speech of the hon Member for Bristol, East might have tempted me into a response to her points which she made at very great length.<br><br>
The CSA is saving the taxpayer more than £1.4 billion. The hon. Lady said that separating couples would be more reluctant to agree clean-break settlements that allow the mother and children to keep the marital home as the CSA would be waiting in the wings to seek child maintenance from the father if the mother went to benefit. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) made a telling intervention during the hon. Lady's speech. He made it clear that in such circumstances it cannot be right to expect the taxpayer to pick up the bill for bringing up those children. It has been recognised hitherto, by all parties, that there can never be a clean break between a parent and a child.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked how child support legislation fits in with the Bill. The answer is straightforward—nothing in existing child support legislation prevents separating couples from agreeing their own financial arrangements for their children. The Government welcome that and encourage separating couples to consider such matters seriously. However, the Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
does not oust the CSA's jurisdiction and the existence of maintenance agreements between separated parents cannot prevent either party from making a voluntary application to the CSA for a child support assessment. Equally, if the parent with care, or his or her new partner, claims an income-related benefit, the CSA will seek a fair level of child maintenance from an absent parent who is able to pay, irrespective of the existence of a written agreement.<br><br>
Clause 9 already requires parties to have decided their financial arrangements before a divorce or separation order is made. That rightly encourages parties to focus on life after divorce so that the full financial impact of divorce is clear. The clause makes it clear that rights and liabilities for maintenance of children form part of the decisions about future financial arrangements. The amendments are therefore unnecessary.<br><br>
I should tell the Committee how those who deal with mediation deal with those issues in relation to the CSA. When couples use mediation to sort out financial and property matters and arrangements for children, the mediators ensure that full note is taken of the actual or likely CSA calculation. All couples are informed of the possible impact of the CSA formula on their arrangements. It is stressed that the balance of assets and financial responsibilities must take account of the actual or possible future effects of the CSA. If either party is, or may later be on income support as a part effect of the divorce, he or she is informed of how the CSA operates.<br><br>
No calculations will be made between the parties without an accurate CSA figure, which should be obtained from the CSA, as the hon. Member for Bristol, East said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to learn that the Government have again failed to think through the impact of their Bill on national life. Does the Minister seriously think that the Child Support Agency will be able to furnish such information in the time required for mediation, given its lamentable record in settling outstanding cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful for the Committee to know how the mediation organisations work. The Bill, irrespective of written agreements, does not oust the CSA's jurisdiction. What lies behind the group of the amendments was made clear by the hon. Member for Heeley, who is clearly hostile to the CSA. He generously shared that view with the Committee. But Parliament has set up a structure involving the CSA and this Bill does not oust its jurisdiction. Whatever written agreements there may be, as I have already told the hon. Member for Bristol, East, they will not prevent anyone from raising the issue with the Child Support Agency and asking for an assessment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Lester <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The National Family Mediation briefing says:
<br><blockquote><p>"An advantage of the CSA however is that it lays down an expectation of realistic financial support for children by the non-

residential parent that cannot be questioned and is therefore useful in mediation sessions."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Without wishing to trespass against your direction, Mr. O'Hara, I should say that we can see from the average settlements that there is much more concentration on realistic levels of maintenance required for the future. May I also mention the National Family Mediation's policy? Mediators help clients to understand the implications of the Child Support Agency and assist them to arrive at what has been described by the hon. Member for Bristol, East as a ballpark figure. That temporary figure is a benthmark for negotiation. The responsibility for acquiring a figure that might be used by the CSA belongs to the clients, not to the mediators.<br><br>
I turn to the other aspects of the amendments to which the hon. Member for Bristol, East spoke, especially the effect of removing the ill health, disability or injury of the child of the family from the set of circumstances in which the second exemption to the requirement to decide arrangements for the future would apply. At present, the second exemption applies when the applicant has taken reasonably practical steps in the period of reflection and consideration to decide the arrangements for the future, thereby satisfying the requirements of clause 9; but because of ill health, disability or injury to one of the parties or a child of the family, the applicant has been unable to finalise such arrangements.<br><br>
There are circumstances when the health of a child of the family would affect the ability of the parties to decide the future arrangements. For example, the ill health might be a direct result of abuse or violence from the other party, so it could be unsafe for the applicant to approach his or her partner to agree the necessary arrangements. Alternatively, a child of the family might be so ill or badly injured that the parties concentrate all their energies on assisting the child's recovery and tending him at his bedside. The last thing they could do at such a time of extreme trauma would be to divide up their possessions clinically. Although such circumstances would be rare, I believe that the stress and the trauma caused would be so great that it would be irresponsible to ignore it. I urge the Committee not to support the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I laboured under a misapprehension when I spoke in our previous sitting. I thought that the Minister had practised as a family lawyer, but I now hear that he was in the same practice as someone who knew something about family law. I shared my chambers with people who dealt with Chancery cases, but that does not mean that I knew anything about Chancery. With the greatest respect to the Minister, his remarks reaffirm my acceptance that he never did practise family law and knows little about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Child law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says "child law", but clearly he has no experience. I do not criticise him for that, but his remarks have concerned the Child Support Agency itself rather than the experience of people going through the mediation process.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Committee knows that there was an injunction from the Chair that we should talk only about the Bill and the amendment, but we seem to have discussed my hon. Friend the Minister's past legal practice and we are now coming back to the Child Support Agency, which is not mentioned in either the amendment or the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was allowing the hon. Member for Bristol, East to respond to specific remarks addressed to her by the Minister, and I trust that the hon. Lady will observe the injunction that I gave the Minister: she certainly has not transgressed yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.<br><br>
My amendment would ensure that what we are told are the spirit and intent of these proposals—based on the Lord Chancellor's White Paper—would be observed. This means that parties who are getting divorced would be required to resolve all financial matters, including child support arrangements—the Lord Chancellor used that phrase. The evidence and experience of the courts is that people are capable of doing that. From my experience, and from talking to practitioners, it seems that child support legislation has a malign effect and is an impediment to proper negotiation.<br><br>
It is no use the Minister talking of some theoretical practice. I am told by the Solicitors Family Law Association and by friends who are members of the Family Bar that the Child Support Agency's practices have had those effects, with the result that people are now refusing to agree to clean—break orders—a point raised from his experience by the hon. Member for Meirionydd Nant Conwy. I have never suggested that the CSA should be wound up: it should be there to enforce court orders and ensure that money is collected from persons liable for payment and given to whoever has care of the children, which is usually the mother.<br><br>
I make two further points. The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Sir J. Lester) quoted the paper from National Family Mediation, of which I received a copy. I acknowledged earlier that it made one positive point, which was that parties had at least been directed towards agreeing realistic amounts of support, along with local foster care rates. These are not national figures that give ludicrous averages. The Minister seems to think that there is an average figure for bringing up a child. The foster care rates are based on local living costs, the child's age and the rate currently paid to foster parents in their local authority area. It seems perfectly reasonable for the Lord Chancellor to introduce guidelines such as those in section 25 of the 1973 Act to direct parties to define realistic amounts of child support in areas where a couple, or parent with care, live. Amendment No. 100 would facilitate that.<br><br>
The Minister spoke of stress and trauma. The amendments seem to be a way of anticipating and eliminating the stress and trauma caused by child support legislation for couples going into mediation, and for the mediators. I said on another occasion that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
child support legislation will torpedo some important principles relating to the mature resolution of conflict.<br><br>
I have heard the Minister's response, and his outright rejection of the amendments, which seems to be very much the way things go. It seems that no matter what sense may be spoken, if it does not come from Conservative Members it cannot be received truth, which is typical of the macho culture which dominates this place. However, I reiterate that the amendments make great sense and shouild have the support of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to express on behalf of many members of the Committee my appreciation of the work put into the amendments by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) and of the care with which she formulated her arguments in this important debate.<br><br>
Not for the first time, I am disappointed by the Minister's response. He failed to address the central concerns expressed by my hon. Friends. Those concerns, and the amendments, are rooted in the real world; not in the world as it might become if the Bill is enacted but in the world of the practical experience of people who are wrestling, professionally and personally, with the problem of settling arrangements for children, often in a crisis.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East spoke about the practical interface between the provisions of the bill and the child Support Agency, and she was entitled to a more helpful, more generous response than she got. Solicitors, the counsel who subsequently seek to resolve matters in the course of ancillary proceedings and family mediators all attest to concerns about the impact of the CSA.<br><br>
Having heard the arguments, and having noted the Minister's lamentable response, Opposition members of the Committee will wholeheartedly support the amendments.</span></p>

A distressing situation exists for some Jewish women, who find it difficult to obtain a religious divorce—a get—when their husbands are being awkward. Subsection (3) goes some considerable way to doing something about that anomaly. The Jewish Marriage Council welcomes it and it has the support of the Board of Deputies of British Jews.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 10 is about stopping divorce going through in extreme cases of hardship. The hardship bar is the final safeguard of the Bill—its long stop. It protects the spouse who does not want to divorce.<br><br>
The law at present contains a hardship bar only for divorces obtained on the basis of a five-year separation. About 6 per cent. of divorces are affected. The bar is based on grave financial and other hardship and is outlined in section 5(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.<br><br>
Divorce on the basis of a five-year separation, with no fault admitted and no consent, was extremely controversial when introduced in 1969. We sometimes forget that. To stave off criticism of the then Divorce Reform Bill, the Government in 1969 introduced a hardship bar so that a party could stop a divorce if he or she would suffer hardship. The Bill's final wording was, as always, a compronise, and was designed to stop spurious litigation. Leo Abse, the sponsor of the Bill—[HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."] He is a famous man, known, I think, to my hon. Friend the Minister. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In these days, when everyone is concerned that there should be no unnecessary expenditure, particularly through the Legal Aid Fund, it would be most unfortunate if this defence were made, frivolously or for more sinister motives, and the court had to examine all the circumstances of the marriage and the interests of all concerned and squander its time in making such a prolonged inquest into every one of those cases when, in the end, it would prove unnecessary."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 October 1969; Vol. 788, c. 706.]</p></blockquote>
That gives a flavour of one side of that debate. Legislators at that time clearly thought that they had built in a real safeguard for a spouse who did not want a divorce against his or her will.<br><br>
When the Government introduced the Family Law Bill in the other place, the words of the hardship bar were taken directly from existing law. But the key change is that that wording will not apply to all divorces. The Government argued that as the hardship bar applied only to 6 per cent. of divorces—those based on five-year separation—that was a major step forward and the bar would potentially be available in all cases. Claims were made—by the Government, I think—that the hardship bar would prevent divorce on demand. The White Paper stated that many consultees considered that the bar, in existing law, provided "significant protection" for the spouse who did not want a divorce. The Government also argued, in paragraph 4.47 of their White Paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"The jurisprudence on the use of this bar is now well established".</p></blockquote>
Because that was the Government's view, one might have been forgiven for thinking that it was a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
serious issue. It was said to apply to all divorces, that it would be used in many cases and would provide real protection for an innocent spouse who did not want a divorce.<br><br>
The argument began to unravel when eminent legal authorities, such as Stephen Cretney, Ruth Deech and others, pointed out that the famous hardship bar, which had been lauded in the White Paper, had stopped only one divorce in 25 years and that grave financial hardship had prevented divorce in only a handful of cases. In considering clause 10, we should remember that statistic: one divorce in 25 years.<br><br>
Judges have almost invariably come down on the side of the party who wants a divorce. The "grave" threshold has been so high as to be practically impossible to reach. Judges have also maintained that the hardship bar must result from the divorce process itself, not from the breakdown of the marriage.<br><br>
Any fair reading of the debates in the House of Lords will show that the noble Lords wanted to strengthen the hardship bar. They wanted it to be a real bar and not just entirely cosmetic.<br><br>
There was also concern that the bar should be extended to include children. The Government proposed amendments that now form clause 10. Subsection (2)(a) will bar a divorce in cases where there is
<br><blockquote><p>"substantial financial or other hardship to the party … or to a child of the family".</p></blockquote>
What we must ask ourselves is: despite the concession made by the Government in the other place, will the new wording fare any better than the old wording, which prevented only one divorce in 25 years, bearing in mind the fact that the bar will be defined by the courts? I contend that it is highly unlikely that the new wording will make any difference in practice. As I said, there was a widespread view in the other place that the new wording would prove as cosmetic as the old.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we should examine the context of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. We have heard that the bar prevented one divorce in 25 years, but how many times was it pleaded in the past 25 years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I do not have that information, but I shall try to find it out, and, if there is an opportunity later, I shall give it to the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps the Minister, with the help of his advisers, could tell us, as it would be interesting to know. My understanding is that people have tried to plead hardship, but because the threshold is so high they have been unsuccessful.<br><br>
That is the history of the hardship bar, and I turn now to the amendments that I have tabled, which would substantially improve the bar. I am concerned with cases such as that of a dedicated mother, whose husband decides to leave her. She has only 18 months in which to tidy up all her affairs—what to do with the home, the children and so on.<br><br>
There may be a case for a temporary bar on the divorce. As I shall make clear later, I am not saying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
that we can prevent people from getting divorced—if people want to get divorced, they will. However, I am thinking of cases in which there is grave hardship, especially those in which the marriage has been long standing. I am also thinking of cases in which a child is involved—the child may be at a difficult period, such has having a severe illness or being in the middle of taking important exams. The judge may believe that, for such reasons, there should be a temporary bar on the divorce, perhaps only for a few months.<br><br>
In the other place, Lord Mishcon said that the hardship bar could promote reconciliation by the mere possibility of its use, although some may disagree with that point.<br><br>
In seeking inspiration for the amendments, I went to the source of the Bill—namely, the Lord Chancellor. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a strong feeling in some people's minds that the Law Commission did not recognise sufficiently clearly the need to strengthen the institution of marriage".</p></blockquote>
He suggested a solution to the problem and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would mean working on the hardship provision possibly to give the Court power, if one side was completely innocent and didn't want a divorce, not to have it."</p></blockquote>
I base my remarks on what the Lord Chancellor said. I hope the Minister will respond positively to them as the Lord Chancellor has clearly shown a way forward.<br><br>
Amendment No. 77 would permit a court to bar a divorce if it were satisfied—this is the important point—that granting a divorce would be
<br><blockquote><p>"unjust to the other party"—</p></blockquote>
who did not want a divorce, or if it would be
<br><blockquote><p>"contrary to the interests of any child of the family."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 84 would draw the attention of the court to the conduct of the parties. It would also direct the court to consider
<br><blockquote><p>"the health and well-being of the parties and any relevant children … any financial detriment that may be suffered by either party as a result of the divorce … the social, cultural and ethnic background of the parties and their religious beliefs if any".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 78 would put the burden of proof that the divorce
<br><blockquote><p>"will not adversely affect the interests of"</p></blockquote>
the children on the party seeking the divorce.<br><br>
The present wording of the Bill could lead to the hardship bar, on which so many hopes are pinned, being a mere dead letter. An argument that could be used against me—and which was, indeed, used in 1969—was that if we improved the hardship bar it would be used in a great number of cases. That argument is not true as the hardship bar has hardly ever been used.<br><br>
Another argument is that if we beefed up the hardship bar, it would put up the legal aid bill. Again, that argument has proved groundless given that the hardship bar has hardly ever been used—and only once successfully. Furthermore, the cost of divorce is £5 billion a year. I am talking about a temporary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
measure, although a permanent bar is a theoretical possibility if the court is satisfied that the hardship grounds are proved. It is, however, unlikely that a court would impose a permanent bar.<br><br>
I refer to an anomaly that was drawn to my attention by an experienced divorce lawyer. It is possible for spouse A to obtain an order under the hardship bar preventing a divorce on day 1, then for spouse B to apply on day 2 to cancel the order, which the court must grant unless it is satisfied that the hardship bar still applies. It is true that subsection (5) permits the court to impose conditions that must be met before there is an application to cancel the bar on divorce, but surely the balance of the clause is wrong—a point that my hon. Friend the Minister may wish to deal with in his summing up. How can it be right to permit the barring of divorce one day and its unbarring the next?<br><br>
I urge my hon. Friend to consider introducing a delay before there can be an application to cancel an order stopping a divorce. It is a general principle in common law that judgment brings finality to litigation. The party who wins the judgment is generally entitled to rely on it as establishing his rights in law. I am not sure that he or she can do that under the Bill.<br><br>
The other day I moved an amendment that would have made children the paramount consideration for the court. In replying to that debate, my hon. Friend said that my concerns were met in clause 10. My hon. Friend and members of the Committee must consider whether they are satisfied with the protection measures for children under the Bill. Would it provide sufficient protection in the cases to which I have referred, especially those concerning the married woman who has done her duty for 20 to 30 years? On consideration, the Minister may think that there is a case for beefing up the hardship bar.<br><br>
Should there be exceptions to divorce? Should a court be permitted to turn down a divorce application or should there be unfettered divorce on demand? I believe that minor tinkering with the law is not enough. We must reconsider that hardship bar and ensure that it provides worthwhile protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter Sweeney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the batch of amendments. I shall be brief, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) has covered the issues. In my relatively limited experience as a practising matrimonial lawyer, it has often struck me that the hardship ban exists more in theory than reality. Sadly, when we talk of the children's interests being paramount we actually mean that we take their interests into account. Sometimes we do that when a petitioner has already decided that he or she will obtain the divorce come hell or high water.<br><br>
All too often, matrimonial lawyers are faced with a certificate being granted by the court to the effect that the arrangements for the children are satisfactory or the best that can be devised in the circumstances. We all know that, in reality, the arrangements for the children are less than ideal. The parties and the court
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
have scrabbled around to achieve some sort of arrangement for the children which just about bears scrutiny. The amendments, by placing increased emphasis on hardship as a bar and on the interests of the children of the family, will strengthen the law considerably and be a substantial improvement on present legislation. It is important that we do not merely pay lip service to the interests of children. We must ensure that people are not allowed to obtain a divorce in circumstances blatantly contrary to their children's interests.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we have heard, the clause empowers the court to order that a marriage is not to be dissolved on the application of one party to the marriage, where the other has applied for a divorce order. The clause stipulates that an order preventing divorce may be made only if the court is satisfied that substantial financial or other hardship would be caused to the party making application for an order preventing the divorce, or to a child of the family, or that it would be wrong in all the circumstances—including those of the conduct of the parties and the interests of any child of the family—to dissolve the marriage.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle rightly took us back to the background to the provision in the old law. He said that as there have been few reported cases where the hardship bar has been found to justify making an order preventing divorce means, in itself, that that provision has little or no effect. First, my hon. Friend must recognise that, presumably, it has application only in the 6 per cent. of cases in which, in any event, there is divorce on the ground of five years' separation. Secondly, there may be a variety of cases in which, after five years' separation, the parties may merely be giving effect to a life apart that they have lived for many years anyway. Therefore, many of those people would not be directing attention to the question of whether the courts had power to seek an order preventing divorce in any event. Thirdly, as regards numbers, practitioners apparently say that the presence of the hardship bar is at least a factor that can be used in the financial negotiations between the parties.<br><br>
It may be that there are few reported cases among the 6 per cent. where a court found that an order preventing divorce should be made, although the fact that that capacity existed may have been used by the parties' lawyers in eventually negotiating a settlement. Therefore it is wrong to say that the provision is a dead letter.<br><br>
What is correct is that the Government, in proposing that there now be one ground for divorce—namely, the filing of a statement of marital breakdown and the expiring of a minimum period for reflection and consideration—have had to consider what would happen to the mechanism for applying for an order preventing divorce. If it currently applies to 6 per cent. of cases, should it in future apply to no cases or to all cases? My noble Friend the Lord Chancellor has decided that it should apply to all divorce cases.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said, my noble Friend was willing to respond to concerns about whether the adjective "grave" raised an especially high barrier. I must make it clear that the basis of the application to the court for an order preventing divorce is not the fact of the marital breakdown, but the legal dissolution of the marriage. The court could consider such an order if it believed that that event would cause substantial financial or other hardship to either of the parties or to the children.<br><br>
That change, which my noble Friend introduced in the other place, means that the clause will apply to several new circumstances. In future, not only will it apply to cases in which the parties have been living apart for five years, it will apply to cases in which the parties are still living together. Therefore, orders preventing divorce could apply to a greater variety of circumstances than that suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. The upshot of that is that my hon. Friend is taking an unnecessarily pessimistic view of what the power of the provision might be.<br><br>
I cannot commend my hon. Friend's amendments to the Committee. They would broaden the circumstances in which applications could be made to the court well beyond the circumstances to which I have referred. In essence, many people might seek to have their day in court to air their own grievances against the other party. Surely, my hon. Friend would not want that to happen.<br><br>
My hon. Friend focused his remarks on the circumstances in which the clause will apply. It is right to highlight the difference between "grave" and "substantial"; there is a difference in legal terminology. If substantial hardship were attributable to the dissolution of the marriage and affected either party or a child of the family, the court could direct its attention to such matters. Therefore, the Bill, as drafted, should commend itself to the Committee.<br><br>
The latter point raised by my hon. Friend was especially interesting. It is my understanding that an application for the cancellation of an order to prevent divorce should be made on the basis referred to in subsection (3). I do not envisage that a court would deal sympathetically with an application made the next day to discharge an order made the previous day to prevent a divorce. I should like to consider that matter further. I am not sure to what extent it is a real problem, but I do not dismiss my hon. Friend's concerns.<br><br>
Although I understand the basis of the concerns to which my hon. Friend referred in general, I think that he has paid insufficient attention to the wide application that an order preventing divorce will have under the Bill. I hope that what I have said will persuade him to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, my hon. Friend the Minister's view has moved forward. Although the hardship bar now operates in only 6 per cent. of cases, where the parties have lived apart for five years, he feels that in future it will operate in many more cases.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
Can he say whether the Lord Chancellor's Department has done any research into how often it might be used? I realise that he may not be able to answer that question, but he has also not yet said in what sort of cases it will be used. What sort of practical example does he envisage? I gave a couple of examples—for instance, a long-standing marriage with a complicated domestic situation, where the woman was having to clear up her affairs against her will within 18 months.<br><br>
If the Government have beefed up the hardship bar the Minister should be able to give some practical examples of when it might be used—otherwise, we are arguing in the air. It will be difficult to know what the Bill might achieve. My hon. Friend said that it would result in people airing their grievances. The amendment surely would not be used by couples to argue, "He would not put the top back on the toothpaste tube"; it would be used for more serious grievances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to come between my hon. Friends. Surely the issue is whether people should be free to remarry. The law cannot stop people living apart; it cannot stop couples not getting on together. It merely stops people remarrying. The only reason for divorce is lawfully to free people to be remarried. I cannot quite see how the amendment applies in that sense, which is the only serious consequence of divorce—apart from making arrangements for the children, finances and where people live.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, but he misunderstands the effects of the Bill. For instance, my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and I are worried that the Bill provides that orders agreed to during the process of reflection will not be implemented until after the 18 months have passed. I return to the example of the lady being divorced against her will after a longstanding marriage. Orders may be agreed during the 18 months, to be implemented after that time. That may have a practical consequence. A judge may rule that hardship exists and that the divorce should be temporarily delayed—obviously it cannot be stopped. My hon. Friend is right to say that couples may have been living apart, but I believe that the harship bar could still apply in some cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not worked in a law firm, but I know of a woman who was told that her marriage had been annulled without her knowledge. She did not even know of the application for annulment. That may be unusual, but it shows that marriages can end in different ways, with none of the protections that we are trying to build in now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to debate annulment. My hon. Friend may be better versed in it than I am. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, too, may be better versed in annulment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
I have asked some practical questions and I should be grateful for some reassurance from my hon. Friend the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should direct our attention to the provisions of subsection (2). The circumstances outlined by my hon. Friend could certainly be taken into account by the court in deciding whether an order preventing divorce should be made. The court would be considering whether the dissolution of the marriage would result in
<br><blockquote><p>"substantial financial or other hardship to the other party or to a child of the family; and … that it would be wrong, in all the circumstances … for the marriage to be dissolved."</p></blockquote>
I do not want to restrict the discretion of the courts in considering such matters by listing particular circumstances that the courts should consider.<br><br>
We are directing our attention to orders preventing divorce because my hon. Friend believes that some people would not get protection from clause 10, whereas my argument is that the clause goes significantly wider than the current hardship bar and deals with most of the circumstances involving real hardship attributable to the dissolution of the marriage.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The amendments deal with a far wider set of circumstances in which granting the divorce would be
<br><blockquote><p>"unjust to the other party".</p></blockquote>
That is so wide a definition that we can envisage virtually any set of circumstances in which a party would argue before a court about whether such an injustice had arisen. I believe that my hon. Friend wants to protect the spouse who faces substantial financial or other hardship and for whom the act of divorce in itself brings about that hardship. There is a measure in the Bill that would enable such a person to go to court and seek an order preventing divorce for a period. I urge my hon. Friend to accept that that is a broader power than any in current law and that it addresses many of the concerns that he raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what he has said. We shall have to see what happens. I hope that when we return to the legislation in 25 years' time, that power will have been used in more than a dozen or so cases. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee owes a debt to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and to my hon. Friend the Minister for the way in which they have made their arguments. The underlying issue, which we cannot talk about in discussing amendments, is that when many people get married they establish and declare a religious conviction that the marriage will not end except by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0128">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
death, regardless of whether they continue living together. In current law, and in the Bill, there is an ability to override that against someone's consent.<br><br>
People can change their minds and say that they have made a mistake, but many of us are thrown into confusion at the notion that someone can say that he wants to break a contract that is one of the holiest things to which he has committed himself, against the will of the other party. I was thinking about that at a memorial service at the Brompton Oratory yesterday. In a secular sense, we must accept that that is what we are doing. It causes offence to many people and is one of the reasons why technical amendments have been tabled and discussed. Regardless of whether such amendments are agreed to, that is the underlying context of which people outside the Committee are aware and of which we should be aware. We have, in effect, to say to people that although they have made a commitment we are making it possible for someone else to break it.</span></p>

LORD CHANCELLOR'S RULES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, I want to inquire of the Minister in some detail exactly how the clause will operate and in what context the rules will be made. What discussion has there been in the Lord Chancellor's Department about that process? To give a parallel, I remind the Committee that when we discussed the information meetings we posed several questions to the Minister about how those meetings would take place and we were told that there would be a number of pilot projects.<br><br>
The point made by the Opposition was that information meetings were a new departure in divorce law. Making a statement is also a radical departure—both making the statement and having a period for reflection. We are leaving a great deal to the Lord Chancellor and his Department to decide how the rules will be formulated. The rules will quite clearly include availability of marriage support services, the availability of mediation and whether parties should consider the welfare, wishes and feelings of a child when making arrangements for children. It is also clear that there will be a direction for reconciliation as well as mediation.<br><br>
I want to know the Lord Chancellor's Department's thinking on how the statement will operate. Can the Minister indicate how the rules will operate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 11 enables the Lord Chancellor to make rules relating to the statement of marital breakdown, including the provision of information to the courts about future arrangements. Documents would need to be provided to the court, and information and assistance provided to the parties. The Lord Chancellor may also make rules requiring the legal representative of a party to a marriage in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
whose respect a statement is, or is proposed, to be made to inform parties about the availability of marriage support services, mediation and, in relation to arrangements for children, the need to consider the welfare, wishes and feelings of the child.<br><br>
Similar requirements will be placed on mediators who seek legal aid contracts, including requirements to put arrangements in place to inform parties of the availability of independent legal advice. The rules may also require a legal representative to give parties the names and addresses of people qualified to help to effect a reconciliation, and to certify whether he has complied with requirements and whether he has discussed with the party any matter set out above, and if so which.<br><br>
Clause 11 reflects the importance that the Government place on the parties considering whether their marriage might be saved. If it cannot, they should consider whether mediation might be more appropriate than legal proceedings in resolving disputes.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) for taking us back to last week's debate on information meetings. That debate highlighted some concerns. Some Opposition Members were concerned that the Government intend to engage in wide consultation. It may be helpful if I announce today that the Lord Chancellor has decided to appoint an advisory board to advise on the design, establishment and implementation of pilot schemes relating to the Family Law Bill, to monitor the schemes' progress, to receive and consider a report by a pilot evaluation team that will advise the Lord Chancellor on recommendations, to monitor the operation of the Family Law Act—if it is enacted—and to report to the Lord Chancellor on issues arising from the Act's implementation. Furthermore, the board will advise on the need for, and results of, research into supporting marriage and preventing marriage breakdown. We shall come in due course to provisions that deal with the Lord Chancellor's capacity to make grants for that.<br><br>
The board will be interdisciplinary and will contain representatives of relevant professions and relevant academic disciplines. It will have an independent chairman. The Lord Chancellor will require the board to report to him annually and he will publish an annual report. The Committee will be appointed for an initial period of up to five years, although its terms of reference may need earlier review when the pilot schemes relating to the Family Law Bill are completed. The Lord Chancellor will appoint the body in the late summer so that it will be in place to advise him on the design, establishment and implementation of pilot schemes on information meetings and mediation. I hope that that convers some of the points made by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be interested in what my hon. Friend the Minister has said, and I welcome his remarks. However, it is not clear whether the advisory group or board will have its own budget or whether recommendations will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0129">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
made to the Lord Chancellor's Department or other Departments for funding. I recognise that my hon. Friend cannot answer all our questions in detail today, but perhaps we can expect a wider statement later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the provision in clause 11 to inform parties of marriage support services, mediation and the need to consider the child's welfare, wishes and feelings when making the arrangements. However, the clause states twice that the
<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Chancellor may make rules".</p></blockquote>
I am disturbed that the word "may" rather than "shall" has been used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the Minister's announcement that the Lord Chancellor will establish a board. At the seminar organised by the intergovernmental working group, steered by the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Lord Chancellor was kind enough to agree to consider my suggestion that such a board or advisory committee should be established, and I very much welcome the movement towards that.<br><br>
However, there are a number of questions to be asked. The hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley), who speaks with interest and enthusiasm on these matters, has asked two questions that immediately spring to mind. The advisory board has important work to do. Is it the Government's intention that the board will be established by statute? I should like its terms of reference, composition, powers and role to be clarified and included in the Bill. I recognise that the Minister will introduce a statutory formulation on Report, so that we can debate the board's remit. We want to wish it well and set it on its way to fulfilling an important task, in the knowledge that it has the backing of the whole House.<br><br>
On the matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, it is important to know the content of the draft rules before our final deliberations on the Bill. We urge the Minister to place them either in the Committee Room or in the Library so that we can get a sense of what is proposed in relation to the powers exercised under clause 11.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham and to the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) for welcoming the appointment of the advisory board. I remind the Committee that it is not envisaged that the board will be set up on a statutory basis, and I am certainly prepared to consider any representations that the hon. Member for Brent, South may make; although he will be aware that the Children Act advisory committee—which was set up to monitor the operation of that Act—has operated very successfully, and has been broadly welcomed across the political divide. That body was similarly not set up on a statutory basis, so we are following precedent in our announcement, although I do not want to suggest that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
I shall not give further consideration to different observations on that point.<br><br>
As I made clear in my opening remarks, advising on the need for—and results of—research into supporting marriage and preventing marriage breakdown is part of the board's remit. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham will be aware that, under clause 20—if it is agreed to, although I cannot imagine that it will be disputed—the Lord Chancellor may, with Treasury approval, make grants in connection with
<br><blockquote><p>
<ul>
<li>(a) "the provision of marriage support services:</li>
<li>(b) research into the causes of marital breakdown:</li>
<li>(c) research into ways of preventing marital breakdown."</li></ul></p></blockquote>
In other words, there is a specific statutory authority given to the Lord Chancellor's Department under the Bill to make grant aid available for that research. That dovetails with my announcement on looking to the board for advice on whether research should be undertaken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one is suggesting that the Lord Chancellor would do anything that was outside the law or that he did not have common law or statutory powers to do. The question is whether the board itself would be able to direct research or whether it would advise the Lord Chancellor or other Ministers on the research that should take place.<br><br>
One thing that is not covered under clause 20 is whether the board can ask for or direct research into the way the law works. That is not covered by the specific examples, although I am sure that the fact that it is not mentioned does not mean that it is excluded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the remit of reporting to the Lord Chancellor and advising on issues that arise from the implementation of the Bill is sufficiently broad to cover my hon. Friend's point. As to the Lord Chancellor's power to make grants, he currently gives grants for marriage support services, although there is no specific statutory power to do so. I would not say that the Lord Chancellor is acting ultra vires in doing that, but the Bill will place on the statute book the power for the Lord Chancellor, with the approval of the Treasury, to make such grants. Dialogue with the marriage support services has shown me how much they welcome the fact that that provision is in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a brief point. During the 20 years that I have been a Member of Parliament, the immense disparity between the amount of money spent on divorce and that spent on helping people change their understanding of their lives, so that divorce becomes less common, has been very clear. I hope that, one way or another—it is not for me to say whether the board is the right body for this—we can provide information in a popular way that will make people understand what is associated with making or continuing successful marriages.<br><br>
Although the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys—or whatever the new sister organisation is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0130">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
called—currently issues information in a dry sense, there is not much to help the new cohort of the 700,000 people who are born each year or the 700,000 people who may be considering matrimony at some stage to understand what they can learn from other people's experiences, let alone from their own experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that concerns such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend will be considered by the board, even under the specific terms of reference that I outlined. They are broad terms, so nothing that my hon. Friend has mentioned would not be covered to Some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In common with other hon. Members, I welcome the Minister's announcement about the board. I believe that he said that membership would consist of relevant professions and academics. Can he give a little more detail? In my view, women should be more strongly represented on the board. Equally, I feel that matters should not be left exclusively to the deliberations of professions and/or academics. Will lay members be appointed, or people who deal directly with children in circumstances of marital discord?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The experience of the Lord Chancellor's Department, especially with the advisory committee, has been that it is not beyond us to put together a body of people who command widespread respect to examine these issues. That is our aim. I do not wish at this stage to be drawn down a path of agreeing to the appointment of such a wide range of people that the board immediately becomes unmanageable. I note what the hon. Lady says. She will probably know of the wide respect that the Children Act advisory committee enjoys. We shall certainly attempt to follow similar procedures with membership of this board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also do his best to ensure, if the board is to be responsible for giving grants, that care is taken to ensure that they are not given almost exclusively to board members' departments and universities and so on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Lord Nolan would have something to say about that if it happened.<br><br>
The grant-aiding power is taken by the Lord Chancellor himself, and the board's remit will be to advise him about its operation.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 31 in page 9, line 13, at end insert—

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 32, in clause 13, page 9, line 29, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(c) for the purpose of appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to protect the interest and welfare of any child of the family.".</p></blockquote></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"whose interests and welfare shall be a paramount consideration.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me at once say that the amendment has the support of a wide cross-section of organisations connected with children's welfare. These include the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the National Children's Homes Action for Children, the Children's Society, Barnados, Save the Children Fund and the Children's Rights Development Unit, as well as the national panels of guardians ad litem and reporting officers. I pay tribute to the work done by Judith Timms and her staff in their preparation and advice on the formulation of the amendment.<br><br>
The impact of divorce on children is considerable. Their interests, and concern for them, have been a feature of our debates. This is a practical opportunity to take action to show our anxiety about the fact that the law currently fails adequately to safeguard the interests of children.<br><br>
The Minister, when announcing the appointment of an advisory board, referred to the Children Act advisory committee. The amendment is based on that committee's experience, its annual report for 1992–93 and its conclusions about the operation of the Children Act 1989.<br><br>
The amendment would extend the range of specified proceedings in which a guardian ad litem could be appointed under any section 8 order. It would give the court the power to appoint a panel guardian if the court felt that that was necessary. So the discretion of the court would be maintained. It would be for the court to assess where the best interests of the children lay.<br><br>
In recent research on separate representation of children in private law proceedings, the Children's Society found that the majority of those responding, including the judiciary, to the questionnaire used during the research thought that there was a definite need for separate representation, especially in cases in which there was a conflict of interest between the children and their parents. Such conflicts are not uncommon.<br><br>
The benefit of separate representation would be that the child's views could be put independently, to both the parties and to the court. That would facilitate agreement between the parties, which could have the benefit of shortening the proceedings.<br><br>
Section 37 of the Children Act 1989 creates a bridge between private and public law proceedings.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0131">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
However, it allows for the appointment of a guardian only if the court thinks that it might be appropriate for a care or supervision order to be made with respect to the child. In many cases, a range of concerns need to be addressed, but it might not be necessary to seek a care or supervision order.<br><br>
Under section 37 of the 1989 Act, the court must have directed the appropriate local authority to undertake an investigation into the child's circumstances before the child can have separate representation. Experience has shown that the courts have felt it necessary to appoint guardians in private law proceedings in which there are disputes about residence or contact arrangements for children.<br><br>
Indeed, many judges have tried to appoint guardians in cases in which it was technically inappropriate. As a result, the widely respected—as the Minister said—Children Act advisory committee expressed concern about the breadth and variety of the misuse of section 37. In particular, the committee drew attention to the fact that it had been made aware of circumstances in which the section 37 reporter had revealed serious parental deficiencies, but the local authority had still declined to apply for a care or supervision order, thereby placing the court in considerable difficulty. The amendment is designed to avoid that difficulty; the need for it is clear.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The number of directions made under section 37 in private law rose from 1,205 between January and June 1992 to 1,890 between January and June 1993. The number of children who currently need the protection of section 37 orders has increased. So we can safely assume that the number of children who fall outside section 37 is also on the increase. It is important that the section be brought into effect under the Bill so that the interests of children are preserved.<br><br>
We must not be under any illusion about the scale of the problem. Each year approximately 150,000 children experience the process of divorce. Their parents' marriages are dissolved; the impact of that dissolution is felt all too adversely by the children. Some 25,000 of the 150,000 children who are affected by divorce each year are experiencing the process for the second or even the third time—25,000 children each year! That statistic is truly horrific, and we would be remiss as legislators if we did not act on the advice of those who wrestle with the problem day in, day out and table an amendment along those lines. I am also pleased to give my support to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Merionnydd Nant Conwy. We must not shirk our responsibility.<br><br>
The extent of the problem is clear. It is to be dealt with by mediation and we shall have the opportunity to go into detail about the benefits, strengths and weaknesses of the mediation process. I am sure that members of the Committee have been struck by the movement of the law into an area about which very little is known generally. Even less is known about its impact and suitability for dealing with the needs of children.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
Some important research into the interests of children has been conducted by the centre for family research at the university of Cambridge. In July 1994, M. P. M. Richards presented his paper to the international conference on families and justice in Brussels. It dealt with how best children's views might be determined and how those views could be fed into the mediation process.<br><br>
One of the problems found during that study was that mediation practice varies widely. In most cases, children play no direct part; it is assumed that they will benefit indirectly from whatever agreements their parents may make, and from the attention that the mediation process focuses on their needs.<br><br>
Improving communication between the parents and the children is often one of the stated aims of mediators. That is sometimes done by including children in the final mediation session, during which the decisions reached are reviewed and children have a chance of hearing at first hand what has been decided. It may seem plausible that such a process would help children, but it is rarely done. In some circumstances, it might not be appropriate, because of the pressure that it might put children under; in other circumstances, it could help. It would depend on the degree of agreement and amity that existed between the parents themselves<br><br>
Not only is the attendance of children at mediation sessions rare; it is almost totally unevaluated. One of our difficulties is that we know very little about the consequences of mediation for children. We know little about its suitability as a way of meeting children's interests. The value of court-based decisions in relation to children is that courts have many years' experience of grappling with the need to ensure that children's views are known, recognising also that children do not necessarily have the depth of understanding to be the best judge of what is in their best interests. It is a delicate balance, and we must ensure that the courts are well equipped to arrive at their decisions.<br><br>
With mediation, we are entering uncharted waters. It is important that courts should have available to them, in appropriate cases, independent representation, through the appointment of a panel guardian. It is by no means clear that mediation is in the interests of children. That is why we should take care. We should put aside for a moment the matter of decision making—and that is difficult enough. We must also consider the children's emotions, not least in the setting up of new arrangements for residence, visiting arrangements and improving communication and reducing conflict between their parents. Children need a voice, and an opportunity for representation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the amendments. A great deal has been said about children, who are the core of our considerations. These amendments are the first to deal directly with children's needs.<br><br>
Clause 8 is about children's views being taken into consideration during information meetings. Clause 11 says that legal representations should reflect the views
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0132">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
of children. Clause 24 adds that solicitors given a legal aid franchise should stress the importance of children. Clause I says that when divorce occurs there should be
<br><blockquote><p>"minimum distress to the parties and to the children affected".</p></blockquote>
Those provisions are important and welcome.<br><br>
However, I am anxious that the Bill does not go far enough. It does not introduce a framework strong enough to protect children's interests. The Bill considers arrangements made for children, but those may not be in their interests. It is important that in some cases—a relatively small number—children's views should be directly addressed and that their views should always be considered. It is important for courts to hear children's voices directly.<br><br>
The Bill puts a duty on parents and legal representatives to reflect the views of children, but not to hear the direct voice of children. That is a serious omission.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South talked about the work of children's charities, particularly the NSPCC. I was particularly struck by the NSPCC's children's day publication on 1 May 1996. Children were asked what they would do if they were Prime Minister for a day. Philip, aged 14, from Hemel Hempstead, said that if he were Prime Minister, he would
<br><blockquote><p>"encourage children, and give them a chance to talk to someone. Many children have problems and don't talk about them because they may be scared or embarrassed."</p></blockquote>
Ian, 13, from Etwall, said he would
<br><blockquote><p>"give children more responsibility, and help them cope with it, it would help them to be more responsible people. You always feel you are being discriminated against because you are too young to understand about stuff and not grown up enough."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support what the hon. Gentleman has just said. In Wednesday week, several hundred people will be at Coventry cathedral from all over the country and from all ethnic minorities to give young people the opportunity to say what they feel about growing up in the late 20th century. The difference between the views that they express and the views expressed on their behalf by the older generation is striking.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point, which I am sure is correct. Mark, aged 13, from Hemel Hempstead, would agree. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Give children more rights, they can be more like adults in what they do but not excessively. Make politicians and others in authority listen more to children's ideas. Adults treat children sometimes like they are inferior, they can give their ideas freely as they are our future."</p></blockquote>
What I am saying is that we should not be afraid of hearing children's views. The comments that I have just quoted reflect the maturity of young people.<br><br>
We should give children, in certain circumstances, independent rights and independent representation before courts. It is clear that many children whose parents get divorced go through a time of turmoil and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
tension. In many cases, they are unwilling or unable to express their view, because of the situation in the family. They cannot talk, perhaps because they are frightened of damaging their relationship with parents who are in dispute. I have also had experience of cases in which children express different views depending on which parent they are talking to. It is important to give children a chance to speak for themselves and to ensure that their views are heard before the courts.<br><br>
It is important not only to reflect children's maturity but to acknowledge that they may have a different concept of time. The period of consideration and reflection has been extended during consideration of the Bill, and now stands at 21 months. That can be a long time in a child's mind. For a child of 21 months it is another whole lifetime. For children of three, who can begin to understand the situation, 21 months is more than half their lifetime.<br><br>
Time is important to children, and I want to give the Committee an illustration of that. Several years ago I was working with a girl whose mother had terminal cancer. Every day, she would ask whether her mother would die that day, and the response, "No, not today" was satisfactory to her; she could cope with the span of a day, but 21 months would have been another lifetime and a completely different experience for her. I fear that we have lost sight of children's needs during our consideration of the Bill. That is why we need to listen directly to children's views.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South spelt out the current legal position. I am a great supporter of the Children Act 1989, but it presents difficulties about listening to children's views, which can be considered only if a guardian ad litem is appointed and that appointment can be made only in a very limited number of cases in which the child is at risk and a supervision order or care order is envisaged. I want to extend that right. I believe that it exists in Scotland and I want to extend it, by means of the Bill, to children in this country.<br><br>
We should give the judge the power to appoint a guardian, especially in section 8 cases involving residence and disputed custody, to ensure that the children's views are heard directly by the court. Frequently, children's views are inadequately reflected by the parents or their legal advisers. It is essential to give children that right.<br><br>
We should acknowledge not only the children's charities to which my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South referred, but the work of the family court welfare service, which is extremely important. I am surprised that it is not mentioned in the Bill. I am told that people connected with the probation service wanted to discuss the Bill with the Lord Chancellor's Department, but as yet have not had the opportunity to do so. It is important to have professionals and people with skills who can listen to children and pass their views directly to the courts. It is also important for someone to examine the behaviour of younger children and to explain what certain behaviour means. The family court welfare service has such skills.<br><br>
We have discussed parenting, especially the role of fathers and the different relationships involving step-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0133">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
parents, new partners, natural parents and so on, but we have not talked about the quality of the relationship between a child and his father. Again, the family court welfare service could play an important role.<br><br>
I welcome amendment No. 33 because it stresses that children's
<br><blockquote><p>"interests and welfare shall be a paramount consideration."</p></blockquote>
That is a key phrase in the Children Act 1989, which could be reflected in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to be careful about the practicalities. If someone decides that it is of paramount importance to the children for the parents to stay together, is there any way that that can be enforced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not be of paramount importance to do what the child wants, but the phrase "paramount consideration" is slightly different. A judgment of the paramount interests of the child must be made. For some children, it is clearly best for them if the family stays together, but there are a great many cases when that will not be the best option. There is evidence showing that it is often in the child's interests for the parents to separate. We must consider what good parenting is and I hope that the new advisory committee will examine that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has recognised the difference between the child's interests and his wishes being paramount. There has been far too much confusion in professional circles since we passed the Children Act 1989, inasmuch as people seem to think that the child's wishes should be paramount, which is blatantly mad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is always a danger in speaking from our own experience. I know from my experience, as other hon. Members may, that a child's wishes are often not in his or her best interests. A wish list is not a good thing, which is why I stress the importance of parenting.<br><br>
I strongly support the amendments. I noticed that during the Committee stage of the Children Act in another place, on 19 January 1989, the Lord Chancellor gave an assurance that the whole issue of a children's welfare service would be reviewed. I believe that now is the time for that. I have spoken at length about hearing children's views. Let the final word go to Ross, aged 13, from Great Yarmouth, who says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If I were Prime Minister on NSPCC Children's day I would take a children's committee to put their view forward like a children's parliament. Because children don't get a say on anything. adults are mucking up the planet."</p></blockquote>
I have a real worry that the Bill is being mucked up by adults and that children's interests are being put at risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that none of the children advised the Prime Minister that he should resign.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
Although I speak in support of my amendments Nos. 32 and 33, I also support amendment No. 31, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Brent, South and his colleagues. It is evident that they were tabled at the same time because one of my amendments to some extent emulates the proposals in his amendment. If the hon. Gentleman seeks to divide the Committee, I shall have no hesitation in agreeing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gary Streeter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not always.<br><br>
No doubt there will be references to mediation and the need for mediators to be fully trained. Fortunately, there are many panel solicitors who are able, qualified and ready to act as guardians. The Law Society has empanelled many who specialise in child law, so that resource is readily available.<br><br>
It is important to remember that in mediation the objective is agreement. Some people have said that appointing a representative for children at the mediation stage is somewhat revolutionary. So what? If issues are to be agreed early, children should be brought in at an early stage. I find nothing wrong with that. If it breaks new ground, so be it. I pay tribute to the various organsiations that have helped to highlight the need for amendments. I think especially of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, of which I am proud to be a Welsh council member, as is the Minister.<br><br>
The amendments would give the courts the power to make orders for separate representation in the exceptional cases where that is necessary in a child's interests. I do not foresee an opening of floodgates. Clearly, it will not happen all the time. They are a small minority of cases, but small minority or not, it is important that we cater for them.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
I also believe, as does the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, that the provision for separate representation is definitely necessary if the principle of clause 1(c)(i) is to be upheld. That provides that marriages should be brought to an end
<br><blockquote><p>"with minimum distress to the parties and to the children affected".</p></blockquote>
The amendments would allow the court to discharge the responsibility that the Bill lays on it and to consider the welfare of the children involved at each point in the divorce process.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brent, South has referred to section 37 of the Children Act 1989, so I shall not detain the Committee by retreading that ground. Suffice it to say that the amendments would extend the provision for guardians into private law—I think that is a fair summary of the intention. It is important that that change be made, for numerous reasons. In many cases, children will need that independence of representation despite there being no question of care proceedings being brought or any investigation being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
conducted by the local authority. It is only right and proper that we cater for those cases. The hon. Member for Brent, South also mentioned recent research suggesting that separate representation is accepted and wholeheartedly supported by the judiciary and by all people involved in that fraught and difficult field of law.<br><br>
The amendments are necessary to resolve the possibility of a conflict of interest between either parent and any child of the marriage. The courts would have an opportunity to ensure that an independent voice was heard. As the hon. Member for Sherwood said earlier, children might well feel inhibited from speaking their minds because of the influence—whether latent or otherwise—of either parent. Independent representation is vital in such cases. The guardians ad litem would safeguard the children's interests and ensure that they were heard and the courts would be afforded the opportunity to bring in an independent view of the child's situation. One hopes that that would facilitate an agreement and possibly divert proceedings away from court.<br><br>
I submit that the amendments would provide a safety net for the relatively small but nevertheless vulnerable group of children who need it. It is anticipated that the power would apply primarily to contested section 8 applications for residency contact orders, but it would, of course, go further than that.<br><br>
The amendments would form a logical extension of the philosophy and principles that were laid down in the Children Act 1989. I add my voice readily and freely to those who have spoken in favour of that Act. It was a welcome piece of legislation which has revolutionised the way in which children's cases are dealt with. So as not to be churlish, I also welcome the Minister's statement that a board will be set up. I know from my experience of the board that is working on the Children Act 1989 that that will be a beneficial innovation and that we can look forward to positive results.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sherwood referred to assurances given by the Lord Chancellor in 1989. Now is the time for those assurances to be acted on and the Bill is surely the vehicle for a review of the whole subject of children's welfare. If we miss this opportunity, I do not know when we will be able to revisit these important matters.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sherwood and I have made it clear that the Lord Chancellor was unambiguous about the fact that there would be a review of arrangements for the independent representation of children in all family proceedings. That undertaking was given in 1989—we are debating this Family Law Bill in 1996 and it is the perfect opportunity to fulfil that pledge.<br><br>
The Solicitors Family Law Association has said that the ability to appoint a guardian ad litem in private law disputes, as proposed in the amendments, is a valuable option that current legislation renders practically impossible to implement. The definite and strong consensus in favour of separate representation for children has been referred to before. The amendments have not been tabled just for the sake of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
it, but the Bill's silence on the matter is a great flaw. I repeat that the Bill is primarily about the family, not divorce.<br><br>
There is ample evidence that there are more and more children, especially teenagers, who need independent representation, but for whom it is not appropriate to pursue the possibility of a care or supervision order. Many children need help in protecting their financial, educational and emotional interests. The amendments offer a golden opportunity to put in place a vehicle for those aspirations and for the protection of those children's rights and privileges.<br><br>
Finally, I shall deal with amendment No. 33. For the past 20 years or so, all legislation has acknowledged the important assumption that the interests of children are paramount. That has been one of the mainstays of child law and was—rightly—in evidence throughout the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Amendment No. 33 would put that notion into the Bill.<br><br>
I am sure that all hon. Members are united in the view that children should suffer as little trauma as possible when a marriage breaks down. We would all strive as hard as possible to ensure that that is so. Yet while it is vital that we recognise that the welfare and interests of children are paramount, I do not agree that we should accept every opinion expressed by a child—who, after all, is immature. Nor is it always true that a child will opt for what is in his or her best long-term interests. However, the welfare of children has to be the mainspring of this part of the Bill. It cannot be treated as subordinate to the interests of the other parties. We must ensure that the child's interests are paramount.<br><br>
I can see no good reason for not accepting amendment No. 33. It would give reassurances and alert the relevant authorities of the need to pay due attention and regard to children's needs and interests. I sincerely hope that the Committee can unite and ensure that the amendment is included in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not speak for long as many of the points that I intended to make have been made. I add simply that, given that there is now a prolonged period before the divorce will be finally completed, the amendments are even more crucial. The uncertainty for children and the guilt involved in determining what is in their best interests are enormous problems. The amendments provide a power, not a duty, that will be used in circumstances where it is absolutely essential. As other hon. Members said, the power will ensure that children's voices are heard. Parents do not always know best and we must recognise that there are occasions when absurd arrangements, inappropriate for their best interests, are made on children's behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendments. I must make it clear that I do not disagree with the principle of much that has been said in the debate. It is important that children's voices be heard in proceedings regarding their future, but the Bill, taken together with the provisions of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
Children Act 1989, renders the amendments unnecessary. Indeed, my concern and, I am bound to say, my fear is that the amendments could lead to increased pressure on children to take sides between their parents during the divorce process. I fear that the amendments could exacerbate hostility between the parties. I am also concerned to ensure that we do not duplicate services that already exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assist the Committee by sharing with us the source of his fear? It is clearly not shared by the NSPCC, NCH Action for Children, the Children's Society, Barnardo's, Save the Children Fund, the Children's Rights Development Unit or the national panels of guardians ad litem and reporting officers. If those bodies cannot tell us what is likely to cause a burden on children, who can? What is the source from which the Minister derives his superior insights into the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should proceed with caution if we believe that because a group of children's charities promote a specific concept, there is no alternative argument. If the hon. Gentleman can contain himself a little, I hope to develop my concerns as I did when I met with Mr. Philip Noyes, the director of communications for the NSPCC, last Wednesday, when I outlined my exact worries in relation to the amendments. Let it not be said that merely because a specific proposition is made by a children's charity, ther is no alternative argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to something he said a couple of minutes ago about the amendments being superfluous? During the break before this afternoon's sitting, could he please find out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
exactly what statutory provision there is for guardians ad litem to be brought into private proceedings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to outline how we might be presented with a difficulty by duplicating services already in existence. I have been prevented so far from doing so because I have given way to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and others.<br><br>
It will be helpful to outline to the Committee the existing mechanisms for ensuring that the voice of a child is heard under existing law. As many hon. Members said, the Children Act itself makes children's welfare the paramount consideration in any question concerning their upbringing. That consideration also applies to any applications which are made under the 1989 Act within divorce and separation proceedings. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy reminded us of provisions in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, but he will find that those are replicated in that applications made under divorce and separation proceedings under the Children Act contain the very paramountcy test which he argues should be introduced through the amendments. That is one subject on which there is some duplication.<br><br>
The court already has the power under section 7(1) of the Children Act 1989 to order the production of a welfare report. To produce such a report will often involve talking to the children about their wishes and feelings. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has made several representations to me about the effectiveness of that process. His worries relate specifically to how—</span></p>
