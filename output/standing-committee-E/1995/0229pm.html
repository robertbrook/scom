	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned, the Economic Secretary was asked what briefing had been given to Conservative Back Benchers. She was asked when and where it had taken place, who had attended, how long it had lasted, what other parts of the Bill they had been briefed on, why it had happened and why such facilities had been offered by civil servants to Back Benchers. She replied that an offer had been made to those Conservative Back Benchers who had requested it. I was not sure when the briefing had occurred, whether it had covered other parts of the Bill or how many Back Benchers had been involved. I understand that some Conservative Back Benchers were given a briefing this morning and that others may have had briefings on other occasions. Will the Economic Secretary tell us exactly what had happened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I answered all those questions before 1 o'clock. I told the hon. Gentleman that a briefing took place this morning, lasting approximately three quarters of an hour, for those Back Benchers who had requested it. That took place after the Front Bench briefing. Those on the Opposition Front Bench have a second briefing on Monday. I was asked and I saw no harm in agreeing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that I am the only member of the Committee to have tabled amendments on the clauses and schedules that we are about to consider. The Government amendments may deal with some of the points raised in my amendments. I should like clarification on the grouping of amendments and when certain amendments will be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 205 to 212 are contained in a grouping under clause 76 on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>610</span>
provisional selection list. Government amendments Nos. 206 to 212 relate to schedule 8. We are also due to consider Government amendments Nos. 214 and 215 in the same grouping. I believe that those amendments relate to clause 77. Will all those amendments, relating to various clauses and schedules, be debated under clause 76?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in order to do that and it is appropriate in the context of the subject matter. If it does not cause the hon. Gentleman any difficulties, it would be best if he made his contribution at that time. His amendments have also been selected, so there should be no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a slightly different point to raise. I have talked to the Clerk about my concern that several of the amendments which have been grouped seem to bear little or no relation to each other. I understand that the groupings were drawn up on the advice of the Government draftsmen, who believed that the amendments were related. Government amendments Nos. 244 and 245 relate to each other, but they bear no apparent relation to Government amendment No. 234. The amendments grouped with Government amendment No. 204 are scattered all over the various clauses and schedules in an almost higgledy-piggledy manner. I had intended to ask the Minister, when we reached those amendments, why her draftsmen had recommended that grouping. It does not seem to be the best way for the Committee properly to consider the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be appropriate to ask the Minister to comment on that because responsibility for the grouping of amendments lies with the Chair, but I note what the hon. Gentleman said. I cannot add anything to what I said previously. We do our best to group amendments in a way that makes sense in the context of debating the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear with me. I am sure that he will be able to put his case without the group of amendments being divided, which I am reluctant to do because I believe that the present groupings make the best sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>MEANING OF "LOAN RELATIONSHIP" ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several issues arise from the clause. I shall deal first with a point made by the Law Society. Various Conservative Members have declared an interest, so I must state that I am a member of the Law Society—at least I pay money to it, although I am unsure what I get out of it. In its submission on clause 73, the Law Society says:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>611</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We find this a very difficult clause to interpret. This is a matter of concern, because it is the foundation of the new regime and the advent of self-assessment makes it particularly important that companies should be able to determine conclusively which of the money debts with which they are concerned give rise to loan relationships."</p></blockquote>
I find the clause difficult to interpret. The clause is meant to clarify and avoid doubt but my concern is that it creates doubt. Indeed, the Chartered Institute of Taxation was so concerned about it that it recommended its deletion to avoid confusion. That is not good basis on which to proceed. It seems to me—our briefing yesterday with civil servants touched on this—that clause 73 is modified to some extent by clause 92. Will the Minister clarify whether that is true because there does not appear to be any cross-referencing? I believe that there is a need to cross-reference but it might be possible to accommodate that simply by inserting after the first line of the clause "and section 92". However, I understand that that might not be necessary, so I hope that the Minister will clarify the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 73(3) is especially difficult to interpret. It applies,
	<br><blockquote><p>"where an instrument is issued by any person for the purpose of representing security for …"</p></blockquote>
What is an instrument? I understand that the Stamp Act 1891 suggests that an instrument is any document. Furthermore, what does "issued" mean? Would a letter confirming a trade debt come within the legislation? Would a promissory note or an IOU count? Would an instrument representing security be one created by novation of an existing loan, or, as the Institute of Chartered Accountants asks, would it be a debt created in relation to the vesting of assets on privatisation? In particular, the use of the word "security" raises the question of whether this is intended to introduce the familiar concept of the debt on a security, or the much wider meaning of the phrase which has been favoured by the Revenue in the context of the phrase "deep gain security", or some new shade of meaning altogether. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is suggesting that there is a lack of clarity. On the grounds that ambiguity exists, and in the light of Pepper v. Hart, the Minister should clarify that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say that the objective is clarity, but, as I have pointed out, various organisations doubt that. In its submission, the Law Society states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new regime is presumably intended to apply to loan notes issued on a takeover on the basis that the notes are instruments issued by the acquiring company for the purpose of representing the rights of the loan note holder. But what is the intended position if certificates are not issued? There will have been no lending of money, merely unpaid purchase money remaining outstanding. Although the holders' names are entered in the register of loan note holders, is the register thought to be an 'instrument issued' by the acquiring company? Even if certificates are issued, they will only be prima facie evidence of the loan note holders' entitlements, and it is arguable that they do not 'represent' anything."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will provide some clarification on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also unclear whether "debt" includes a contingency debt. There is a body of case law in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>612</span>
respect of contingency debt that seems to suggest that it is included under the general term, "debt". Is that so? In the light of Pepper v. Hart, it might be useful to clarify that ambiguity. Does that affect in any way payments by guarantors under guarantees? Will the Minister clarify that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A note from the Law Society asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is it intended that a debt will be taken to arise from a transaction for the lending of money if the debtor is not a 'borrower' only if he issues some kind of instrument which 'represents' the debt, such as a bill of exchange or a promissory note?"</p></blockquote>
Under 73(3) reference is made to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a transaction for the lending of money".</p></blockquote>
That phrase means a loan, does it not? The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) fights for the cause of simplicity—for which quest he will, no doubt, go down in parliamentary history. Should we not pay heed to the need for simplicity? If "loan" is what we mean, we should use the word, "loan". Is there some reason why we should not? As far as I am aware, the lengthy phrase used is not one of art or of law, and it adds nothing to the precision of the Bill. Perhaps some alteration would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further issue is what "money" means in this context. Few transactions involve coins or notes, so what is included in the definition of money? Again, Pepper v. Hart means that the Minister should use this opportunity to offer clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has given us some draft comments on amendments. The institute says in respect of clause 73(3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Probably the most important issue still outstanding is the uncertainty in the definition of 'loan relationships' … Nothing has yet been done to clarify whether ordinary commercial documentation, such as contracts and invoices, would amount to `an instrument … representing security' for the purposes of clause 73(3). We understand that such documentation is not in fact intended to be included, and that the Inland Revenue regard the phrase in question as broadly equivalent to 'a security' as defined in section 132(3)(b) TCGA 1992. That being so, we recommend that the latter definition should be expressly applied for the purposes of clause 73, so that the existing body of case law dealing with the phrase 'a debt on a security' can be used as an aid to interpretation."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister deal with that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 73(5) deserves to be quoted in its entirety, before the hon. Member for Beaconsfield turns his attention to it, because it is amazing. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Chapter—
	<ol>
	<li>references to payments or interest under a loan relationship are references to payments or interest made or payable in pursuance of any of the rights or liabilities under that relationship; and</li>
	<li>references to rights or liabilities under a loan relationship are references to any of the rights or liabilities under the agreement or arrangements by virtue of which relationship subsists;</li></ol>
and those rights or liabilities shall be taken to include the rights or liabilities attached to any security which, being a security issued in relation to the money debt in question, is a security representing that relationship."</p></blockquote>
Surely there must be a simpler way of putting that? In view of the resolution of the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>613</span>
Beaconsfield last year, can we not simplify it? If not, why not? What does it say about rights and liabilities that have to be dealt with in such a prolix way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that subsection means is that a payment is a payment that is either made or payable, and interest is either interest that is made or payable. It is just a tortuous way of saying it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. No lessons seem to have been learnt since last year when the hon. Gentleman—whom we supported—made his views clear. We have an opportunity to make changes. Legislation is complex enough. We do not need to make it more complex. Why do we not simplify it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not simplified but complicated the matter. I am aware that nit-pickers and hair-splitters have been raising some of those points, but they and the Committee need to consider the basic issue. We have taken full legal advice. I assure the hon. Gentleman that if we focus more narrowly and go through list after list, someone will find a way around the clauses that simplify corporate debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two essential ingredients in a loan relationship. First, is there a debt? Secondly, did it arise from lending money? If someone is paying interest on a debt, there is a loan relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to address some of the hon. Gentleman's points. Clause 73 is not modified by clause 92 because clause 73 deals with loans for money whereas clause 92 deals with interest on things which are not loans for money. That same definition is used when considering the general list of every conceivable type of certificate, including those named by the hon. Gentleman. It does not extend to invoices or payments under guarantees, but it does extend to tradeable loan notes, for example when taken in exchange for a takeover bid. Whether promissory notes are covered by the new rules depends on whether there is a loan of money. If there is, the promissory note is covered; if there is not, then it is not. The answer to the question about certification is the same. Again, on contingency debt, one uses the same criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a contingency debt, how can one look at the same criteria? If there is a contingency, there is a contingency as to whether it arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the terms of the debt. If there is no certainty that any amount will be payable, then the answer is no.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue raised by the hon. Gentleman and others is not that the definition of loan relationship is uncertain, but that it is unfamiliar. Because it is an unfamiliar term, people are not used to working with it. But like any unfamiliar term, as soon as one gets used to the idea of what the term is, it becomes as familiar as the old expression. If I may pray in aid the first time that I served on a Committee when I came to the House of Commons, other new Members and I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>614</span>
were amazed when the Chairman asked the Committee after half an hour or so to vote on something called "clause stand part". None of us knew what he was talking about. In the afternoon, a new Chairman came along and in his beautifully modulated tones, Mr. Hogg—he was a Labour Chairman—he informed us that we once again had to vote on "clause stand part". After another half an hour, during which we scratched our heads, we suddenly realised that we were voting that the clause stand part of the Bill. Now the phrase "clause stand part" is as familiar as any other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of loan relationships. The phrase may be unfamiliar at present, but it will soon be as familiar in accounting and financial circles as clause stand part debates are to those of us who serve on Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I again seek clarification on various matters. I have had discussions with the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which expressed various anxieties about the clause. It thinks that the separate treatment of trading and non-trading items will cause some difficulty in relation to money that has been borrowed for the general purposes of a Company that is engaged in trading and other activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am sorry to interrupt the Committee's proceedings, but I cannot hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am having difficulty hearing the hon. Gentleman. It would help is he would raise his voice a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to speak more loudly and slowly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions may arise about the correct classification of interest—for example, when a trading company borrows to pay a dividend, to acquire its original trade, to acquire an additional trade, to acquire a subsidiary or to acquire a new trading subsidiary whose trade it immediately divides up. In each of those cases, will the Minister clear up the ambiguities, again on the basis of Pepper and Hart?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other representations by the Institute of Chartered Accountants relate to the legislation being framed throughout by reference to accounting periods, with no recognition of the possibility that accounts could be for a longer period. I am aware that clauses that we shall discuss later attempt to deal with that problem.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>615</span>
However, the institute feels that that problem has not been dealt with sufficiently. It says that the logic of an accounts-based system would be to accommodate debits and credits for the period of an account and then time-apportion under secion 72 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 where necessary. However, it is not clear that the Bill will have that effect, or that it is intended to have that effect. Will the Minister clarify the situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rules give relief for trade-related interest expense as a deduction in computing trading profits, in place of the existing treatment as a charge on income. The Institute of Chartered Accountants says that that is disadvantageous in two respects to United Kingdom companies trading overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how to deal with matters that were raised during briefings, but when I raised the question of disadvantages in a briefing, it was suggested to me that the institute's suggestion was not the case. I have talked today, through advisers, to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which insists that it is the case that the clause will bring two disadvantages. First, it says that a company whose overseas trade is taxed under case V of schedule D will no longer be entitled to surrender as group relief any associated interest costs that exceed case V profit before interest. The excess will only be available to carry forward as a case V loss. It says that that problem could be resolved simply by extending group relief to cover case V losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it says that whether the trade is taxed under case I or case V, the interest debit will reduce the foreign-source profit and so is likely to restrict the availability of double tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent it is a question of clarification. That is what the Institute of Chartered Accountants believes about the clause, even if the Government's advisers do not. I should be grateful also if the Minister would outline the results of consultation on the clause. The Institute of Chartered Accountants says that the clause represents a significant change, so it is important that we know to what extent the various professional organisations support that change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may begin by discussing the generality of the distinction between the relationships outlined by the hon. Gentleman, and then move to the specifics. Loan relationships are divided into two broad categories—those for trade purposes and those for non-trade purposes. Where debts are held or owed for trade purposes, income and expenses from them are just included with all the other income and expenses of the trade in computing the overall profit or loss. If there is an overall profit, it is taxable, and if there is an overall loss it is relievable under the normal rules for trading profits and losses. One consequence is that that eliminates a longstanding discrimination between different sorts of borrowing for trade purposes, particularly in the rules determining the relief available when the result is an overall loss. In future, all trade borrowing will qualify for the favourable rules currently reserved for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>616</span>
borrowing from banks. We discussed that point this morning in a stand part debate on an earlier clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a personal ersatz example that helps me to distinguish a trading loan from a non-trading loan. A trading loan is made when a company borrows money to buy the lathe to make the widgets. A non-trading loan is made when a parent company—a holding company with a number of trading subsidiaries—borrows the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the difference between trading and non-trading loans is well known. The same distinction exists in many other places, including the legislation covering FOREX and financial instruments. It has not caused any problems there. That established definition runs through our tax law and is understood by financial professionals, both practitioners and participants, so is there a problem? When a known definition and a known distinction are used in a new context, it occurs to me that there is no problem of definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) made some specific points. I refer him to this morning's debate, when I laid out the three basic rules underpinning the clause. one is that the figures should follow those produced for non-tax purposes whenever that is acceptable. No prescriptive rules exist to say what tax treatment should apply, as tax treatment will follow the accounts. That is the beauty of the clause—it provides the flexibility that companies have sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cited three examples of what the Minister suggests is an easy matter in respect of which there are many precedents. I did not fully understand her reply. The Minister may consider that other people should share her familiarity with the matter, but the Institute of Chartered Accountants—which will have to interpret the provisions—clearly does not. The Insitute asked what would happen when a company borrowed to pay a dividend; to acquire its original trade or an additional trade; or to acquire a subsidiary or a new trading subsidiary whose trade immediately hives up. How does the clause apply in each of those cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had covered those points. No prescriptive rules are laid down—the tax treatment follows the accounts. That is, tax treatment on the specific aspects follows the accounting practices of the companies in question, and those accounting practices have to be within the two broad rules of accruals or mark to market. We shall come to those later. There are, of course, variations to cater for specific situations within those two broad principles and there are other matters to deal with for certain companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those principles cover the issue as well as the specific points raised by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire: whether one treats a specific type of loan in a specific way depends on the accounting treatment that is used for a specific company. That is the issue in question and the tax law follows the accounting treatment that has been used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg), perhaps it would be convenient for the Committee to say that amendments Nos. 287 to 295 refer to clause 75, Nos. 296 and 297 are consequential on schedule 7 and the balance goes into the dustbin schedule—schedule 13. The amendments are consequential on each other. I hope that that explanation helps the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to the FOREX legislation and are necessary to change the relief rules for losses so that companies do not lose credit for foreign tax. They meet the FOREX point made by the Chartered Institute of Taxation and others. I hope that all members of the Committee will welcome the amendments, which relax two restrictions in how non-trading debits—the losses on loan relationships—might be relieved. Without the amendments, some companies might lose some of the benefit of the setoff of foreign tax on their profits against United Kingdom corporation tax. In brief, the amendments will allow the companies affected to mix and match group relief, relief for foreign tax and losses under the new rules so as to make more use of the relief for foreign tax.

The amendments were suggested to us to ensure that with loan relationships, we follow more closely the FOREX legislation that has already been agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first of a series of groups of amendments that deal with capitalised interest, bad and doubtful debts, aborted loan expenses, late interest payments, provision relating to insurance companies and anti-avoidance rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments fall into two categories. The substantive amendment is amendment No. 277, of which the others—with the exception of amendment No. 175, which is a refinement that was proposed by the Law Society of England and Wales—are by-products. I shall therefore speak to amendment No. 277.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with capitalised interest. The reform is designed to ensure that borrowers receive relief for all their borrowing costs. We can generally achieve that by following the treatment in the company's own account. The Bill recognises that problems can arise when borrowing costs are capitalised into the cost of a fixed capital asset, which is not an uncommon practice. For accounting purposes, that capitalised cost would, in due course, be recognised in computing profits as the capital cost of the asset is depreciated. The deductions for depreciation are specifically not allowable for tax purposes. Without the amendments, there would be a risk that the borrowing costs would never be allowed at all once they were capitalised. That is a specialised but serious concern. It is particularly important for major capital projects, such as North sea oil production facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current provision allows tax relief in any period for the funding costs and incidental expenses that are capitalised into the accounts for that period, subject to the general rules about which accounting methods are acceptable and how they should be applied. Put another way, the interest is put into the accounts on an accrued basis and can therefore be offset against tax liability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Economic Secretary to Government amendment No. 277 and proposed new paragraph 13(2), about which we have received representations from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. According to the institute, the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the accounting period for which it is given"</p></blockquote>
are unclear; indeed, it thinks that they are "very unclear". It wants the Minister to clarify the meaning of those ambiguous words and say when capitalised interest will rank for tax relief. The Minister was almost there in her introduction, but further clarification—for example, of whether tax relief will arise in the year in which the interest is capitalised—is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my understanding. I might be able to go further. A number of points were made in representations which I shall group together to help the Committee. We were first asked about allowing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>620</span>
non-interest funding such as debt issued below par. It was also suggested that relief for incidental expenses would not be allowed. Another point was that allowances were made for interest too late or even not at all, if interest is not paid in cash but merely compounded in the books of the lender. Those are the main issues in the representations that we received, leaving aside minor drafting points to which I referred at the start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that all those points have been met. The paragraph does mean that relief is applicable when given during the period in which it is capitalised. I hope that that answers the final question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 204 to 216A are the substantive amendments, which relate to provisions about relief for lenders who do not get their money back and the tax charge on borrowers when a lender lets them off an obligation to repay a debt. They would rectify some unintentionally harsh results and ensure that the new rules do not put tax obstacles in the way of an important method used to rescue companies in financial trouble, such as debt-equity swaps. The remaining amendments make minor improvements in the wording, for example, by removing the word "may" which somehow appeared in three places wthout adding to the meaning. The amendments encompass the concerns that were raised. I am sure that the Committee will welcome them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will realise that there is considerable concern about the impact on share premium accounts. Can she reassure the Committee that capital raised on the sale of shares—the premium—will be treated not as income but as capital? Can she outline what is happening in respect of share premium accounts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 204 and subsequent amendments seek to tax profits taken into a reserve. How does that relate to insurance companies, given the recent changes with regard to the reserves that insurance companies can put aside to cover catastrophic losses? Can the Minister tell us how the amendment will affect companies that try to create legitimate reserves against emergencies that they perceive are likely to occur but which are not certain to occur? I accept that we should avoid taxing reserves held for a later distribution, but why do the provisions not seek to encourage companies to create reserves for legitimate self-insurance against an enormous problem that is reasonably likely to occur and which they will have to face?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does "any reserve" include the share premium account? The Institute of Chartered Accountants wants to know what will happen if funds are transferred to the share premium account for expenses on the issue of shares or debentures. Would they be taxable, especially if it were not required in law to transfer funds to the share premium account? Accountancy practice currently allows funds to be transferred; indeed, they often are transferred. Will tax relief still be available in those circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 76(3) admits the concept of charges and expenses incurred for certain purposes. The Law Society is not sure whether that is meant to cut down the natural meaning of the term
	<br><blockquote><p>"incurred for the purposes of a company's loan relationships and related transactions".</p></blockquote>
Does it include a company's legal fees, a lender's legal fees borne by the borrower, albeit directly billed to the lender as the lawyer's client, fees charged by a rating agency or stock exchange listing fees if the debt is quoted? The Minister may want to write to us on that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is clause 76(3)(c) intended to cover payments made on the loan relationships, not being interest—for example, reserve asset costs or withholding tax indemnities—or merely the incidental costs of affecting payments, such as bank charges? If it is the latter, how does a borrower obtain a deduction for periodical costs that do not constitute interest?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society also considers that an additional sub-paragraph (b) could usefully be added to subsection (3) covering the termination of loan relationships, such as by early repayment or by the repurchase of corporate debt in the market. That could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>622</span>
perhaps be included in subsection (5), which refers to the extinction of liabilities under a loan relationship and makes that a related transaction. Will the Minister give us her views on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 206 to 209 relate to schedule 8. The Institute of Chartered Accountants says that it welcomes the proposed amendments to limit the effect of the restriction on bad debt relief in relation to loans to participators. However, it remains of the view, given the anti-avoidance provisions, that there is no good reason for denying relief for genuine losses on bona fide commercial loan transactions between connected parties. It has already set out its views in its earlier submissions to us. Paragraph 98 of its original submission states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We can see no justification for a provision which denies tax relief for a loss which is actually being realised on a sale of the debt at arm's length, which seems to be the intention of subparagraph (5)."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 99 goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As we have already said in relation to Clause 79,"—which we are yet to come to—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"we also see no justification for restrictive treatment where one party is a participator in the other but has no control. However, so long as Clause 79 remains in its present form, we think that paragraph 6(4)(a) requires amendment".</p></blockquote>
Those are a couple of the points made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 211 would amend paragraph (6) of schedule 8 to allow bad debt relief in relation to a debt-for-equity swap. The problem is that it is not uncommon for an ailing company to make more than one such swap. It appears from amendment No. 211 that only the first swap would give rise to relief. Is that the case? If so, can the Minister tell us why that distinction is made? If the objective is to assist an ailing company, it seems something of an anomaly that a second swap, should it be necessary, would not qualify for similar relief. The Government may well have considered that, but if I am right about the anomaly, perhaps they might amend the measure appropriately on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, will relief normally be denied in typical management buy-outs or venture capital situations? Again, we have had draft representations—they have not yet been approved by the full body—from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. It is concerned that such relief will normally be denied in the situations that I have mentioned. Management buyouts can often bring some benefit to a company, depending on circumstances. Is it intended that that sort of tax treatment should apply in those cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 212 is interesting, but I should like substantial clarification. It appears to relate primarily to privatised companies. Am I right in saying that the Government are removing an intention implicit in the Bill, that the right of privatised debt should be taxed? If so, why are they removing it? Before the Bill was published, the law meant that such debt would not be taxed. It seems that the Government want to return the law to what it was before the Bill's publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what the implications of that will be for the write-off of Railtrack's debt? Are there any implications for the privatisation of nuclear power
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>623</span>
if it is sold to an American company—as may well happen if the Government get their way—or for other such privatisations? This part of the Bill is not politically controversial on the face of it, but unless we have a clear explanation of it, amendment No. 212 may well contain some political controversy. I hope that the Minister can satisfy me that it does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a query on amendment No. 211. As the hon. Member for North Warwickshire explained, it alters paragraph 6 of schedule 8 and deals with insolvency situations, company rescues and equity-debt swaps. The amendment refers to "ordinary share capital", but some debt equity rescues involve preference share capital, instead of or in addition to ordinary share capital. In that case, a bank holding preference shares could be regarded as having control of the company, under the definitions in the Taxes Acts, and therefore would not be entitled to relief. My hon. Friend probably understands that point; it would be helpful if we could have some reassurance on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help members of the Committee if I remind them of what this is all about—because although we have had some precision-bombing on the subject of definitions, the debate has missed the substance of the amendments. That substance is important and I shall explain it because it will answer most of the questions that have been asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, if a lender of a connected company releases the debt from the borrower, the borrower will always get a tax charge and the lender will not get any relief, except in special circumstances. With an unconnected company, the lender will get some tax relief if he releases the borrower, and the borrower can get a tax charge unless he is in liquidation. The amendments ensure that the debt relief procedure can have a better result. As I have explained, the present situation for connected companies is asymmetrical and we have amended it to give the lender no relief and the borrower no tax charge: that is much fairer. The amendments ensure that if a lender who undertakes a debt-equity swap with a borrower was unconnected when he entered that arrangement, he will remain unconnected. That is important because it means that equity can go one way to the lender in return for writing off some of the borrower's debt. If the lender remains unconnected, irrespective of the degree of that swap, he will always get tax relief. That makes it attractive for the lender in debt-equity swaps. However, the borrower would still be left with a tax charge and that could be a deterrent in a debt-equity swap. So we tabled another amendment to ensure that the tax charge in that debt-equity swap situation is entirely removed. If the hon. Gentleman considers that procedure, he will realise that it answers most of his questions; I found that the best way of working it out was to draw a little diagram, and he is welcome to have a copy whenever he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On share premium accounts, the amendment to clause 76(2) provides that amounts from share
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>624</span>
premium accounts are not taxed: that is the debt-equity swap, in which the borrower's charge is removed. That will ensure that there is no tax charge on the rescued company as a result of a debt—equity swap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On more than one debt-equity swap?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I shall make my points one by one. His answers will come. I should be most grateful if he would bear with me, because I have a fistful of paper. He also asked about reserves against emergencies. Profit transferred to reserve will be taxed unless legitimate expenses can be set against it. That represents no charge. That accounting practice is a fundamental principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:1 added a rider to that point. Is it right to tax that area? In the circumstances that I outlined, would not it be appropriate for a company to be encouraged to make such provision, provided the reserve was genuine and being established for a bona fide reason, not to be used for a later distribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I explained, we are not seeking to change the law on that. We want to ensure that debt-equity swaps—I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that they are important—can proceed and are facilitated. It is a general principle of tax law that tax deductions are not given unless expenses are incurred or will be incurred. A tax deduction cannot be granted just because expenses might be incurred. We have never given deductions for the sort of procedure described by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have personal experience of that area of taxation because I used to run a company. Accountants can deal with such procedures, which can put a company right. The system works satisfactorily. The hon. Gentleman also asked about relief on the costs of early repayment. There is no need for special rules on that. Normal accounting procedures should be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield asked about banks and debt-equity swaps. The issue is complicated, so I hope that he will bear with me because my response may take some time. He asked whether a bank which made a further loan to the rescued company would be denied bad debt relief on that further loan. The same problem would arise on any outstanding loans dating from before a debt-equity swap. The bank would be denied bad debt relief under the amended paragraph 6 of schedule 8 only if it controlled the rescued company or if it and the rescued company were controlled by a third party. That is not likely in any major commercial rescue situation.

The hon. Member for North Warwickshire asked about clause 76(3) and the way in which a borrower could obtain a deduction for periodical cost. The deduction is given for the costs as charged in accounts provided, allowable for the tax under the usual rules. As with many of the issues raised, the usual rules for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>625</span>
accounting practice should be followed. The difference in generality in this case is that the tax will follow the usual accounting practice to make life simpler for companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many respects, some of the clauses and alterations in the Bill are designed to cater for specific circumstances where it would otherwise be difficult to fit normal accounting practice into the generalities of accruals or mark to market. We are, therefore, making changes to ensure that the tax mould fully meets whatever normal accounting practice will be. In respect of debt-equity swaps and debt relief, we are trying to ensure that the proper balance is struck between what is fair, right and proper, and minimising loss to the Exchequer of tax revenue as a consequence of tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire asked about chartered accountants and symmetry. I hope that he agrees that I answered that point in my opening remarks, when I explained precisely the operation of the clause. He will be glad to hear that relief will not be denied in a typical venture capital case. However, some questions have been asked about how certain procedures will work, in response to which the Inland Revenue is offering guidance to representative bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's last point related to privatisation. He is correct to say that amendment No. 212 relates to that matter. The reason for that is that this part of the Bill unintentionally upset existing law in respect of privatised companies, which were released from obligations to repay money lent by the Government. The amendment would restore the old position, and ensure that it remains the same in future. There is no conspiracy—the amendment would merely ensure that the existing conditions continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reform is intended to align the tax treatment of debts without accounting treatment. In some circumstances, we still need special tax rules to prevent companies manipulating the new and simple general rules. The amendment will restrict those special rules to companies that are connected with each other. That is in response to several representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will change the rules that allow a tax deduction for interest. When a company is due to pay interest, it will normally accrue it in its accounts, but it may never actually pay the interest. If we followed the company's accounts alone, it would get tax relief even if it never paid the interest. The new rules say that companies can only get a deduction for interest if it is paid within 12 months of the end of the accounting period. According to several representations, however, the provision as drafted would cause significant problems. For example, banks and building societies will accrue interest on TESSA accounts each year, but do not pay the interest until the end of the contract, which can be up to four years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that those representations are correct. We did not seek to affect that area, so we have limited the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>627</span>
restriction of relief for interest to companies that are connected with another company. The rule is still needed for those companies because it is far easier for connected companies than independent ones to manipulate the rules so that they can obtain relief for interest without ever paying it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received representations from various professional bodies about the matter. For the sake of clarity, it would be helpful if the Minister would tell us the intentions behind the reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Chartered Accountants welcomes amendments Nos. 244 and 245, which would confine the effect of paragraph 2 of the schedule to connected relationships. It thinks that the asymmetry that will be produced between lender and borrower is unfair. The schedule should be further amended so that it applies only when the lender is not within the category of charged corporation tax or is taxed lender-only when the interest is received. What does the Minister think of that representation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification for the hon. Gentleman: amendment No. 346, which I tabled and which we shall discuss presently, deals with that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 346 seeks to deal with the problem. Perhaps we can discuss it when we come to that amendment. However, the Institute of Chartered Accountants raised the matter in relation to amendment No. 244.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 234 will alter paragraph 4 of the schedule with regard to foreign exchange gains and losses. It appears that the amendment is trying to deal with the point that is set out in paragraph 96 of the representation from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Unfortunately, it seems that the amendment will be effective to some extent, but it will not be fully effective; to become so, it should insert the words "or recognising the conversion" into the schedule. The change is necessary because a conversion is an actual transaction that gives rise to FOREX gain or loss. While an authorised accounting method will require a translation, it will recognise a conversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may take that matter on board and return to it on Report if they feel that it would be useful to do so. The point has been made previously in the institute's representations. It would be helpful if the Minister would give her view on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the substantive points raised on the restrictions, it might help the Committee if I explain that the amendments relating to interest, companies and rules are a consequence of going to the accruals method of accounting. Interest was often allowed only when it was paid, but now we will follow the accounts which will mean giving a tax deduction regardless of whether interest is paid. In referring to the accruals method of accounting, I should have said that we are making the tax system follow the existing accruals method of accounting better than it does at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the restriction, it would be too easy for connected companies to arrange matters so that we gave relief for interest without taxing an equivalent amount. We accept that an independent company is unlikely to go without interest due to it just so that another company can get a tax deduction. A simple example is that if I was to lend the hon. Member for North Warwickshire £50 and he did not repay me in the two weeks in which he had promised to repay me, I would be looking for him in every nook and cranny of the House of Commons because he and I are not connected. But if the hon. Gentleman was my brother, I would be tempted to shrug my shoulders and say, "It's just my brother borrowing money off me again. I don't expect to get it back." That is why there is a difference between a connected company and an unconnected company. An unconnected company will pursue with vigour the interest that it is owed and has not received, but a connected company is likely to let off one of its fellows more easily than is common in a commercial situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's substantive point relates to why we are making the constraints so tight. That may also be behind the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. We accept that a company that lends money to a connected company will not—unlike an independent company—usually be able to get bad debt relief if the interest is not paid. However, we need to protect the Exchequer where, despite the rules for bad debt relief, one company claims the deduction for interest which it does not pay while the lender does not pay tax on an equivalent amount of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we did not have that rule, two situations—possibly more—may arise and problems would occur. The first is where a company has interest payable to a company connected with it which is outside the scope of United Kingdom tax. An obvious example is a connected company in a tax haven. In such a case, we will allow a deduction for the interest payable, but we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>629</span>
will not be able to tax the other end of the transaction. The second possibility can apply even where both companies are within the United Kingdom. We give the borrower relief for the interest payable but the lender, although theoretically taxable on an equivalent amount, simply does not pay tax on that interest. That can be achieved fairly easily in a group situation by stripping all the assets from the lender company. It will then have a tax liability on interest but no money to meet that tax bill. So we still need to retain the safeguard of giving relief for interest only where it is actually paid in the group situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Government for tabling amendment No. 244, which has solved some of the problems relating to potential mismatches for interest under the late interest provisions contained in paragraph 2 of schedule 8. However, the mismatch will exist where there are connected companies. In such circumstances, it is proposed that tax relief on interest will not be given until the interest is paid. The late interest provisions provide for the recipient to be taxed on the interest, although the recipient did not receive the interest, and the payer of the interest will receive a deduction from the interest if the payment is delayed beyond 12 months. That will create a mismatch in certain situations. Amendment No. 346 would solve that problem by providing that the late interest restriction would be limited to situations in which the recipient would not be subject to either income or corporation tax in the United Kingdom on the receipt basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Minister told the Committee how the changes to loan relationships will help UK businesses. In general, she was right but if there are potential mismatches of interest relief for UK businesses, that will be damaging. One example has been brought to my attention of a business that would be caught by the provisions. Indeed, in their current form, the provisions are likely to have a serious detrimental impact on the group's financial standing. I shall call the company to which I am referrring ABC
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>630</span>
Ltd because it would like to preserve its anonymity. It is a property investment group that is listed on the London stock exchange. One of its investments is in a substantial UK office building, which is being built with a third party through a UK joint venture company, which I shall refer to as XYZ, in which ABC owns 50 per cent. of the shares, and the third party owns 49 per cent. So there is a connected relationship. Funding for the project has been entirely through the joint venture company in the form of an interest-bearing loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As often happens with property ventures, market conditions have turned adverse and XYZ, the joint venture company, has been unable to let the building as quickly as it intended, and the building is not generating sufficient rent to meet the interest payments on the interest charges arising from its ultimate parent. Nevertheless, the building is now fully let with good covenants, and the property is considered to be a good long-term capital investment. In those circumstances, the joint venture company is not generating sufficient cash to pay the interest to its parent company. No account will be taken of the company's problem, although it is a problem that arises for genuine commercial reasons. The holding company is, of course, unwilling to release the debt, as it would effectively confer a gratuitous benefit on the joint venture partner in the event that the joint venture company did not generate sufficient cash fully to settle its obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the parent company has to pay tax on the interest that has not been paid under the clauses as drafted because the joint venture company has been unable to pay its interest, that causes that company and its parent significant commercial difficulties. The parent company may be faced with the prospect of being forced to sell the property at a loss to generate cash to pay the interest and get the relevant tax relief. My amendment would avoid those problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does not ABC Ltd. exercise its security—and thus the risk—on its subsidiary XYZ Ltd., put it into liquidation and take control of 100 per cent. of its assets, thereby enabling it to benefit from the assets, which morally belong to the main debt holder in XYZ Ltd?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend will know, commercial life is not that simple. If one seeks to put into liquidation companies that one holds with a joint venture partner, that can substantially harm one's commercial relationships. I do not think that that is an option in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment No. 346 would restrict debt relief if the recipient of the interest is not subject to United Kingdom corporation tax. Abuse has occurred when groups with an international structure have sought to obtain debt relief in the United Kingdom and the debt relief has not been receivable in the United Kingdom and not subject to United Kingdom corporation tax, but in some tax haven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also tabled amendment No. 349, which relates to paragraph 16 of schedule 8. It is drafted in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>631</span>
similar terms and seeks to avoid the potential mismatch of interest that is taxed under paragraph 16. Paragraph 16 provides that where the companies party to the discount security are connected, the issuer will obtain relief for the discount only when the security is redeemed. The party that is redeeming the discount will get the debit in its tax computation when it is redeemed, but paragraph 16 provides for the recipient company that has provided the discount security to be taxed as the interest accrues. That is a potential mismatch that is disadvantageous to the businesses involved. My amendment would counter that problem by providing restriction on tax relief for United Kingdom companies if the relationship is with a company that is not resident in the United Kingdom, or one that is resident in the United Kingdom but not subject to income or corporation tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say to my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more serious note, whereas I cannot help my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West on the exactitude of the company's problems, I can deal with the generality of the problem of funding interest. If the accountants for the joint venture company are sufficiently confident that the interest will be paid to it and are, therefore, realising a profit, it is right that the joint venture company should pay tax on that profit, although they may well not do so. It is up to them to an extent because the fundamental principle here is that tax follows accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this situation, although the parent company accrues for receipt of the interest, it actually provides against the prospect of it being received. Even though the company makes provision for non-receipt of the interest it will, under the Bill as it stands, still be subject to tax on the accrual basis for the interest that it supposedly received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to consider that specific example, we shall require more information about it than the hon. Gentleman can give in Committee, given the need to maintain confidentiality. The fundamental principle, however, is that the tax follows the accounting, so the accounting needs to be examined further to determine whether we can properly address the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties with the amendments relate to tax avoidance. Although we have come half way towards each other between the present amendments and those that we have just discussed, the situation that I described could still be abused and the Exchequer left wide open to manipulation by groups of companies if the present restriction did not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's second amendment is a mirror image of the first. It relates to the discount that is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>632</span>
available to the issuer of debt. Under the new rules, a company that issues debt at a discount is entitled to tax relief on the amount of discount that it accrues in its accounts each year. That recognises that it will have to pay out more than it received when the debt is redeemed. When the holder of the discount of debt is a connected company, the issuer is not allowed a deduction for the discount until the debt is redeemed. That serves the same purpose as benign relief for interest that is not paid, which is why I said that the two amendments mirror each other in some respects. A company could issue discounted debt and claim relief for the accruing discount without ever redeeming the debt and paying more than the equivalent amount to the debtor. Therein lies the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I gave a rather long example on earlier amendments. I referred to a group of companies that set in motion a sequence of events that resulted in one company owing the tax, but managed, by virtue of being part of a group for its liability to be paid to move elsewhere.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed the hon. Lady's example. I was sceptical about it, as it implied that, to avoid tax, companies that are formed into a group could put into liquidation any company within the group that had made taxable profits.

Will she agree to re-examine the wording of the amendment, perhaps before the Bill returns on Report?

Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) has said. There seems to be considerable uncertainty about what the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"one of the main purposes"</p></blockquote>
in subsection (3A) in amendment No. 218 mean. There is some doubt whether one of the main purposes of any loan arrangement that involves the payment of interest is to obtain a tax deduction for the payment. Consequently, any loan would be likely to be caught by the amendment's wording. Will the Economic Secretary clarify the intention of the amendment and tell us whether the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or one of the main purposes"</p></blockquote>
could be removed, perhaps on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a similar concern. The words "a tax avoidance purpose" refer to any purpose that aims to secure a tax advantage. That might well be perfectly legitimate. I do not know what chapter I of part XVII of the Taxes Act 1988 has to say about

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>635</span>
tax advantage, or what is the difference between tax advantage and tax avoidance, but will my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary confirm that those anti-avoidance provisions will be applied only in remote cases where funds have been borrowed to fund private expenditure, rather than to fund the business? That would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will serve me right for moving the amendment formally. I should have given it an introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expression "main purpose" is commonly used in many other tax-avoidance provisions, and therefore, in other circumstances, so it is not unique to amendment No. 218. However, I understand the concern of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a moment when my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham mentioned me, I thought that we were not friends, but I am grateful that we still are. Clearly, there is concern that taxpayers must be able to plan their finances with certainty. The paragraph will affect borrowing only where it is not for the commercial business purpose of the company; even then, any disallowance will be on a just and reasonable basis. Furthermore, it will impose a disallowance of relief in respect of tax-avoidance purposes only when that is the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the loan relationship. Companies will know perfectly well when they plan their financing whether tax avoidance is such a purpose. The wording is familiar and is used elsewhere in tax legislation. I hope that that also covers the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
