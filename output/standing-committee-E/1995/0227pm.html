<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p><b>(Except clauses 36, 105, 112 and 139 and schedule 15)</b></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. This morning a number of points of order were raised in respect of the 166 amendments tabled by the Government on loan relationships. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) suggested that we should delay our consideration of some clauses for proper consultation to take place.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary told us that various organisations that had been consulted did not want such a delay. I know that the hon. Lady would not seek to mislead the Committee—I say that genuinely—but it appears that her information was not as clear as it might have been. A degree of confusion has been created, as is clear from conversations I have had this afternoon with those representing the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. I shall deal first with the Chartered Institute of Taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman could tell me precisely the point of order that he is raising. When he tells me, I shall be able to offer a ruling on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of order is about statements made this morning that have subsequently caused confusion. Is it permissible for me to acquaint the Committee with what has been said to me this afternoon? It relates closely to the confusion created by the Economic Secretary's comments this morning. Her Department may need to rectify any confusion in order properly to inform the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point of order except for the fact that it is not a point of order. The explanation provided for amendments is not a matter for me. Neither the time scale of placing amendments nor their consideration is a matter for me. I must be satisfied that amendments are properly tabled and in order, which they are. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) may shake his head, but the amendments have been tabled and a selection has been made. The amendments will be considered in order as we reach them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Mr. Hogg, but you mistake my point of order. It is not about whether the amendments are properly tabled, which, I accept, was dealt with this morning. The issue before the Committee now is whether certain statements upon
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 546</span>
which the Committee was entitled to rely were accurate. May I now place before the Committee, as a point of order, information that casts doubt on statements made this morning?<br><br>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation has told me in a statement made through the chairman of its technical committee that it is uncomfortable about proceeding with the amendments. It wants more time and it has proposed a delay until I July. Similarly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants has not endorsed the amendments. Indeed, Mr. Vidler, secretary to its technical committee, said that one of his associates, Mr. Colin Campbell, was going to do a wet towel job to see what the amendments meant. The meaning of the amendments is simply not known, so the organisation has not endorsed them and the Committee should not be under any misapprehension that it has.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary will have heard the hon. Gentleman's comments and may want to reply. It is not a matter for me, although it would be in order for the hon. Lady to address the Committee if she wants because the hon. Gentleman mentioned the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. Members of the Committee will recall that I said this morning that the amendments were in response to representations from those organisations, and I reiterate that.<br><br>
As regards the Chartered Institute of Taxation, I last met with its representatives on Valentine's day—14 February—and it supported the legislation. Representatives of the British Bankers Association have rung us in the past two or three days and are concerned that we continue with the Bill. I have with me comments from other representative bodies, which have been part of our consultation process and from which we have written representations. Representatives of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales wrote that they
<br><blockquote><p>"support the move to tax interest and other amounts arising from loan relationships on a basis which more closely follows the treatment adopted in the accounts".</p></blockquote>
The Law society said:
<br><blockquote><p>"we welcome the proposed new regime, which is substantially in line with the reforms we suggested in the submissions",</p></blockquote>
which it had made.<br><br>
I have other comments along the same lines.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns. If we lived in a perfect world, we would have time to consult as much as we could and make everything absolutely right before we brought it before a Committee.<br><br>
We began the initial consultation in April and subsequently faced demands from representative bodies. Businesses are now arranging their affairs to take account of the changes from 1 April. It is clear from the representations that we have received that those who will be directly affected consider a delay to be the worse option; they would prefer us to make progress towards providing them with a simpler

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 547</span>
legislative framework for complex corporate debt situations.<br><br>
I have not said anything different from what I said this morning. I have, however, amplified one aspect and explained the situation as it has been set out to us in telephone conversations and in writing.<br><br>
We shall I hope, be in contact with members of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants before they go home this evening to verify their precise views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That seems to me to be helpful.</span></p>

RATE BANDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: During our discussions this morning, the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire referred to inheritance tax avoidance. My hon. Friend mentioned conditional exemption from inheritance tax in particular. During lunch, I had the opportunity to walk round the royal parks and I want to draw that issue to the Financial Secretary's attention—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Draw attention to the walk?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may walk with me any time, although I am not sure that he could keep in step or keep up. I want, however, to raise the issue of conditional exemption from inheritance tax, which is granted in return for allowing access to land on death.<br><br>
Previous Committees on the Finance Bill have considered this important issue. Exemption can be given in return for access to works of art and land. There has been some improvement in public access to works of art. The Inland Revenue has customised records. I have used the system; it is bureaucratic but can be made to work.<br><br>
I want to press the Financial Secretary on the issue of access to land in the countryside. No one knows where that land is. Simply put, granting public access to land is a means of avoiding inheritance tax but, because of clause 182 of the Finance Act 1989, no one will say where that land is. The Minister has said in parliamentary answers that he would let heritage organisations—in this case the Countryside Commission—inform the public. I have been in touch with that organisation and it will not or cannot tell me where the land is. The former Financial Secretary, the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) said during the passage of a Finance Bill in 1992 that local authorities were consulted about the matter, and in a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 548</span>
reply to a parliamentary question I was told in which counties that land and property were.<br><br>
In conjunction with the Ramblers' Association, I have written to all those local authorities; the Minister will be interested in their replies. Of the 25 local authorities who responded to the survey—many authorities are being disbanded—12 said that they were not aware of the land or access in their area, 12 said that they were and Derbyshire, which is always an exception in such matters, said that it did have that information but had learnt of it not from the Revenue but from the local press. That is worrying. I have been assured that local authorities are consulted about that land, so that they, with the Countryside Commission, can publish details of access to it, but it is clear that that is not happening; the get-out clause that is being used is that confidential tax matters are involved. I put it to the Minister that that simply is not good enough and that the public will not put up with it. The Countryside Commission will not say where the land is, the local authorities cannot say where it is and the poor old public are left in the dark.<br><br>
I understand, again from parliamentary answers, that more than 100 sites are involved. The exemption concerns millions of pounds. What makes that bad state of affairs worse is the fact that many Members, from both sides of the Chamber, have pressed the issue for many years. During the course of the Committee, we have been assured that the Bill will make things clearer, but we are still walking in the dark—or rather we are not walking in the dark, because the public, who have forgone the benefit of the proceeds of inheritance tax, do not know where the land is. The matter remains to be resolved. The issue is important. I seek an undertaking that the Financial Secretary will consider it and perhaps, in the light of his discussions, talk to the access groups, particularly the Ramblers' Association, about their concerns.<br><br>
I said at the outset that I support the clause. I also support conditional exemption from inheritance tax in return for public access on land. It is a good principle and I am disappointed that it does not work. All over the country, people are crying out to enjoy and walk our countryside. They want the environment to be enhanced and to see the landscape lifted. People should forgo the benefit of inheritance tax to give the public the access that they presently do not enjoy. Put simply, I hope that the Minister will act urgently on the issue.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a couple of points about conditional exemption, but before I do, I state a simple truth: it is right to tax inherited wealth. That point is constantly made by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Walden) in his writings in the London <i>Evening Standard.</i> It is quite right to tax inherited wealth and the principle goes way back to the Stamps Act 1694, but the Prime Minister now tells us that he intends, when appropriate, to abolish inheritance tax so that wealth can cascade "down the generations", to use his words.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0530">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 549</span>
In an earlier debate on the Bill, I referred to the latest edition of <i>Social Trends,</i> which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Wealth is much more unequally distributed than income and this has not changed much over the years."</p></blockquote>
That is true. I quoted the statistic that 50 per cent. of the population owns 8 per cent. of the country's wealth and that has not changed since 1976. The series of <i>Social Trends</i> goes back to 1976 and stops.<br><br>
Much inherited wealth is tied up in land. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) drew attention to the problems and I want to touch briefly on conditional exemption for access to land. Six people—I do not know their names or addresses because those are confidential and the Inland Revenue will not release the details—in Lancashire get conditional exemption from inheritance tax by virtue of the fact that they allow members of the public to walk on their land. The problem is that we do not know where their land is. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood and I have tabled parliamentary questions and received a stonewalling reply: "We can't tell you because it would be a breach of taxpayer confidentiality." That has got to change. It is an absolute abuse. People have known about the problem for years. It was mentioned in the Committee considering the 1992 Finance Bill, so we are not springing a new problem on Ministers.<br><br>
On the second aspect of conditional exemption, I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood that I disagree that there has been an improvement in public access to privately owned works of art. That might be his experience, but it is not mine. The register of conditionally exempt works of art is held in four locations in the United Kingdom—Belfast, Edinburgh, Cardiff and here in London at the Victoria and Albert museum. I went along to the V and A to consult the register of conditionally exempt works of art; I wanted to know who in Lancashire possessed those valuable works of art because I wanted to go and visit them. I am interested in such matters.<br><br>
I called up on the screen the honourable Fermor-Hesketh who lives at 70 Drayton gardens, London SW 10. He owns a set of three Brussels Garden tapestries, which I would be interested to look at, and another French tapestry panel. The register of conditionally exempt works of art informed me that those tapestries were held at an unspecified location in Lancashire and that the telephone number was ex-directory. So, I do not think that I shall see those tapestry panels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have examined the clause that we are debating and I cannot find any justification for discussing tapestries of any sort held by anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just a bit of embroidery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly that. I hope that the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) will now come into order. It is a good speech and I am enjoying it, but it is not in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will. My central point, which was also made by the hon. Member for Stamford and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 550</span>
Spalding, is that inheritance tax catches the small fry but the big fish swim free. If I may finish my point briefly, when <i>The Independent on Sunday</i> did a survey of 18 works of art that were listed in the register, a third of the owners gave addresses or telephone numbers that were out of date or incorrect.<br><br>
Bringing myself rapidly back into order, I want to focus on what the Prime Minister said in the House in July last year—words to which my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire alluded. The Prime Minister told us that he intended to abolish inheritance tax
<br><blockquote><p>"when it is appropriate and we can afford to do so".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 July 1995; Vol. 263. c. 1085]</p></blockquote>
How will that work in practice? Will the inheritance tax threshold be moved upwards year after year? I think we should be told. Furthermore, if inheritance tax is going to be abolished, what will be used to replace its yield, which is put at about £1.5 billion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was carried back to my county of Lancashire by the remarks of the hon. Member for Pendle. The hills of Lancashire were in my mind when suddenly I was brought rudely back to the present moment and my reply.<br><br>
It has been an interesting and illuminating discussion, because we have had an insight into the attitudes of Opposition Members towards wealth that ultimately becomes inherited. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire told us that he was in favour of lots of millionaires, which indicates that he is in favour of creating wealth. However, he then told us—and his hon. Friends confirmed it—that if one cannot get rid of all one's wealth in one's lifetime, one crosses over the line where the politics of envy come into play. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire was not clear about exactly what the Opposition would do. I can draw the conclusion only that all existing reliefs to inheritance tax are under threat from the Labour party. Labour Members were probed three times by questions from those on the Conservative Benches, but three times they were unable to give a clear and unequivocal answer. I shall say more about that in a moment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Pendle took us a long way back to the 17th century and gave us his historical perspective on inheritance tax. My historical perspective starts a little nearer the present time. Around the turn of the century—just before the first world war, in fact—[HON. MEMBERS: "Be precise."' Yes—I will be specific. Just before the start of the first world war, estate duty—as it was at the time—represented some 30-odd per cent. of the Inland Revenue taxes that were gathered.<br><br>
One can understand why; taxes on inherited wealth, in the form of estate duty, were an important source of revenue at that time. There was a relatively narrow tax base and no VAT, capital gains tax, corporation tax or national insurance charge, so taxing the rolled-up wealth through estate duty was a good way of getting at people's income, which could not be taxed in any other way. To contrast that with the present situation, inheritance tax now represents a very small proportion
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0531">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 551</span>
of the total tax take. Given the fact that the tax base has broadened substantially, it is right to consider the abolition of inheritance tax in due course. There is a variety of ways of taxing people's income, as I have mentioned, and the job that estate duty set out to do is becoming less important. For the reasons that have been alluded to, it is the Conservative party's clear, stated policy that we will, in due course—when we can afford to do so—eliminate inheritance tax.<br><br>
The Opposition have not caught up with the fact that inheritance tax is now a middle-income, middle-England phenomenon and not just the preserve of so-called rich people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister's argument for getting rid of inheritance tax, particularly as it applies to millionaires, that we now tax other people so much that we should tax them more and let millionaires off inheritance tax? That is the logic of what he is saying. Can he explain the argument for abolishing inheritance tax for millionaires?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with those points in due course. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not take the same line as his hon. Friend the Member for Pendle, who reminded us of the history of inheritance tax. At the turn of the century, there was not such a broad base for income tax. People's wealth was their rolled-up income over time and inheritance tax was one way of taxing that. At the time, inheritance tax represented 30 per cent. of tax revenue, so it was an important tax. The historic point is that it is now a much less significant source of tax revenue because of the broadening base of income tax. We tax people during their lifetime, when they are earning and creating their wealth.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire is out of touch if he does not realise that many ordinary people are frightened that their valued possessions—their houses and their limited wealth—will be under threat from inheritance tax. I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Sherwood, who accepted the thrust of the clause, which increases the limit to £200,000. At least some Opposition Members acknowledge the need to respond to people's fears. Because of that fear, we want gradually to ease the burden of inheritance tax over time. Those people do not consider themselves to be rich, but they are deeply worried that inheritance tax will take away the wealth that they want their successors to be able to enjoy. That is what drives us forward.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire read out a list of people this morning. I was struck by one of the names on that list—it is a controversial one. I refer to Lord Archer for a reason: anyone who read his first book will know that that man, because of the problems he faced, started off with nothing and created his wealth by his skill as an author. I shall not dwell too long on the personal affairs of an individual, but others in that list have also made their money by virtue of their intelligence and skills.<br><br>
The argument expounded by Opposition Members is an example of the politics of envy. They believe in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 552</span>
penalising people who have worked hard and, as a result of their labours, have given employment and opportunities to hundreds if not thousands of people.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have two wise monkeys left now. I listened to what the hon. Gentleman said, but I want to make more progress on inheritance tax.<br><br>
We want to move towards circumstances in which the tax can ultimately be removed. In 1975–76, some 49,000 estates paid inheritance tax. In the 1995–96 financial year, the figure is 21,000. As a result of this provision, a further 7,500 estates will be relieved of inheritance tax and there will be a substantially reduced tax bill for the remaining 15,000. Only one in 45 deaths will lead to inheritance tax bills for heirs.<br><br>
The process towards easement is clearly a development supported by both sides of the Committee. The party to which the hon. Member for Warwickshire belongs introduced easements affecting the wealth passing between spouses, so his party clearly shares my view. The difference between us is about how far to go. We believe in going all the way to abolition. The hon. Gentleman's party believes that envy and resentment is created at some unspecified point—he will not tell us at what precise point—about wealth that is often accumulated as a result of the sweat of people's brows in their own lifetimes. The hon. Gentleman spoke about an accident of history, but it can be the accident of gifts that individuals enjoy which produces the wealth that is created.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I suppose that I should give way to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that he is being unintentionally irresponsible by giving the impression to very rich people that they will not have to pay inheritance tax in future. He is inviting them not to make arrangements ahead of their death to spread their wealth more fruitfully but to wait for a future Conservative Government even more friendly to the rich before passing everything on to their chosen heirs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to discuss too widely the various ways in which people may dispose of their wealth in a tax-efficient manner for the benefit of others. In previous Committees considering Finance Bills, we discussed venture capital trusts, enterprise investment schemes and many other methods through which wealth can be used to the advantage of other people. Some people on the list read out this morning have achieved just that through the fruits of their labours.<br><br>
I should like to draw to the attention of the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) what my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor said in his Budget speech, which illustrates another dimension. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is a myth that inheritance tax is paid only by the very rich. In fact, the very rich are well placed to dispose of their wealth in their own lifetime."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 November 1995; Vol. 267, c. 1070.]</p></blockquote>
It is the group between those who can take such action and those who are currently affected by the present limit on inheritance tax that the provision is aimed at. The frightened of middle England include inhabitants of some 900,000 homes that are each worth about £160,000. Those people are not able to make a disposal because they need their homes, chattels and movables to carry on their day-to-day living.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire is interested in wealth creating. I was interested to hear that. He sees the value of people's estates growing, yet he appears not to want to tell people what will happen to their wealth. That is because he cannot make clear his party's policy on that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has suggested that the Opposition have not been clear about that. On the contrary: £200,000 is an acceptable amount to be exempt from inheritance tax at this time. We are happy to see the clause go through.<br><br>
Will the Minister now deal with the real point, which is those who are above that level, the millionaires? He says that they ought to be able to retain all their wealth and pass it on through the generations, but he is not dealing with that: he is arguing about something else, on which both sides of the Committee agree. Let him deal with the issues that are matters of debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to let the hon. Gentleman off the hook, because he is missing the point. I sense
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
that the Labour party is happy with an upper limit of £200,000. If, therefore, one has £210,000, £250,000, or £300,000, one is out, although such people cannot be counted in the ranks of the wealthy, the millionaires, the rich. The hon. Gentleman has not made a clear-cut case on his party's stance on those people. He said that he would like to see many millionaires. I am therefore assuming that anyone on the way to having £1 million might be okay. The removal of inheritance tax will not be enjoyed by wealthy people who are dead. It is the successors, the estates and those who will use the wealth who will enjoy the money, and they may well make it work very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being unable to take part in the debate earlier; perhaps my point has already been made, in which case my hon. Friend the Minister can tell me abruptly.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to the recipients of inherited wealth as well as the donors. Has he considered the argument, which has long been around, that with a generous inheritance tax-exempt amount of, say, £200,000, as we have now, it would be socially more just and more effective in terms of wealth distribution—in which we believe—for the tax to be levied not on the donor or on the donor's estate but on the recipients? By thus combining a relatively high tax-exempt amount such as £200,000 with a tax on the recipients, would not one give every encouragement through the tax system for wealth to be as widely distributed as possible? We in the Conservative party should believe in that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listen with interest to my hon. Friend, who always puts forward challenging thoughts about the future workings of the tax system. However, I have some difficulty with his argument for the reasons that I gave. Whichever side of the divide we tax, we tax the wealth that people have created during their lifetime.<br><br>
The issue was summed up for me by some more words of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor during the Budget speech. I shall deal with the specific points of the hon. Members for Sherwood and for Pendle shortly, but I want to conclude the general debate on inheritance tax with a brief quotation from my right hon. and learned Friend. It sums up the situation well. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many people who do not consider themselves rich work hard and save for their families throughout their whole lives. They pay their taxes when they work. They want to pass on their family capital without having it taxed again when they die. Many people want to pass on an inheritance to their children and their grandchildren to give them a better start in life than they had. That is a natural instinct in families. Inheritance is now an issue for middle Britain. It is to help middle Britain that we aim to abolish inheritance tax as soon as we can afford to do so."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 November 1995; Vol. 267, c. 1070.]</p></blockquote>
That is the most succinct summary I can give as to the reason we support the clause and, by extension, the removal of inheritance tax.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sherwood touched on several general points and I hope that he will forgive me if, in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0533">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 555</span>
order to avoid repetition, I do not run over them again. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Pendle both touched on a matter that causes them particular difficulty, but before I deal with that, my notes remind me that the hon. Member for Sherwood asked me two specific questions. It would be churlish of me not to reply to them. The hon. Gentleman talked about the yield of inheritance tax, which I can confirm is £1.5 billion. He also asked for details of what would have happened if we had simply indexed the inheritance tax allowance. Starting from the financial year 1993–94, in the respective years it would have been £154,000, £157,000, £161,000 and £167,000. I hope that that answers his specific questions.<br><br>
On access to conditionally exempt land—the hon. Member for Pendle raised related points—I have been tracking parliamentary questions carefully. I was troubled that people had concerns and I understood them.<br><br>
Before I talk about the land issue, however, I want to confirm the situation on works of art. We are seriously considering improving access to information by using more modern technology—in this case, the internet. We obviously have to evaluate how that can be done, but I am reasonably certain that we can do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the worries about combining access to works of art with the easy accessibility of data on their location is security. Will my hon. Friend give an assurance that, if access to information about the location of works of art is given via the internet, advice will also be given to the people who look after them on how to secure them properly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that point. That is why my reply was ever so slightly hesitant. If we give out information, we must consider such issues. I know of a person who attempted to abuse the privilege of access to see a piece of furniture.<br><br>
Land was central to the comments of the hon. Members for Sherwood and for Pendle. From the information that I have received, it is possible to achieve both objectives if we care to ferret out the facts. On the one hand, we need to respect the need for. taxpayer confidentiality, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) said. On the other hand, we need to respect the fact that access should be available to land in exchange for that benefit. At present, if one goes to a local tourist centre, one will discover that a list of land that is open to the public is available, and the hon. Member for Pendle will know that members of the public can acquire such information in many places in Lancashire. In this case, the only distinction is that land that is affected by conditional exemption procedures is not expressly shown as such—it is included with the land that is open to the public. Access and information can, therefore, be offered via that mechanism without breaking taxpayer confidentiality.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 556</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that intention. If that were the case in practice, I would be happy. The Minister asked me to ferret about, but all the ferreting that I have done suggests that that is not the case and that the public do not know about large areas of land. I reaffirm my offer to put people in touch with the Minister to examine the issue, about which there are real concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. The hon. Gentleman asked me in gentlemanly terms whether I would give him an undertaking to examine the matter carefully. Before I take him up on that and have many people queuing up at the door to offer me information, I shall reconsider the facts of the matter. I that way, I shall ensure that I am as sighted as I ought to be. I have followed debate on the issue, and I mentioned the internet precisely because I was probed in a parliamentary question and asked the Revenue to reexamine the situation. I shall consider the matter because it has been raised in all genuineness. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept that the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 171 and 172 make several changes to the rules on stamp duty on shares and the stamp duty reserve tax. As the Inland Revenue press release of 4 January this year states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most of these changes are designed to take account of the introduction of the paperless shares transfers under the CREST system, which are due to come in July 1996."</p></blockquote>
CREST is the replacement of the ill-fated TAURUS project and it is essential for London not only that CREST is a success—which TAURUS was not—but that ownership of shares can be transferred quickly, safely and with the minimum of formalities. CREST replaces TALISMAN, the existing settlement system for stock exchange transactions, so CREST in fact replaces the disastrous TAURUS, which was to replace TALISMAN. CREST will also handle many off-market transactions, many of which will not be sales. For example, executors could use the CREST system to distribute shares to beneficiaries when a deceased person's estate is wound up.<br><br>
I should like to make some brief comments about the CREST system and ask the Minister some questions; giving that clause 172 relates to subsequent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 557</span>
clauses, I shall also tag on some questions on the replacement of the stamp duty reserve tax for those transactions in the CREST system if you, Mr. Hogg, will permit me. The matters are complicated and I shall take them slowly and succinctly.<br><br>
Clause 172 provides for the transfer of shares into electronic transfer systems such as CREST to be exempt from stamp duty. The fixed 50p stamp duty charge that would otherwise arise on deposits of shares into the CREST system will accordingly not arise, which seems sensible. Once shares are transferred into CREST, they will become dematerialised and transfers of legal title will take place electronically. Stamp duty will therefore not apply as it is a tax on instruments. The charge that will now apply once shares are held in CREST is the stamp duty reserve tax, hence the measures contained in the subsequent clauses. There are differences between stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax and the Bill makes several changes to the latter to bring it into line with stamp duty, but does not do so in all cases. The Government seem again to be widening the scope of the stamp duty reserve tax—SDRT—in the interests of the Inland Revenue but not of the taxpayer. The SDRT applies to any oral or written agreement for the transfer of shares for consideration in money or money's worth, but not all those transactions will attract ad valorem stamp duty, which applies only where the consideration is money or shares. There are, therefore, circumstances in which the stamp duty reserve tax charge would arise, but an ad valorem stamp duty charge would not.<br><br>
Moreover, there are situations in which there is a stamp duty exemption—for example, transfers between associated companies and company reconstructions—but no equivalent stamp duty reserve tax relief. It would appear from the material that has been put out by CREST Co., especially the white book that was issued last year, that no attempt will be made to replicate within the stamp duty reserve tax legislation the stamp duty exemptions from ad valorem duty. Indeed, the Bill as currently drafted does not do that either. That seems a little odd. To obtain the benefit of stamp duty exemptions effectively for stamp duty reserve tax, stocks will have to be dematerialised—they will have to be taken out of the system or documents will have to be created to back up transactions that have already been settled within the CREST system. That seems most peculiar given the emphasis that Ministers have placed on everyone being as efficient as possible and given the undertakings on deregulation. CREST participants will have to incur additional costs because of the failure of the Bill as it stands to replicate for stamp duty reserve tax the stamp duty exemptions. Perhaps the Economic Secretary could deal with that point when she comments later.<br><br>
Moreover, it would appear from the CREST Co. white book that the Revenue is requiring CREST participants to give details of transactions where there is no consideration in either money or money's worth and where, therefore, there can be no question of a stamp duty reserve tax charge. For example, CREST participants might be required to state by means of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 558</span>
computer "flag" whether a transfer of shares is a gift, a distribution in liquidation or a transfer of shares from the executor to the beneficiary. That information is certainly needed for stamp duty purposes, but there is no statutory warrant for that information to be required where the charge is to the stamp duty reserve tax. The only information that the Revenue appears to be entitled to under the stamp duty reserve tax rules is confirmation that there is no consideration in money or money's worth. There is no need for the Revenue to have the further information once that simple fact has been established.<br><br>
If the Economic Secretary believes that the Revenue should be given the additional information for stamp duty reserve tax purposes, the right course is surely to bring before Parliament specific proposals to do exactly that. That has not happened. Perhaps the Economic Secretary could undertake to consider that point, which is quite detailed. If she cannot give an explanation to the Committee today, as I appreciate she might not be able to, perhaps she could write to explain how the point is covered.<br><br>
The Government want to adjust the stamp duty reserve tax rules to take account of CREST in relation to the territorial scope of the tax. My following questions relate to subsequent clauses, Mr. Hogg, but they follow directly from my comments. The Revenue's note on clause 173 makes it clear that the charge to stamp duty reserve tax will in future apply when the transaction is undertaken outside the United Kingdom, whether or not any of the parties to it are resident or situated in the United Kingdom. Although that has been presented to us as a clarification of the law, it represents a significant change of interpretation of the law. The official notes on stamp duty reserve tax issued when the tax was introduced in 1986 state, that
<br><blockquote><p>"a charge is not regarded as arising where a non-resident buys chargeable securities from another non-resident and the agreement to transfer is made abroad."</p></blockquote>
When a transaction is settled using CREST—the legal transfer takes place in CREST—it is reasonable that stamp duty reserve tax should apply whether or not the parties are non-resident. Stamp duty would be paid in those circumstances and a stock transfer form would be executed.<br><br>
The implication of imposing the stamp duty reserve charge on non-CREST transactions carried out abroad where there is no transfer of legal title and no connection with the United Kingdom, except that the transaction relates to United Kingdom shares, needs careful consideration. Parliament has traditionally been cautious—and rightly so—of imposing taxes on people or on transactions over which it has no sovereignty. It is arguable whether we should impose taxes that we cannot enforce.<br><br>
There are issues to be considered when United Kingdom shares are traded on foreign stock exchanges. However, there are exemptions where shares are traded abroad—in New York, for instance—in depository form or where settlement is within a clearance system to which a 1½, per cent. clearance system charge applies. Those exemptions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 559</span>
will not necessarily cover every case. In some circumstances, the beneficial ownership of shares changes and the stamp duty-related tax that arises from that will not he covered by the exemptions. The Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants have suggested that clause 173 is unnecessarily wide and therefore difficult to operate.<br><br>
I am grateful for your patience, Mr. Hogg. This is a technical and specialised area of the law—there are many such areas in this Finance Bill. It would be preferable if clause 173 were restricted to transactions using CREST. The Revenue should publish a consultative document on the proposal to extend stamp duty reserve tax. If there is a case for doing that, the necessary provisions could be included in next year's Finance Bill.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with some of those points today, but if she is unable to give a complete explanation, perhaps she would write to members of the Committee as I am sure it would help us with the clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right that this is a technical area relating in particular to the CREST settlement system, which we hope will be up and running in July this year. In a forerunner to this debate, the hon. Lady and I discussed the uncertificated securities regulations, which must have dematerialised the rest of the Committee as we were out of there particularly quickly.<br><br>
Many of the hon. Lady's concerns relate to the difference between stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax. Stamp duty reserve tax was a back up that was introduced as a consequence of the big bang. As such, it did not have quite the same coverage as stamp duty and it was deemed to be more of a mop up and a minor player in the field. With CREST coming on stream this year, SDRT will gradually—possibly rapidly—become the principal route by which duty will be payable on these shares. The key to all the clauses is to ensure that SDRT matches the existing scope of stamp duty, that we provide a system whereby SDRT can be collected using the new CREST system, and that anti-avoidance provisions, which the hon. Lady mentioned briefly, are in place.<br><br>
The 50p charge will be abolished when certificates are put into CREST because although many people taking part in the transactions will have their shares in nominees and will continue to do so, others—especially small retail shareholders—will wish to keep their shares in certificated form. If there is no charge for putting a certificate into CREST prior to sale, the person remaining with certificated shares should not be disadvantaged.<br><br>
I contest that we are not widening the scope of SDRT compared with that of stamp duty; we are widening the scope of existing SDRT coverage to a new coverage to match it up with the coverage of stamp duty. One is different from the other.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 560</span>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are not widening the tax, why does the Red Book forecast a 20 per cent. increase in revenue from stamp duty in the next financial year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principal reasons are the greater liquidity and business done in the City of London and—dare I say it—the buoyancy of the British economy. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]<br><br>
The SDRT point is a fine one. At present it does not have the same coverage as stamp duty because it was brought in as a mop-up tax dealing with a minority of operations. It will become more significant in future. As it rapidly becomes the major vehicle through which tax is levied on transactions, it will need the same coverage as stamp duty—the paper version, one might say. So the question of territorial scope relates to that.<br><br>
I wish to deal with the issues mentioned by the Law Society and by the Institute of Chartered Accountants to which the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) referred. The present territorial scope of stamp duty applies to charges on a UK share or foreign shares on a UK register irrespective of whether the buyer or seller are UK residents. That is the current position. With SDRT, that does not apply. The coverage is different. That is where the discrepancy lies.<br><br>
Most transactions are likely to be settled by either a stamped transfer document or a paperless transfer through CREST. It therefore makes sense for the same coverage to apply in that respect. I accept that there may be cases when the tax on individual transactions cannot be collected because those involved are not resident in the UK or are not part of a clearance service, which is encompassed by the provisions. An agency cross may be involved. We must ensure that a minimum amount of avoidance is possible so the tax has been changed to effect that.<br><br>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants provided an interesting example of an oral agreement being reached on the sale of shares in a UK-quoted company between a Russian vendor and a Finnish purchaser. It asked why SDRT should be paid. If nothing more than oral agreement is reached, it is unlikely that anyone outside the two parties will ever find out. But the purchaser is likely to want ownership of shares registered, either by a paper transaction or through CREST. So, that representation does not stack up well under scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has got a point: one could imagine a Latvian-born business man who has a well-known company making oral agreements to transfer shares to other companies within his empire and using the share certificates to secure loans for his company. We have had an example of that and the point needs to be addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that the Institute of Chartered Accountants makes is that SDRT should not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 561</span>
cover that transaction, whereas it is willing to have stamp duty covering it. If the major tax will in future be SDRT, one asks oneself why it should not cover something that is covered by stamp duty. It makes sense to have the same coverage. The system is not perfect and transactions that we do not catch will doubtless take place. But, if someone sets up overseas without telling anyone what he is doing, with a nominee account into which he has got people to put their shares, and changes the ownership between his customers through that nominee, he will eventually be caught. The shares will be UK-registered and it will be known that some form of clearance service is operating; the legislation covers the clearance system and there will, therefore, be a levy of duty on those transactions. We will not catch transactions in all instances, but we do not want to leave loopholes in the legislation.<br><br>
The next point made by the hon. Lady for Bristol, South was on SDRT exemptions; she was concerned that some were not as generous as stamp duty. The primary and most obvious such exemption will relate to the members of SEPON—the stock exchange nominees—transferring their shareholding out of SEPON and into CREST. Because of the nature of SEPON, it could be argued that those shares are pooled and that no one company could identify its special parcel of shares. Therefore, if a company transfers its shareholding out of SEPON, it is moneys worth and would be caught by the SDRT coverage, but not by stamp duty. SDRT is moneys worth, not stamp duty. The company could take out its parcel of shares in paper and not be levied duty, whereas it could be if it takes them out electronically. We address that point. Clause 175 changes the legislation so that the½ per cent. of SDRT that would have been levied as a consequence of that transaction does not arise.<br><br>
The other aspect of stamp duty and SDRT that the hon. Lady mentioned was group relief, which is covered by clause 176. We need an anti-avoidance mechanism in that regard, to prevent one member of a group of companies, for example a market maker, acquiring shares from outside the group free of SDRT and then rapidly transferring it to other companies within the group without stamp duty arising. The way in which to address such avoidance is through SDRT. Therefore, the tax bites on transfer from the market makers to the first company to which they would transfer their shares. If the market makers hold on to the shares for a reasonable period—that is, for more than two years—they can transfer from company to company as one would normally do with group relief. If one company in a group of companies purchased shares and paid stamp duty or SDRT on them, it would be able to pass those shares within the group of companies with the benefit of group relief.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's final point related to depository receipts and clearance systems, which were brought in by the legislation that introduced SDRT. They continue, though in a slightly different way, as a consequence of the Bill. The variation is that although the 1½ per cent. remains for depository receipts, an alternative is provided for the clearance system. In future, a clearance system can either charge 1½ per
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 562</span>
cent. on shares that go into the clearance system and then have the transactions take place free of duty, or it will be able to elect, if it so wishes, to pay no charge as shares go into the clearance system but it then pays ½per cent. as the shares are transferred. The reason for having that option is that it is important for the City of London and will no doubt be taken up by many people as a consequence of the probable future increase in clearance systems. I hope that that has answered the hon. Lady's question.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. It is correct that we want to replace clause 177 with new clause 23. I shall explain the Government's reasons briefly.<br><br>
Clause 177 concerns the treatment for stamp duty reserve tax of stock lending arrangements made by the stock exchange market makers. Stock lending transactions in paper form are already covered by existing stamp duty reliefs but we have to address the stock exchange's new system.<br><br>
The reason for the new clause is twofold. As it stands, clause 177 sets out the reliefs for the stock lending and collateral security for SDRT to cater for the stock exchange market makers stock lending process through a CREST, which is slightly different from that which they operate today. I note the expression on your face, Mr. Hogg, but I assure you that I am trying to set out the issue in clear English, which is not easy. If we had some dominoes to move around, we might be able to visualise the process better.<br><br>
On the assumption that the stock lending goes via an intermediary who is the broker dealer, an additional relief had to be granted for the return of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 563</span>
stock to the lender. A stock lender thus goes to a broker dealer and passes on to a market maker with a stamp duty or SDRT relief. A consequential collateral must return to the stock lender, and stocks required relief on that.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The collateral returns to the stock lender so that he gets something in his sticky paw in return for the stock that he lent. A stock lender does not want to find that he is suddenly eligible to pay stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax on a transaction that should improve the market's liquidity. The hon. Gentleman might ask why that is so, but the only new aspect of the process is that it will in future be done in CREST. As soon as electronics are introduced, matters tend to become much more complicated.<br><br>
One step in clause 177 did not provide the appropriate relief. We could have changed it through amendments, but the stock exchange elected to change its rules after we had drafted the clause. It decided to allow stock lending to take place without an intermediary. The clause did not cater for SDRT relief on a direct lend from a stock lender to a market maker—it allowed for such relief only if there was an intermediary. We thus faced a choice between further, complex amendments or the more appropriate step of tabling a new clause to cover all eventualities. I hope that that is clearer than mud. That is why we want to replace clause 177 with new clause 23. Amendment No. 345 adds some words to the repeal so that, when stamp duty is finally abolished, the new clause will be mentioned in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To paraphrase the Economic Secretary, whereas Parliament usually makes the law and the stock exchange then changes its rules, the stock exchange has now changed its rules and we are obliging it by changing the law accordingly. The stock exchange has, furthermore, had the ill grace to change its rules after the parliamentary draftsmen drafted clause 177, which must now be withdrawn so that the rules comply with a law that we have not yet passed. Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the stock exchange could have chosen a better time to allow stock lending to take different forms. In its defence, it was responding to the Office of Fair Trading report.<br><br>
It may help members of the Committee if they consider letters P, Q and R. The transactions that are outlined in clause 177 and the new clause give the organisations or individuals concerned a letter. In effect, under clause 177 and the stock exchange's lending process, the stock lender is R, Q is the person in the middle, and P is the market maker. So, the stock went R-Q-P, P-Q-R and we have ensured that, within CREST, that happens without raising stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax as happens at the moment. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 564</span>
stock exchange decided that both Q and R were no longer needed, so one went from one of those to P and from P back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister explain what happens if the stock exchange has got it wrong and the CREST system does not operate properly even with the new clause? If the rules are not correctly changed, where will that leave Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to tell the Committee, Mrs. Hogg—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, Mr. Hogg. We are all getting confused, but that is one confusion too far.<br><br>
If CREST did not go ahead, the current system would continue to operate. Therefore, we would have the stock-lending process that we have now. On the other hand, if the stock exchange decided that it would not remove the requirement for a broker-dealer—the middle man, an intermediary—but would retain an individual who had to be part of the stock-lending process, the new clause covers that. If the stock exchange decided that, following the implementation of CREST, there would never again be any requirement for an intermediary, the clause covers that as well. Therefore, all rule-change eventualities are covered. It is quite right for the stock exchange to make its rules in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether you, Mr. Hogg, have read the letter in <i>The Times</i> today from Sir George Engle, a former first parliamentary counsel. He writes that the Treasury has been wasting public money by commissioning parts of the Finance Bill to be drafted by private firms. He claims that the cost of producing one page is £3,880. I suggest that, as the new clause has been prompted by the stock exchange and would not have been necessary had it got its act together, we should send it a bill for about £8,000 for the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An entertaining point, but I do not think that it is altogether in order. We can do many things in the Finance Bill, but we cannot send out bills. That is not within our powers and were I to do so, I would get into trouble with the Chairman of Ways and Means.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 177 disagreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clauses 178 to 182 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That further consideration be adjourned.—[<i>Dr. Liam Fox.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. It is not yet 6 o'clock. There is considerable time left and I do not see why we should rise at this point without some explanation of why we are doing so. There was considerable debate earlier about how sections of the Finance Bill have fallen completely into disrepute and we are now witnessing a clear sign
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0538">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 565</span>
of the state of chaos that exists on the Government Front Bench. We are entitled to an explanation before we allow the Government to pull the Committee well ahead of time, when there is plenty of time to continue consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been proposed that further consideration be adjourned. That allows the Committee to debate the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As was said earlier, the Government are in more than a little chaos with regard to certain parts of the Bill. That chaos has now been extended, because the Government are trying to short-circuit the Committee's ability to consider parts of the Bill. The purpose of the Committee is to examine the detail of the Bill within a reasonable time. We have always sat until 7 o'clock and have not tried to short-circuit our proceedings. We feel that that is a reasonable time to finish our debate, given that we have many points to make about the Bill as it stands.<br><br>
The Government are running scared: they are very worried that they have messed something up in the Bill. We would very much like to find out why. It is in the public's interest to find out why they have messed it up. Let us see whether we can get the Government to give us an explanation of why they have messed up parts of the Bill and why they are not prepared to allow debate to shed light on the matter. We are entitled to an explanation.<br><br>
Points of order had to be made this morning because the Government had tabled amendments at the last possible moment on a Friday afternoon of a non-sitting day. That was dealt with and I accept that it was in order, so I am not making that point again. But the Government are in chaos, they do not know what they are doing and they are in deep trouble with their amendments. I suspect that they were tabling amendments on loan relationships on a Friday morning not because they were being surreptitious but because they realised that they were going quickly through the Bill and were getting close to having to defend their proposals on loan relationships. No doubt that morning their lawyers were trying to draft a series of amendments as hurriedly as possible.<br><br>
I have good reason for believing that to be the case because today I talked to various representatives of the professional associations that were consulted by the Economic Secretary. They suggested to me that the Government are not as together and are not finding as much support on the amendments as they hoped, which is why they are trying to short-circuit debate. The Government are pretending that they are ready to deal with loan relationships but they are not. They said that the amendments have a certain dynamic and that they have support from various institutions. That is not the case.<br><br>
My point is directly relevant to the Government's attempt to short-circuit our debate. The Government are unable to proceed and are in some chaos. That is why the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) asked for the Committee to be adjourned early.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 566</span>
6 pm<br><br>
We are dealing with an enormously complex piece of legislation that the Government have been trying to put together since last May. Where have they got to? To a perfect mess. That is why they are trying to slow things down. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is a body of people who said that they needed a wet-towel job, as they put it, to work out what the Government are up to; I spoke to Mr. John Whiting, the chairman of its technical committee and a senior man at Price Waterhouse—one could not imagine a man better able to speak credibly about the way in which the Government are proceeding on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is enjoying himself and I always think that that is highly dangerous and not to be encouraged. Could he speak for or against the motion proposed by the Government Whip? That is what is before the Committee, not all those other matters to which the hon. Gentleman is referring eloquently but not relevantly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg, for that advice. We seek some explanation from the Government of why the hon. Member for Woodspring proposed that motion, which I oppose. If the Committee is to be adjourned more than an hour before we would normally adjourn, surely we have a right to an explanation. I am trying to give the Government a hint about why they want to adjourn the Committee so early.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am addressing Mr. Hogg who is about to cut me short at the legs. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know who is shouting, "Order", but as I have already explained, I am rather good at shouting that and am the only person who gets to do so. The hon. Gentleman is being asked to give way which he could reasonably do; it is a matter for him, but the hon. Member for Beaconsfield may—who knows—be able to enlighten him on the Government's thinking on the matter. At some point we shall have to reach a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You may well be right, Mr. Hogg, and I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman so that we can have an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that we consider the loans relationship legislation this afternoon when, as he said, it was published only on Friday? Would that be sensible? Is he aware that the CBI and the British Bankers Association are spending the whole of today considering the details of that legislation so that when we get to it on Thursday we shall have some information on their views? Both those organisations want the legislation implemented as soon as possible, on 1 April.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to have admitted that the Government are in a mess on loan
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0539">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 567</span>
relationships, although we have not got to that subject yet. That is why we have been asked to adjourn so early—the Government must allow bodies to consult further on their 166 amendments to 25 clauses. I do not know because I have not had the opportunity to explore the matter, but that is probably an unprecedented number of amendments and an unprecedented recasting of the major part of a Finance Bill. It is clear, Mr. Hill—I mean Mr. Hogg—that the Government are in a mess and that if we are not careful the Committee may also get into a mess.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am in danger of developing an identity crisis, this afternoon, which I am trying hard to avoid. Will the hon. Gentleman return to his seat for a moment? He has had a good run and, as I said earlier, appears to be enjoying himself. Moreover, a Conservative Back-Bench Member—the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—has provided an explanation of the reasoning behind the motion for an Adjournment. He may have gleaned that information from a usually reliable source.<br><br>
It is not for me to decide whether to have an Adjournment motion. That is discussed in the usual channels. Shortly after the Attlee Government, I was the Opposition Chief Whip, working together with the then Government Whip. We used to come to reasonable agreements and I hope that that will be the style of the Opposition Whip. I am sure that he has discussed the matter with the Government Whip. I hope that they understand where we are in the Bill's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take too much of the Committee's time, but a serious mater is exposed here. If we had clear signs from the Government—not a Back Bencher—as to why we need to pull this Committee early, Committee members would be happy and we would all leave in a decent frame of mind.<br><br>
There was an important debate in the House yesterday about Ministers' responsibility to be honest and fully open with Parliament about why decisions are taken. Yet in this Committee, a section of the Bill has been completely rewritten through more than 100 amendments, which have been tabled with virtually no time properly to consider them. The Bill is in deep trouble and we must make that clear. If the Government acknowledged that such trouble was the reason why we could not proceed, we would be happy to adjourn. But, if they are not prepared to admit that there is a massive problem over parliamentary accountability with respect to the Bill, it is not surprising that Opposition Members are worried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am looking forward to hearing the Government's explanation. I wonder whether they should consult the Chief Secretary. He is supposed to be the senior Government Front Bencher, but where is he?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me see if I can shed light on these arcane proceedings. You rightly drew our attention,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 568</span>
Mr. Hogg, to the fact that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire wanted to have his fun. My hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring made a proper suggestion for the Committee to adjourn in simple recognition of the fact that our business had been transacted. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary provided the Committee with information this morning because she was anxious for further details to be made available to the Opposition as soon as possible to facilitate proper debate of the outstanding clauses.<br><br>
If the Opposition had been derelict in their duties of probing stamp duty further, it would have been right for my hon. Friend to suggest that the time had come to cease debate. The Government Whip, has provided the Committee with clear reasons for his proposal. It is an entirely responsible decision to facilitate higher quality debate when we resume later this week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I make it in an attempt to be helpful. At the top of the amendment paper is listed the Committee's decision on the order in which we will consider the Bill. It is clear from what we have heard that the Government are not yet in a position to advance the arguments in favour of the 160 amendments on loan relationships that have been put before the Committee.<br><br>
My question for you, Mr. Hogg, is whether it would be in order for the Government, perhaps through their Whip, the hon. Member for Woodspring, to propose an amendment to the Committee's order of consideration, which would acknowledge the fact that the Government have got into difficulty with their amendments on loan relationships. If they sought to defer discussion on that until later on in our proceedings, they could consult the professional bodies and the CBI and obtain their reaction to the amendments, which have been tabled very late. That would also enable Opposition Members to take advice from professional experts so that we can do our job properly and probe the Government's proposed legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I might reply to the point of order and perhaps the hon. Member for North Warwickshire might not then have a further point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York is correct; the Government could indeed do what he suggested. However, whether they elect to do that is entirely a matter for the Government and not for the Chair. They have heard what the hon. Gentleman said. It would be in order to re-arrange the business if the Government felt that that was appropriate and tabled an appropriate amendment to the order of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have no doubt that were the Government to canvass, through the usual channels, such a proposal for the benefit and smooth running of the Committee, we would be anxious to be as accommodating as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 569</span>
possible over the Government's obvious difficulties with the amendments. We have had an explanation from the Financial Secretary, as we requested, and I think that we can all read between the lines. On that basis, I will make no further points.</span></p>
