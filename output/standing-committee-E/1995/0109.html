	<div class='page-header'><h1>Health Service Commissioners (Amendment) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Clauses 2 and 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 1 agreed to.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EXERCISE OF CLINICAL JUDGMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 4, line 43, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>and insert "the course of
	<ol>
	<li>the diagnosis of illness, or</li>
	<li>the care or treatment of a patient".</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 10, in page 4, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In section 11 of the 1993 Act (procedure in respect of investigations) there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>`(7) The Secretary of State may by regulations made by statutory instrument make provision for the conduct by a Commissioner of any investigation in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment.'.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause lies at the heart of the Bill; on its proper definitions and practices, the success of the measure will depend. There are three amendments to the clause, the first two of which are to be discussed now. Amendment No. 9 deals with the definition of clinical judgment and inserts the words of the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993 into the Bill. There is no definition in the Bill. Amendment No. 10 gives the Secretary of State the power to enable the commissioner to conduct an investigation following the exercise of clinical judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Bill exists largely to deal with complaints—that is quite right and proper. I consider it to have an additional function: to improve the standard of clinical judgment and practice in the national health service. The effect that the procedures could have on that necessary function of those involved has been underestimated. If the Bill is to fulfil that additional role, it must be held in esteem and respected by those who will be subject to its provisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take doctors as an example of workers in the national health service, there are three procedures under which clinical judgment can be challenged. The first is through normal stage 1 and stage 2 within the NHS—I consider that the legislation extends that to the ombudsman—the second is through the General Medical Council and the third through the courts. Similarly with the General Medical Council, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
charge of serious professional misconduct—or the new charge in the Bill—is not related to individual items of misjudgment in clinical matters, which is what the ombudsman is concerned with. It is important, therefore, that those three areas continue to be kept separate and that that is clearly laid down in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to who is to make the decision, it is again important that we get it right. The ombudsman, has agreed that he will not necessarily make it; he will have medical advisers who will decide in the wings. I am sure that his judgment will be correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further question arises: will the person whose clinical judgment has been called into question have a say in who the advisers are and will he or she be able to appoint an adviser? We must not forget that such a process challenges the fundamentals of that person's clinical standards and profession. We are not challenging the process in cases of serious professional misconduct, because the person has access to a democratic process of redress, nor in cases that have gone to court, where the person can bring evidence. We are challenging an instance where an individual makes a charge that is based on various pieces of evidence. Again, that process must be clearly set out via a statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that each of those procedures be maintained entirely separately. I do not like the suggestion that has already been made by the ombudsman that he might make judgments about how best such matters should be pursued. The procedures perform separate functions and that is why amendment No. 10 was tabled; so that the procedures are laid down by Parliament to ensure that they are followed. In a paper at the end of the year, the ombudsman proposed that he might not pursue a case if he thought that a separate channel, such as the courts, might be the correct one to follow, Such a decision is not within the ombudsman's judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the possibilities. If a case goes through the courts, it is considered a judgment against a case of negligence. It might be that no negligence was involved, but that an error of clinical judgment occurred. In other words, a case could fail in court, but could be found in the complainant's favour by the ombudsman. Therefore, it is not right for the ombudsman immediately to abrogate his responsibility to a court where the test of what went wrong is much higher than it is within his domain at that stage. The ombudsman should not be allowed the power to make a decision about whether there is a more appropriate arena in which a case could be judged. He must consider the cases on their own. It is for individuals and their advisers to decide whether to take the case to court separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also know what levels of judgment are to be considered. In other words, will the ombudsman judge a registrar case separate from a consultant's? From his recent paper, the answer is that he probably will. However, I hope that the ombudsman will not think that because a registrar may have made an incorrect judgment, he is not able to say that perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
someone other than the registrar should have made the judgment, thus allocating some responsibility to that other person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman's paper tells us that he will consider judgments differently in the light of whether they concern, for example, a district general hospital or a teaching hospital. I hope that that is not the case in this instance; that is one of the reasons we want Parliament to scrutinise the matter. There may well be different judgments, but the ombudsman must also decide whether it might have been more appropriate for the patient to be managed in a teaching hospital rather than in a district general hospital. It is not that different standards cannot be applied to different types of hospitals, but in deciding matters of clinical judgment, he must look up and down the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All such issues are important and need further airing. They must be brought before the House via a statutory instrument before we make our final decision. I want the ombudsman to stick to the NHS complaints procedure, which is fairly straightforward. If he does not and thinks that he can pass off decisions to the various courts, he will deny many patients and individuals what they want: someone to decide whether a misjudgment has been made and if so, to whom to apportion blame. We cannot allow the ombudsman to push that responsibility on to side courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also be clear about what the ombudsman can investigate in the NHS. He said that he would not normally investigate complaints that had not been through the NHS procedure. If he will not do so normally, on what occasions will he perform such investigations? What is the definition of normal in the paper? What cases will he examine even when they have not been through NHS procedure? Such issues require further clarification, because they are the nub of the Bill and essential for getting it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Horam)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that I appreciate the intention of his amendment. Indeed, he seeks, helpfully, to clarify the future position of the health service commissioner when people use the wide range of opportunities—as they do now—to challenge clinical judgment and negligence. He rightly noted that a person can pursue a complaint down three avenues. First, he can use parts one and two of the complaints procedure that we shall put in place. Those are not the subject of the Bill, but they are part of the package. Secondly, he can approach the General Medical Council. Thirdly, there are the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with amendment No. 10, to which the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden addressed most of his remarks. The amendment would set out statutory regulations on the health service commissioner's approach to complaints. Two issues are involved here. First, the commissioner is a servant of Parliament and reports to it. He is overseen by the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, which is an independent body and
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
part of Parliamentary procedures. He is not responsible to the Government and it is critical that he maintains that independence. I want to introduce as little statutory regulation as possible into the Bill and to preserve the HSC's total independence. That is the right starting point and I am reluctant to prescribe the commissioner's actions in specific circumstances. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands that it is wrong for the Government to establish too many statutory regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is concerned about the link between a possible court case for negligence and the health service Commissioner's role. The Bill goes almost all the way towards meeting those concerns. While a court case is in progress, the commissioner will have to refrain from considering it. Once the case is over, however, he will be able to reopen it, if he considers that clinical misjudgment may be involved. He will be able to examine the case, regardless of whether negligence and damages were involved and regardless of what decisions were taken. He can step in and out of the process without any prejudice or hindrance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and have some sympathy with his argument. I also listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Minister's reply and I am concerned that some people will not be covered by the procedures that he describes. In some cases, people cannot go to law because they cannot afford doctors' reports and X-rays and are not eligible for legal aid. They cannot, therefore, prove negligence or clinical misjudgment. I hope that the Bill, will help such people, even if the health service commissioner does not deal fully with cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People tend to close ranks and it is almost impossible to get anything through the GMC lay committee. One of its lay members wrote to me 18 months ago—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a rather long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, she—the lay member—said that it was impossible to get anything through the lay committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but the Bill completely answers her concerns. If there is no court case, the commissioner's role is uncontested. He can examine whatever he wants to as long as, in cases of maladministration or clinical judgment, he takes the view outlined in the paper. If there is no court case, he is not hindered in the way in which he can tackle a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the commissioner's paper suggests that he would be able to decide whether recourse to the courts would be more appropriate, but that should not be for him to decide. The commissioner cannot decide about a case without hearing evidence from both sides, which takes a long time. He cannot prejudge the matter. The commissioner must decide whether a mistake has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
made—that is not the same as deciding about negligence. It would be wrong for him to push such matters into the courts. People want their cases to be examined and blame to be apportioned if a mistake has been made. They only go to court as a last resort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment is essentially unnecessary. The Bill provides that the health service commissioner will have the right to examine cases such as those the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) described. A complainant may decide to take a case to court. In that event, the health service commissioner will, in effect, be forced to step aside. However, he can take the case up again if the complainant fails, or decides that the court's judgment is unsatisfactory. So there is no hindrance to the commissioner acting in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the Bill is to ensure that there is less litigation because the health service commissioner will be able to exercise his judgment on clinical matters. People who cannot afford it will not be required to take action through the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the problem. My next amendment deals with people who independently pursue court cases. This amendment deals with people who, having approached the ombudsman, are then told that he or she will not investigate a case and that they should take the matter through the courts. The ombudsman should not have that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does not have that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ombudsman said in his paper that that might be something that he might consider. But the court test of negligence is separate from his test of whether there has been a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entirely right. The health service commissioner will not be able to say whether a matter should go before the court. The positions of the court and of the health service commissioner are separate. The Bill ensures that the two are not mixed up. There must be clarity about that. I understand the hon. Gentleman's reasoning, but the effect of his amendment is achieved by the Bill, so the amendment is unnecessary and, I ought to add, probably wrong in principle. I have already set out why there should not be too many statutory limitations on the commissioner's actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 amplifies what is meant by the term "clinical judgment". The danger is that the insertion of extra words into the Bill would tend to restrict rather than amplify such usage. The words "clinical judgment" are well understood, certainly by the health service commissioner. As I said on Second Reading, they refer to matters decided by the qualifications and experience of a clinician, which cannot be decided by other people. The position is therefore left open, and the health service commissioner can decide what he wants under that heading. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Bearsden is pushing at an open door with amendment No. 9. The words "clinical judgment" are sufficient in law to achieve the end that he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording in amendment No. 9 is the exact wording used in the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993, which excluded the commissioner from considering clinical judgments. All we are trying to do is to include those words in the Bill, so that we know what is meant by "clinical judgment". Those words defined what the commissioner could not consider under the 1993 Act. What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 9 would remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"consequence of the exercise of clincal judgment".</p></blockquote>
The problem is that the concept of maladministration, with which the clause deals, is not legally relevant to clinical judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words in the amendment were used in the 1993 Act to show what the commissioner was excluded from considering in law. On Second Reading, one of the Minister's hon. Friends said that we needed a definition of "clinical judgment". We are merely trying to include in the Bill the definition of "clinical judgment" used in the 1993 Act. It is ridiculous to say that we cannot do so. People should know exactly what we mean when we say that the commissioner can now consider clinical judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be misunderstanding the point of the clause, which is to bring the consideration of clinical judgments within the remit of the health service commissioner. To exclude that is rather bizarre. I do not understand the point of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. This is an appropriate way to include within the commissioner's remit the ability to consider any clinical judgment. I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman wants to remove that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are saying that, under the 1993 Act, the Government did not leave it up to the commissioner to decide what "clinical judgment" meant. That Act gave a clear description of what it meant so that the commissioner could not consider it. We thought that it would be better to resurrect the words in the 1993 Act and include them in the Bill, now that the commissioner can consider clinical judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fail to understand the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was excluded in the 1993 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the 1993 Act did not deal with clinical judgment per se; it excluded clinical judgment. I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman that it is our legal opinion that what is in the Bill is sufficient to do what he and I both want. We do not need the extra words that he wants to include. Let us be economical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Anderson.

	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
Will the Minister put on the record that clinical judgment includes the diagnosis of an illness and the care or treatment of a patient? That may be helpful when the commissioner has decided not to take up a case involving a clinical judgment and people involved read the report of our debates. If that is not stated in the Bill, the Minister must clearly state somewhere what, in his opinion, clinical judgment represents. Does he accept that the words in the amendment go some way to providing a definition of "clinical judgment" and will he say how that will be defined by the commissioner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can say that the term "clinical judgment" includes the points raised in the amendment. I hope that that helps to clarify the matter. Clearly that must so, because clinical judgment, unfettered by any other definition, automatically includes diagnosis of illness and so forth. That is certainly correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be involved in this legislation because I remember vividly the case of one of my constituents who went into hospital to have a small lump removed from the top of his head. It was in the days before procedures were explained and patients were told what was going to happen to them. They are now, which is welcome. During the operation, when surgeons opened up the man's head, they discovered that the condition was more serious than they had initially thought. They used an injection to kill what they believed to be the underlying growth, but the needle went through his eye, which he lost as a result of the operation. Those who carried out the operation used their best clinical judgment and were horrified at the outcome. They were sure that some form of compensation would be available to him but, of course, it was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, the only way one could claim compensation was to prove negligence, but the surgeons had not been negligent. They had used their clinical judgment to establish what was best for the patient. My constituent lost an eye and was never compensated for it. My understanding is that my constituent could have complained to the ombudsman, had the operation been performed subsequent to this Bill. Clinical judgment could have been questioned in that a different medical opinion might have suggested that the injection was a risk. The ombudsman might therefore have found—without condemnation of the doctors who used their best knowledge—that what happened, in causing the loss of an eye, was wrong. I always feel a great sense of injustice whenever I think about my constituent, because no remedy was available to compensate him for what he suffered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I understand my hon Friend's point. That sort of example is a cause of great concern in the health service. In the end, however, even though hardship and injustice may arise from a clinical decision, if it is taken in good faith and to adequate professional standards, it is difficult to blame the
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
profession for the problem. One cannot prejudge what view the health service commissioner would take of the case he raised. He could certainly consider it and, in the course of investigating it, might find that, in the light of professional advice, the doctors did not adhere to set professional standards. It could well be that they made a mistake. The man lost an eye, so hardship was clearly involved and the ombudsman could deliver a verdict in favour of my hon. Friend's constituent. However, my hon. Friend will be aware that it is not normal for compensation to be made as a result of a health service commissioner's verdict. The ombudsman will relate clearly what happened and give his view as to what the remedy should be. In some cases, compensation might be made available on the recommendation of the commissioner, but only in rare circumstances. Equally, the ombudsman might decide otherwise and find that the surgeon's decision was made in good faith and according to acceptable professional standards. In that case, nothing could be done to help the complainant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the Bill opens an additional avenue in dealing with cases of the sort described by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Sir J. Lester). Where it is unclear a priori whether a mistake has been made or whether professionals standards were adhered to, the case can be investigated. That is the point of the Bill. It provides an extra route for a complainant to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his replies. The two comments made by Conservative Members highlight some of the confusion that still exists about how complaints should be dealt with. It is important for Parliament to lay down additional guidelines on this difficult matter so that the ombudsman is clear about the remit within which he is working. There is a difference between negligence, serious professional misconduct, a mistake and a bad outcome. We must be clear about these differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's point. Like him, I wish to limit the amount of legislation and regulation, not only for the ombudsman but more widely. The issue is getting the balance right, but I am not sure that we yet have it right. The issues are wide and I am not convinced that we have fully debated them. I should like more time to consider the ombudsman's paper, which raises some fundamental points that contradict some of the arguments suggested by the Minister. We would like to return to these issues on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 4, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) In section 11 of the 1993 Act (procedure in respect of investigations) there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>`(7) Where it appears to a Commissioner that any investigation in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgement may prejudice any forthcoming trial, whether criminal or civil, he shall discontinue that investigation, but

he shall have power to continue that investigation again if he becomes satisfied that the risk of prejudice no longer exists.'.".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is related to but not the same as, the previous one. The Minister believes that the issue it raises is adequately covered in the Bill, so I should be grateful if he would reassure me on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explain why the amendment does not cover the same issue as before. One of the issues raised previously was whether the ombudsman should have the right to say that a case should not be investigated by him, but pursued in the courts. My argument is that the ombudsman should not have that right, for he cannot make a judgment about negligence without having all the facts of the case. That is not the issue that this amendment raises, however. It relates to a case in which someone is already pursuing, or proposing to pursue, a matter through the courts and to whether the ombudsman should have the right to halt proeedings at that stage. If a case is being pursued through the courts, I am sure that we would all agree that no one should be put in double jeopardy by having it further investigated. If the issue is already covered by the Bill, I would be grateful for the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary because the circumstances that he mentioned are adequately covered by the Bill. It is not, of course, up to the health service commissioner to decide about negligence. That is a legal matter that must be decided by the courts. He can take cases as far as he can, even though they may also be subject to a court's decision. If the complainant is advised to take the matter to court, the ombudsman must cease to investigate it, but whatever the result of the court case, he can later reconsider whether clinical misjudgment was involved. Essentially, therefore, the amendment is unnecessary because it is already covered in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister a couple of questions about the involvement of the health service commissioner in awards and compensation? There may be occasions on which he finds grounds for the recommendation that clinical misjudgment—though not necessarily negligence—is involved and that an award should be actively considered to compensate a patient. However, the provider or the trust might decide that it does not want to make an award of the amount suggested or might even refuse point blank to award anything. In those circumstances, what do the patient's options amount to? Could he go to a county court on the basis of the commissioner's judgment, or would he have to go through the normal procedure of taking the matter to court and having another full examination of the evidence? Will the Minister clarify what amounts to a key issue? Will the commissioner's judgment be accepted by all the parties to the complaints procedure? In some cases it may not be, so what redress would a patient then have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be clear about the relative roles of the courts and the health service commissioner. If, on advice, a complainant feels that there are grounds for compensation as a result of
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
negligence, in the first instance he should go to the courts. That is the appropriate remedy. The health service commissioner can only give his view that there has been some clinical misjudgment. That is his role and, in the past, even when considering the questions of maladministration that have been his sole remit so far, he has generally not gone into matters of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service commissioner can say that the clinical decisions made in a particular case were unreasonable in the light of adequate professional standards. His view is a matter of public record and is given to the complainant, the Secretary of State, the provider and the purchaser involved, and so on. That much is in the public domain, but the matter becomes one for the court to determine if an individual decides to take it that far. The health service commissioner's views cannot necessarily be quoted in court, nor can he be brought to court to give his view. The traditional remit of the health service commissioner has always been understood to be separate from any legal action that may be taken. The Bill preserves that separation. If people feel that compensation is in order, they may take court action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply worries me because it implies that, if the commissioner's investigation finds that a patient should be recompensed in some way, the commissioner has no power to enforce the payment of that compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also correct the Minister's contention that the health service commissioner does not normally recommend compensation. For example, the commissioner asked my local health trust to consider making a compensatory payment to one of my constituents, but the trust decided not to make any such payment. There was also the Leeds incident, in which a person was transferred from national health service care into a private nursing home without due consideration. In that case, the health service commissioner recommended that compensation be paid to the family and to the individual involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner has already set precedents for recommending the payment of compensatory awards in cases of maladministration, but what can patients do if the provider refuses to comply with such a recommendation? The convention is that people tend to accept an ombudsman's report: if the provider rejects a recommendation, what can patients involved do apart from going to court?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many patients may decide not to go to court, either because the matter is not deemed sufficiently serious or because legal aid is not forthcoming and it is difficult for borderline families to justify spending the money required to pursue a case for compensation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, people want basic justice and, if necessary, the apportionment of blame. They do not necessarily want compensation. If the health service commissioner believes a case is serious enough to warrant compensation, but the health authority or trust refuses to give it, what can patients do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the Health Service Commissioners (Amendment) Bill. It amends, but does not extend, existing provisions for the health service commissioner's remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger), I must make it clear that I did not say that no compensation had ever been offered by the health service commissioner. I said that it was rare for compensation to be offered. The hon. Gentleman highlighted two cases—the Leeds incident is well known and he mentioned the other on Second Reading—in which it was recommended that compensation be made. That may happen on odd occasions, although it is the exception rather than the rule. Given the roles of the health service commissioner and of the PCA Select Committee since its inception, however, the options as to what can be done are extremely limited when a provider refuses to comply with a recommendation from the commissioner that compensation be made. The PCA Select Committee could take up the matter if a complaint was made against a Government body, or whatever it may be, and was upheld by the health service commissioner. The Select Committee could highlight the fact that the ombudsman's judgment had been flouted by the body in question. As hon. Members will understand, however, especially those on the PCA Select Committee, there is a limit to the powers of the commissioner, whether the parliamentary commissioner or the health service commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner can go only so far. He can take the matter up with the PCA Select Committee or make a special report reviewing what has happened—he can deliver a verdict and allow a cerain amount of time to elapse before reviewing what course of action has been taken by the organisation against which the complaint was made. The commissioner can point out in that second report that the organisation has not responded to his views, but that is as far as he can go. We do not want to add anything more radical to that role in the Bill. There is a limit that we must accept if we want to stay within what have traditionally been regarded as the lines of conduct of the health service commissioner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) raised an interesting and important point. The Minister's answer to my next question will be important when people examine the Committee's proceedings. Hitherto, it mattered perhaps not greatly that the commissioner was unable to enforce remedies. The culture was that what the ombudsman said went. At the end of the day, that might have produced some red faces among managers who were charged with maladministration; they wriggled a bit, but, especially with the Select Committee in reserve, they tended to go along with the recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Bill takes the activities and the jurisdiction of the commissioner into quite different waters where litigation sits at the side and where awards are made in comparable cases. By introducing the Bill and providing the health service commissioner with new powers, do the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
expect the ombudsman routinely to make recommendations about compensatory payments in cases where he finds that clinical misjudgment has taken place? If that is the case, would the Government expect those payments to be broadly in line with payments that would be made by the courts for exactly comparable cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. As he said, it is important to note that, by bringing clinical judgment into the ambit of the health service commissioner, we are entering new territory where the law stands beside a situation—I think that those were the hon. Gentleman's words; they are good words. In many previous court cases, considerable sums have been granted as compensation for clinical negligence. But in this instance, we are simply putting the new element into the picture. We cannot prejudge what view the commissioner will take on the matter. I will not at all happily follow the line argued for by the hon. Gentleman that the commissioner should automatically recommend compensation or—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Govenment can have an opinion simply because we are discussing the health service commissioner. I do not want to prejudge the views of the health service commissioner in anything I say in Committee or elsewhere. He is independant and reports to a Committee of the House. He must be allowed to make up his own mind about how to pursue questions of clinical judgment. I hope that that principle is plain, and I recommend it to the hon. Gentleman. It would be a mistake to derogate from it because that would undermine the ambitions behind the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert specific terms into clause 6 and refers to a case
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears to a Commissioner that any investigation in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment may prejudice any forthcoming trial".</p></blockquote>
I have carefully read the health service commissioner's notes. In the section entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Remedies in the Courts or at a Tribunal"</p></blockquote>
the commissioner sets out his thoughts on some of the issues that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to get my head round what the Minister envisages. In one case, the complainant may take a scatter-gun approach and see his Member of Parliament, a lawyer and the commissioner. He may consider the case from many angles. If he seeks a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
remedy in the courts, the commissioner will presumably tell him that he must stand aside. How will the commissioner communicate that to the complainant? Will he simply say that the courts offer the complainant a remedy? Will the way in which that is expressed to him therefore be critical?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the other end of the spectrum are cases in which the complainant goes to the ombudsman and, as a result of the ombudsman's inquiries, subsequently decides that his best course of action is to take the case to court. How will such cases be dealt with? Might not the courts interpret the time that the commissioner takes to deal with the matter to the clinician's detriment? Such practical issues must be addressed before we can accept the Minister's assurance that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asked how, if the complainant goes to court, the commissioner will communicate to him that he will cease to consider the case. The commissioner will simply stop his investigation. In the reverse case, a complainant who receives the commissioner's judgment and then decides that it is worth taking his case to court has every right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should make it clear that going to the health service commissioner cannot be a substitute for claiming damages in court. The two procedures are entirely different. As the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said before Christmas, many people do not really seek compensation, although it may be given, but a proper explanation for what has happened, an apology, if it is in order, and some assurance that if a mistake has been found, it will be learnt from and will not happen again, at least in that institution. That issue, which particularly concerns people, is addressed by the Bill. We cannot overload the commissioner with responsibility and let him consider an area that is still strictly a matter for legal proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the ombudsman does not move into the area of compensation. That would involve lawyers, judgments, precedents and, having opened the floodgates, we would be no further forward. The Bill was intended to ensure that such matters were sorted out quickly, outside the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, I am not sure that the Bill contains the power he talked about, although perhaps it does informally. As I have said, however, topics such as the relationship of the ombudsman to the courts and to the General Medical Council, how judgments about clinical matters will be made and by whom, and when the ombudsman will or will not pursue cases that have not previously been through the NHS procedure will all bear fruitful discussion on Report and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal College of General Practitioners has sent a letter to all members of the Committee which was written by Dr. Bill Reith, the honourary secretary. While the college welcomes the inclusion of GPs' services in the powers of the health service commissioner, it is worried that the ombudsman would not seek peer group advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the ombudsman takes consultations, will he refer to peer group GPs, who could give him the best views and interpretations of events, as against the possibly inappropriate advice of a hospital consultant or specialist, who clearly does not have the day-to-day experience of a GP? It would be very unfair—contrary to natural justice, frankly—if GPs should find themselves being judged, in effect, by someone outside their immediate profession. I hope that the Minister will clarify that and thus send a reassuring message to the Royal College of General Practitioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes I wonder why I get up to speak. I thought that my earlier amendments had raised the point that different levels of judgment must be made by the ombudsman. That applies to GPs as well, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland). I want to clarify that matter by means of statutory instruments. Although there must be different levels of judgment, I want the ombudsman to be able to comment that, even when the person making a particular judgment is deemed not to have made a mistake, it was a mistake for that person rather than somebody else to have made it. Perhaps we will return to that point on Report, as a fuller discussion is obviously needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's rather subsidiary point. I thought that we had dealt with the main point and I agree that he encompassed the issue of the right level of clinical judgment in what he said earlier. I take the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam that that level of judgment has been a matter of concern. She mentioned the letter from the Royal College of General Practitioners. We are grateful for its support for the extension of the jurisdiction of the health service commissioner to cover family practice and service and for the positive spirit in which it has approached this matter. I am sure that my hon. Friend shares my sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed about the level of clinical judgment involved and whether people other than general practitioners should consider clinical judgments made by GPs. For example, should specialists be let loose on matters involving areas convered by GPs?

I wrote to Dr. Reith yesterday saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are approaching this Bill very much on the basis of preserving the Ombudsman's current discretion and his complete independence of Government as to how he goes about exercising his jurisdiction. We have, however, of course been in consultation with him about how he proposes to approach the extended jurisdiction which the Bill would given him, and I understand that he has had discussions with the professional bodies abut this as

	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
well. I think you will have seen a copy of his paper, the 	<i>Responsibilities of the Health Service Commissioner</i> which sets out in detail what his thinking is."</p></blockquote>
That is the point. I wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In his paper, the Ombusman sets out general principles which he will follow in obtaining professional advice. He envisages holding further discussions to set up the necessary arrangements"—</p></blockquote>
so he has not, as yet, fully finalised the way he will seek advice—
	<br><blockquote><p>"He also makes it clear that he will need to recruit to his Office medical staff to advise him on complaints relating to hospital specialties and, separately"—</p></blockquote>
I put the word "separately" in bold—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on general medical services. Thus the Commissioner makes it quite clear that he will draw on separate and appropriate advice for general medical services."</p></blockquote>
There is already a clear distinction in his mind between specialties and general practice and he will take appropriate medical advice in those two cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the commissioner has taken this point fully on board and so have we. I have written to him along those lines. He will also read the report of this debate and be aware that hon.

As we understand the current position, stages 1 and 2 of the complaints procedure will be considered by the House later in a statutory instrument. As a consequence, the Committee is unable to look at the full picture. However, what is made clear in the enclosures that we have received and by the debate is that for stage 2 of the procedure, which is crucial, the panel will be convened by a non-executive director of the particular trust or body involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that a complaints procedure should be independent and that it should be seen to be so. We are not convinced that stage 2 of the complaints procedure under this Bill will have the independence that it requires. Fairness can be guaranteed only if the procedure on which the commissioner in general relies is independent of the person or body against whom a complaint is lodged. Amendment No. 12 would
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
enshrine such independence in primary legislation by making it a requirement of the procedure under which cases are referred to the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the system's independence can be monitored most effectively by the community health councils in England and Wales and by the local health councils in Scotland. I understand that the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales has called on the Minister for more independence to be built into the complaints system. Those councils are well placed to vouch for the independence of the stage 2 complaints procedure. Local groups interested in health care issues recognise them as being separate from and independent of both the hospital trusts and the primary health care providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is likely that a procedure supported by the community health councils in England and Wales or the local health councils in Scotland would be acceptable to most patients. All Members of Parliament know that those councils have a certain independence. Sometimes we rely on them for advice in relation to our constituents' cases. It would be a good test of the complaints procedure if stage 2 could be given the necessary independence through the introduction of those councils into the system. That is the aim of amendment No. 12. I hope that the Minister agrees that the amendment would improve the Bill and that he will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. We must take a clear view of the independence of the second stage of what is a three-stage procedure. The matter needs to be explained carefully to prevent misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the convenor—the person who calls for an investigation—is a non-executive member of the trust. The hon. Gentleman argued that, by definition, the trust is the body being complained about, and he asked why a non-executive member of that trust should be the person who instigates the local review. I can tell him that the non-executive status of the convenor is important, in that the role of non-executive members of trusts is to see that the trust meets the expectations of the people whom it serves. Non-executive members have an overview of the performance of the trust as a whole, and so are clearly the right people to convene such a review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Non-executive trust members also have a responsibility to see that services are properly provided, and for that reason too they are the appropriate people to convene a review. However, the. hon. Gentleman did not state, as he should have done, that the review is a three-man operation. The convenor has to take advice from an independent person—who may be the chairman of the local review—as to whether a review should take place. It is not his decision alone. The convenor's first step is to take that independent advice: he cannot simply say, because he is a non-executive member of the trust and wants to hush matters up, that no review will take place. He
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>***
must consult an independent person before taking the decision. A second independent voice must be brought into play at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a panel is set up, it will comprise three people, two of whom will be independent of and not members of the trust. To that extent, there is a 2:1 majority for people who are not members of the trust, so the independence of the review will be guaranteed. Overall, therefore, the arrangements that we are setting up will have an acceptable degree of independence. Nothing can be whitewashed or hushed up under them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second element of the amendment relates to community health councils. Arrangements must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"acceptable to, in England or Wales, the relevant Community Health Council or, in Scotland, the Local Health Council."</p></blockquote>
The problem relates to the word "acceptable". At present, community health councils perform an important role when consulted on matters arising within their areas and on decisions made by the purchaser or provider. That is an important role, which we all value. The body sits on behalf of local citizens, judging whether decisions made by the purchaser or provider are right, and makes its comments public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However valuable the role of the community health councils, it is a consultative one. At no stage in the procedure do decisions made by a health authority or trust have to be acceptable to community health councils. It is not compulsory for providers to agree with community health councils. If the procedure was a non-consultative exercise in which community health council judgments had to be accepted those councils would be placed in too strong a position, very different from their traditional role. They are not set up for that more extensive role, which goes beyond what is reasonable under the complaints procedure that we are trying to establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right for the hon. Gentleman to consider stages 1 and 2 of the complaints procedure—operating from 1 April—but this Bill is not about those stages. It is solely about stage 3, which relates the to role of the health service commissioner. It is inappropriate for us to deal with matters that are not considered in the main body of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I accept that the role of non-executives on trust boards is indeed to ensure that services are properly provided. I do not want to detract from that in any way. However, we are dealing with a complaints procedure rather than a general view about what is happening within a particular trust. Will all three members of a board have a completely open view in relation to the specific complaint and the specific complainant? How will the board be perceived by complainants? That is the key issue. The panel will seem to have been put in place effectively by the body against which the complaint has been made. The amendment relates to an issue of genuine
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
independence because I do not believe that such independence will be secured under the panel at stage 2 as currently envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Bill is not specifically about stage 2. My understanding of the Minister's comments is that we are going to have a debate over a statutory instrument and nothing else. We cannot, however, amend that statutory instrument and we cannot establish the independence that we believe, as legislators, should be embodied in the Bill. When it comes to stages 1 and 2, we are faced with a fait accompli. The stages could be rejected, but I do not think that we would want to do that. As was said at the beginning of proceedings, we accept that the Bill and the issues which follow stages 1 and 2 will be helpful. We want to be helpful too, but a statutory instrument does not give us the right to probe, to find out and to build on independence that we think exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is right that the clause should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"acceptable to…the relevant Community Health Council"</p></blockquote>
because councils have local confidence. They might not have any statutory role, but that does not mean that they could not have. If they have the confidence of local people in terms of how health care is provided, they are the bodies to which people will go for advice about how they have been treated in the health service. Under those circumstances, it seems natural that we consider the councils as the body to provide an independent test of whether a complaints procedure is acceptable to the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test must be seen to be independent and we genuinely believe that the community health councils in England and Wales and the local health councils in Scotland are the bodies that should make the independent test. It should not be perceived that independence is convened by someone who works in the body against which a complaint has been made. That would lead to a loss of confidence in the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we are legislating just a few years after we last legislated on the same subject—in 1993—it is vital that we get it right. We should not have to consider the issue every two years. The question of independence is very important. If it breaks down quickly, we might have to return in two years to establish an independent body because our constituents do not believe that the trust that convenes the panel that considers the complaint is sufficiently independent for them to have faith in a good service from the complaints procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I have not yet persuaded him that considerable independence exists under the Bill, but it is a matter of balance in the final analysis. The Government think that the fact that two thirds of the local review—two out of the three people—are totally independent, means we have a substantial element—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are selected by someone who is not independent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. They are not selected by someone who is not independent, but from lists maintained by the regional chairman, totally outside the trust's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
ambit. Therefore, those people are completely independent. Two out of the three people on any local review will be totally independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convener of the review must consult with the chairman about whether there should be a review. That provides a further independent element. Also, in studying the Bill, we came to the conclusion that if one went for a body totally outside the provider's remit, one would break an important link of responsibility. The trusts have responsibilities to the people whom they serve and the non-executives of those trusts are guardians of that responsibility. Therefore, a balance must be struck between taking a responsible view of one's actions and deciding to review those actions as set out in the regulations. and the total independence of the review procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give the majority of the seats on a three-man review to totally independent people but to have one third with a link to the hospital—that person will be able to see more clearly what might have gone wrong, since he would be familiar with the procedures in a specific case—provides an element of responsibility that should not be shirked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, the issue is a matter of judgment. The hon. Member for Rother Valley might prove to be right in the long run, but I hope that I am proved right in the long run. This is a balanced judgment. The Government's opinion is that the balance is right between responsibility and independence and that there is sufficient independence to give the review a clear role and enable it to reach sensible conclusions, independent in their own right. That is our view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 4, line 32, after "exhausted", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>",or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) a complainant has elected to refer the action to a Commissioner with a request for investigation before the other procedure is exhausted.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment provides for complainants to refer investigations to a commissioner if they have lost faith in the system's ability to deal effectively and fairly with them. If complainants are dissatisfied with their attempt to air a grievance under the new procedures,
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
they may elect to go straight to the commissioner. I have recently had several conversations with health professionals, and they think that the most likely reason for complainants' failure to follow through their grievance is that they doubt the independence of the complaints procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two-stage procedure that was outlined by Ministers on Second Reading and reiterated in the documents that were produced by the NHS executive and the commissioner is potentially flawed. I say "potentially" because I am prepared to have faith in the rectitude of those who will administer the procedure. I say "flawed", however, because many of the aggrieved parties who will want to use the procedure will not have such faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The outline procedure for the complaints system prior to referral to the commissioner is covered by clause 5 and by section 4 of the 1993 Act, which clause 5 amends. It is further governed by new statutory instruments, which the Committee will not consider. We shall, however, have to study them in the next few months if we are meet the ambitious timetable for the complaints procedure, which is to be in place by April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from Ministers' comments and various documents that the two-stage procedure in clause 5, which the amendment seeks to improve, will have to be exhausted in the majority of cases before the commissioner intervenes. The amendment addresses, however, the equally important minority of cases. No one has figures for the size of that minority because it includes not only cases in which the commissioner takes action but those that are dropped and never come to his notice because of frustration or dissatisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his comments on the Bill, the commissioner says that he
	<br><blockquote><p>"will not normally investigate a complaint unless the relevant NHS procedures have been exhausted".</p></blockquote>
He adds that those procedures "should be fully used" before he investigates. That is a problem because the commissioner will apparently not intervene unless the two-stage procedure has been exhausted—except in rare instances of unreasonableness, when he may use his discretion. One definition of unreasonableness, says the commissioner, might include
	<br><blockquote><p>"clear evidence that the local investigations had led to an irretrievable breakdown in a complainant's confidence in the local arrangements".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would make life simpler. If the complainant elected to refer his complaint to a commissioner, that would be clear evidence. The complainant might decide to refer his complaint to a commissioner after the first stage if he thought that he would not do very well at the second stage. There might be many reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment may look like an open door to get rid of stage 2, but we are trying to clarify the circumstances in which the commissioner could be called in. We know that the commissioner may investigate a complaint that has not completed the second stage of the procedure, but the notes and discussions that we have had show that the position is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
ambiguous. We do not want knowingly to erect hurdles that people cannot jump over so that they cannot refer their complaints to the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health professionals to whom I have spoken are unclear about how a complainant gets from stage 2 of the procedure to the referral of his complaint to a commissioner, so our constituents will also be unclear about that. We believe that referral should be possible even if stages 1 and 2 have not been completed. We, as legislators, should make the position absolutely clear if the Bill, with its ambitious timetable, is to be the success that people want it to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is significant. My worry with the Bill—welcome though it is in all its many aspects—is that we will inadvertently marginalise the ombudsman in an arena in which he has proved to be admirably effective over the years. Unquestionably, the ombudsman has done more than anyone else to make people more sensitive to the needs of patients and to their complaints. Parliament has created a proven instrument that has been much used and valued by the health service and by patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are not careful, in doing what has to be done, which is to sort out the internal complaints machinery, we will remove the ability of the ombudsman to roam freely around the service and to produce the benefits to individual complainants and the quality improvements in the service that he has demonstrably achieved in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a memorandum to the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in May 1994, the health service ombudsman noted that paragraph 267 of the Wilson report said that a complainant should be able to ask the health service ombudsman to investigate "at any stage". The ombudsman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would not intervene where the first stage procedures have not been exhausted. However, where a complainant has had a formal investigation at the behest of the chief executive, I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to expect in every case that the complainant should have to go to stage 2 before coming to me".</p></blockquote>
That was a clear statement from the ombudsman that the complainant should, at the end of the first, internal stage, be able to decide whether it is more appropriate to take the complaint through the new independent review procedure, which we are unable to discuss here, but which is at the heart of the proposals, or to use the ombudsman method, which is tried and tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Minister that the fact that there is a variety of available routes, each with their own ethos, advantages and limitations, accords with the spirit of everything that Opposition Members have been saying. Indeed, we had exactly that discussion earlier, when we talked about the comparable merits of ombudsman routes versus the courts. It seems right, therefore, that complainants, knowing of the variety of available routes and something of the history of the ombudsman's role in that area, should feel that in their case, the ombudsman's route with an ombudsman-style investigation is most appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley said, the way to resolve the grey area of confusion is simply to retain the right of a complainant to choose the route. Although the ombudsman uses a test of reasonableness to decide whether it is appropriate for him to investigate before the internal stages—including stages 1 and 2—have been exhausted, in the future, compainants could decide at the end of the internal stage whether they would rather go through an ombudsman procedure. That is consistent not only with what Opposition Members were saying earlier, but with what the Government like to proclaim as their belief in charters and choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Citizens, patients and complaints, having had an initial, internal investigation, should be able to choose whether to use established ombudsman machinery to investigate their complaint or whether to employ another route; whether that is an independent review panel or the courts is for the complainant to decide. The amendment simply assets the right of those complainants to request the ombudsman route. It does not guarantee that the ombudsman will investigate their case, but it enshrines the right of individuals to retain that route as the most appropriate in their cases. In doing so, I argue that it also reflects what the ombudsman said when he first considered the report of the Wilson committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reply to the points made by the hon. Members for Rother Valley and for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright). In setting out the view that the health service commissioner should come into play only once the first two stages of the procedure are exhausted, we are trying to achieve two goals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we are trying to give real substance to the first two stages. Under the amendment, complainants could opt for the ombudsman straight away, whatever their view—there is no check on their view. In that case, the danger is that the first two stages of procedure would not be properly tested. If we are to set up a clear track through the health service for complainants in a three-stage process which, by definition, gets more heavyweight the further one progresses, it is important to try to resolve as many problems as possible close to the source of the original complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first staging post is the local resolution, when an individual can take up the issue face to face with the GP, the GP fundholder or the trust. We still propose to embody in the Bill the individual's right to receive a letter from the trust's chief executive in cases where complaints have been made under local resolution procedures. It is important that we are not abolishing that right. That is the first important stage in the procedure. It may well be that many people seeking an apology or trying to ensure that nobody else suffers as they have, will be satisfied. I cannot tell the Committee exactly how many cases we expect to be resolved at that stage—we are talking about practice in the future. I certainly hope that a great many will be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also allow provision for an independent review. If it is to be meaningful, there should be a serious attempt to examine the possibilities, which could be done quickly. I hope that it will be carried out by people on the ground who understand the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We allow full play in all stages of the package. We have gone to much trouble to ensure that people in the health service fully understand each stage of the new procedures. A long training programme will be put in place. Much relevant literature has been produced. We are serious about complaints procedures and we believe that, as far as possible, they should be retained within the health service. Health professionals as well as non-executives and other advisers should carefully consider what has gone wrong within the health service in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood underestimates the degree of flexibility in the system. The commissioner has made it clear in his paper that he will be prepared to side-step or act earlier than is provided for under the three-stage procedure if he feels that the procedure is being unreasonably operated. The commissioner quotes the example of inordinate delay in stage 2 when, if he judges it appropriate, he could enter proceedings earlier than expected. Likewise, if the relationship between the complainant and the service provider has broken down—there will be instances when the last person whom a complainant wants to investigate a complaint will be the person whom he feels is responsible for what happened—local resolution will be inappopriate and the health service comissioner could step in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a further point relating to the discussion between my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley and the Minister. If a complainant felt doubtful about the independence of the convener role under stage 2, had no confidence in the integrity and independence of the review procedure and wanted to take his complaint to a demonstrably independent body—the health service ombudsman—does the Minister accept that that would consititute a ground of reasonableness so that the ombudsman could investigate further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That example could come under the heading of a breakdown of a relationship between the complainant and the local service provider. If a complainant genuinely felt—and there were reasonably hard grounds to support it—that a local provider would not be fully independent, I have no doubt that the health service commissioner would be prepared to consider the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to deal with the general points behind the specific examples. First, we must allow the three stages to operate fully. Secondly, we must allow the health service commissioner to judge when all the stages have been exhausted. If he concludes that relationships between the complainant and provider have broken
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
down or that there has been undue delay—he gave two such examples in his document—he will pre-empt proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not disagree with the hon, Gentleman, but the circumstances are important. One of the difficulties that we face is that we are trying to look ahead to particular examples and determine whether they will be handled in a certain way. If, in the case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, there is reason to doubt the independence of the second stage, the commissioner will want to take into account whether local procedures have been properly exhausted—he has that flexibility. One cannot say whether he will intervene in our hypothetical example, but the possibility exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The package of arrangements will be put in place on 1 April and will consist of three stages. It is important, however, that we give the whole package a chance to work. Much effort has gone into making the Bill sensible and I do not, therefore, want it to be amended. The commissioner should maintain his current freedom to decide whether the appropriate procedures in stages 1 and 2 have been exhausted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether matters are any clearer after the Minister's explanation—it would perhaps be right to say that they are as clear as mud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that stages 1 and 2 must be of real substance—no one would disagree with that. Matters could then reach a conclusion without the commissioner needing to consider the complaints procedures. The problem is that there are several "What ifs", and we shall probably not be able to bottom them. Several health professionals have told me that they are unsure about the way in which the package will operate. What will happen if there is a breakdown and what constitutes a breakdown at the second stage? How will we know when the commissioner can move in, pick the process up and move it towards a conclusion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we debated the package for the rest of our sitting and until next Thursday, we would probably be none the wiser about how it will operate. I hope that matters will be clarified later—perhaps the House will be able to debate the statutory instruments which will bring the initial procedures into being. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the amendments is straightforward. They seek to provide another route by which cases can come within the ombudsman's remit. They amend the relevant section of the 1993 Act to ensure that that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is straightforward and general. At the moment the only way in which cases can reach the ombudsman in any of his jurisdictions is through an individual complainant. On the non-health service side, the route is through an independent complainant arousing the interest of a Member of Parliament. That is because of the filter mechanism, which ironically, is not present, on the health service side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, there have been discussions about whether there ought to be other routes into the ombudsman system and whether, when cases are demonstrably crying out for investigation, there should be mechanisms to enable the ombudsman to consider them. That has been explored many times by the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and not only the current Select Committee. The issue was examined and recommendations to that effect made in reports in 1977, 1978 and 1990–91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most recent Select Committee report of 1993, entitled "The powers, work and jurisdiction of the ombudsman", again returns to the question of whether there should be a mechanism, involving the Select Committee, to enable cases to be put to the ombudsman for possible investigation. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee has in the past recommended that the Ombudsman be granted the power to initiate investigations. We continue to believe that on occasion this power might prove useful to the Ombudsman. We agree with Justice and the Centre for Ombudsman Studies that such an investigation should only be undertaken where this Committee has raised the matter formally with the Ombudsman as a matter of concern. Thus the Ombudsman's links with Parliament would be maintained. The Ombudsman would, of course, retain his discretion to refuse to investigate. He would initiate an investigation if the matter raised by the Committee seemed to him to provide reasonable grounds for believing that maladministration leading to injustice may have occurred. There would not, however, be the requirement for an aggrieved individual to present a case in which there is prima facie evidence of their having suffered maladministration leading to injustice."</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the Government introduce legislation to grant the Ombudsman the power to initiate investigations at the recommendation of this Committee."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is designed to transplant into the Bill that recommendation in relation to the health service remit of the ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be occasions when, through the device of the Select Committee, the instrument—the ombudsman—that Parliament created to investigate maladministration and injustice can be used where there is prima facie evidence of such maladministration and injustice, without having to
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
wait for other routes to be used. That is a fairly easy and straightforward idea with a long pedigree. I shall give one instance of such an occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case of poor Mrs. Banks is in everyone's mind at the moment. She was taken to the mortuary, but turned out to be alive. Anyone considering the case would think that it needs instant, full and thorough investigation, and yet, there has been some difficulty in getting that investigation put in place. Some organisations have said, "It is not our problem. We were not in error. We are not the ones who should investigate it." The local health commission said that it would investigate, but has had to delay the results of its initial investigation because it is finding that the issue is complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1966, Parliament set up an instrument to enable it to put in hand investigations of alleged maladministration and injustice. When we come across a case such as that of Mrs. Banks, where the whole country is screaming out for some rigorous, independent inquiry to find out exactly how such a monstrous thing could have happened, we have the instrument to hand. It would be entirely proper to ask a Select Committee, charged with the instrument's supervision, to initiate such an inquiry. The result would be an enormous increase in public confidence in the instrument, and its visibility. In addition, the House's ability to investigate such matters would be hugely increased. The amendment simply inserts into the Bill an idea with a long pedigree that would open up another route into the operation of the ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Select Committees often decide on and instigate subject-specific inquiries, but that process is prompted by hon. Members. We decide on the subjects of Select Committee investigations. The process outlined in the amendment would permit such investigations to be instigated as a result of popular demand, with the agenda set elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposal has merit. The public often complain that Members of Parliament do not respond to their concerns; much of what they see us do does not appear relevant to the issues at the top of their agenda. Thay also are aware, whenever an issue causes concern, that Members of Parliament always deliberate first about the appropriate method of inquiry. People often find that unsatisfactory, and there are all sorts of alternatives when the plea goes up for a public inquiry. For example, legislation could define what a public inquiry was and who should chair it and so on, but it would be good to have a process that the public could initiate without Government say-so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the frustrations of the administrative system is that power to decide when a public inquiry should be held too often resides with the Executive rather than with the public. I shall give the Committee one example of that. The pleasure boat Marchioness sank only yards from here, and for constituency reasons I became involved in that tragedy. Several years later, the coroner's inquest has at last been held and has brought in a verdict of unlawful killing. There was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
demand for a public inquiry at that hearing, but no inquiry was held because the Government had decided that none would be held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The families involved are still not happy about that. It was only because the courts eventually allowed an inquest, and because the coroner was generous in his interpretation of what an inquest should be, that a wide-ranging investigation got to the bottom of what happened. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the idea that the route proposed in the amendment should be pursued. Even if he is wary of responding immediately, there is evidence in support of the amendment to be found in Select Committee reports. Moreover, I understand that the commissioner's nervousness about the proposal is of a general nature—related to a desire not to take on too much work—rather than the result of specific opposition. The Government confirmed on Second Reading that they intend to give the commissioner the capacity to respond, so there should be no major objection to the alternative proposed in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted carefully what has been said in support of the amendment. The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood spoke about the tragic case of Mrs. Banks, and said the whole country is screaming for a proper investigation. In fact, a proper investigation is taking place and I am sure that the local Huntingdon health authority commission is examining the matter very thoroughly. The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) said that we should have investigations that do not depend on Government say-so and which are outwith the powers of the Executive. Both those points are reasonable, but they are met by the fundamental point behind the entire parliamentary commissioner and health commissioner system—that the individual lies at the heart of the matter. The individual citizen—not the Government, not Members of Parliament and not even members of Select Committees—has been wronged and it is the individual citizen who initiates the whole process. I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey will concede that that is the right approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Mrs. Banks, for example—there is also the Marchioness case, in which the families might decide not pursue the matter beyond a certain point—if the family decided not to have an investigation for reasons of personal privacy, it could not be right for someone else, whether ourselves or members of Select Committees, parliamentary commissioners and so forth, to go beyond what those individuals wanted. A very important principle is at issue here, which may go wider than the Bill, but which has been relevant from the beginning of our proceedings—that the individual alone can initiate investigations. That principle remains strong and we undermine it at our peril.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is profoundly misguided and I shall tell him why. He has cited a good example. To put it coldly, I lost a little sympathy with the Banks family when I saw their solicitor being interviewed on
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
television and found out what road they would be going down. Substantial action will be taken against someone in connection with that case—I have no doubt that it should be. The Minister seems to be saying, however, that it is the family's decision, that that is the end of the matter and that it is no one else's concern. He is profoundly wrong. That case shows that there is a public interest in finding out what has gone wrong. The merit of the ombudsman system has not resided solely in unravelling problems, but in using the unravelling process to reveal systemic failures, which in turn have led to systemic improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Banks case is not a good one for the Minister's argument, for it reveals that an overwhelming public interest is involved, to which Parliament should respond by ensuring that a public interest investigation is mounted to establish exactly how it happened. The investigation should not depend on someone choosing one route—perhaps a legal route in this case—rather than another. We have a suitable mechanism. We invented it and it works. I am saying that we must use it. That is what the amendment is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, the example of Mrs. Banks—I am sorry that we are using it, because it is such a tragic case—proves my point. The public interest is served by an investigation by the local commission. That is clearly happening and the circumstances are being considered. However, we should not confuse that with what the Bill is centrally about—the right of the individual, and solely the individual, to take complaints forward eventually to the health service commissioner. That lies at the heart of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until we take a principled decision to consider the wider issues and the entire system again—the parliamentary commissioner as well as the health service commissioner—it would be wrong to depart from the system that has existed throughout the history of the ombudsman, during the past 20 or 30 years. We could look even further back and consider the Swedish system. The individual has been at the heart of the matter and, if we compromise on that, we will be on dangerous ground. It is on grounds of principle, then, that I must resist the amendments. The public interest can be taken into account through other methods of the sort used in the Banks case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 17, in clause 8, page 5, line 25, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) after subsection (2)(b) there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) matters in respect of which a complaint is made to a Commissioner by or on behalf of a patient that he has sustained injustice or hardship thereby.'.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would bring personnel matters within the commissioner's remit so that he could investigate action taken on staff appointments, removals, pay and discipline on the grounds that they could detrimentally affect patient care and, to use the jargon, cause injustice or hardship. Amendment No. 17 would extend the commissioner's right to investigate to matters relating to contractual or other commercial transactions that may have a detrimental effect on patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the amendments—particularly in view of the comments made by the Minister in column 22 of our proceedings of 19 December—is to examine the issues surrounding decisions on staffing and contractual relationships that have been taken primarily for administrative or financial purposes, which, in themselves, have health care consequences. There is a growing trend in health care for decisions to be based on financial considerations. Unfortunately, because of the pressure of budgets, genuine health care occasionally takes a back seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the restrictions on their budgets, providers and health authorities may take those decisions properly, but the patient has no way of complaining about their consequences and the effect on patient care. The Minister has told us that the commissioner will be able to investigate purchasing decisions. These are probing amendments to clarify the position on tendering and other contractual decisions. The 1993 Act specifically prohibits any such investigations. The commissioner has no scope to investigate personnel or contractual matters. In practice, however, a patient's right to treatment and the quality of care that he receives is altered by the financial decisions of providers and the purchasing decisons of health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 67 on page 21 of his paper "Responsibilities of the Health Service Commissioner", Mr. Reid states that the commissioner
	<br><blockquote><p>"will not be disposed to investigate issues which he knows are, or are about to be, the subject of a NHS disciplinary investigation."</p></blockquote>
There is evidence, however, that health service employers have invoked disciplinary procedures against staff who have acted in what they believed to be the best interests of patients. I refer the Committee to the case of nurse Pink in Manchester, who, not long after his hospital became a trust, drew the media's attention to the impact of certain contracts on the provision of health care. He was disciplined and then dismissed only to be reinstated. We have evidence that it is possible for a health provider to instigate disciplinary action, although not necessarily in order deliberately to preclude the ombudsman from investigating a case. But as I read the Bill, it would have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disciplinary action may also result from industrial action, which could be prompted by a reduction in resource allocation or staff, or by the closure of a ward. The provider may believe that the proper procedures were not followed and could instigate disciplinary action, which would prevent the commission from investigating a complaint made by a patient as a result of that administrative decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would rectify this sad omission in the commission's remit by allowing him to investigate the contractual actions that lead to a patient suffering an injustice or hardship. I represent a rural constituency, which has one district general hospital—the next one is 35 or 40 miles away. The provision of a comprehensive health care service in rural areas is extremely difficult. Decisions may be taken by a provider or a health authority to relocate certain specialities in a given area. They may decide to base a piece of equipment, such as a scanner, in a district hospital that is many miles from a constituent who has received a severe head injury and requires immediate treatment or tests using a scanner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner should be allowed to investigate those decisions if they cause hardship or damage to patients. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey) referred to a constituent who had to be transferred to Leeds: sadly, the treatment available did not save his life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that, unless we amend the Bill, some patients will suffer hardship. They will qualify for their case to be investigated by the commissioner, but because it relates to contractual and personnel matters he will not be able to do so. That will short-circuit the procedure and prevent complaints from being heard, which is what we all want the Bill to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand and sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I can reassure him that nothing in the clause will inhibit the health service commission from investigating the circumstances that he described. The commissioner can investigate matters across the board: he is not hindered in any way. He can examine a failure of service, a case in which no service has been provided and maladministration. If an employee of the health authority or the provider has contributed to those, his action can be investigated by the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difficulty at all; no let or hindrance in the remit of the health service commissioner. The clause is designed to do a simple thing; not to allow the commissioner to consider personnel matters per se. That means matters that are really contractual or that constitute a breach of service between an employee and his employer—in this case, the health provider or the general practitioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not sensible for the health service commissioner to be involved in employment matters, so the clause rules them out of his remit. However, the health service commissioner can examine any complaint which arises as the hon. Gentleman sketched out—as a result of a service failure or a failure to provide a satisfactory service or because of an administration failure—and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
leads to hardship. There is no difficulty with that. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that his amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will speak briefly, first because I am delighted by the Minister's comments and, secondly, because I am slightly surprised, although I should not be—his remarks were in keeping with his earlier comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to get on the record an important issue which is partly dealt with in one of our new clauses. Am I right to think that if a health service manager decides to close down two beds out of six in an intensive care unit for financial reasons and a patient complains that he was unable to get into the intensive care facility as a result, that is a viable matter for investigation by the health service commissioner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are returning to the issues of purchasing and allocation of resources. It is indeed the case that any decision about purchasing can, in principle, be examined by the commissioner providing that all the other elements of his remit are met—namely, that the complainant has suffered hardship which can be described as a failure of the service, as a service not being provided, as maladministration or as clinical misjudgment, which brings it within the Bill's boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is basically yes: the health service commissioner can investigate a decision such as the hon. Gentleman mentioned; there is no let or hindrance on what he can investigate. But he could also find against the health authority if he concluded that the decision was so unreasonable as to amount to maladministration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister is trying to be devious and I am not trying to be nitpicking, but this is important and I need clarification. The Minister used the word "purchasing", which normally establishes the relationship between an authority and a trust. The principle he enunciated provided a helpful explanation, but let us make it clear that it does not apply simply between an authority and a trust; it could also apply within the trust. For example, a health authority could purchase treatment for 200 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhages; that would be an issue for the health service commissioner. However, if, within a trust, a manager decided that he would not further fund a certain treatment—for example if he would not purchase a drug called nimotop or nimodipine that would help the patient—could the health service commissioner examine that if a patient raised a complaint about clinical judgment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he could.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any action or decision taken by a manager could in principle be examined by the health service commissioner. I am not saying what conclusion the health service commissioner might reach but in
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
principle it could be examined, provided that it was within the remit of the health service commissioner—namely that hardship or injustice had been suffered as a result of a failure in service, a failure to provide a service or maladministration. Within that remit, such issues can be considered. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask for further clarification about cases where disciplinary action is being considered or taken? Paragraph 67 on page 21 of the document detailing the health service commissioner's responsibilities states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In general he will not be disposed to investigate issues which he knows are, or about to be, the subject of a NHS disciplinary investigation."</p></blockquote>
It is conceivable as I said in my opening remarks that disciplinary action could be in process or about to start. It is possible that a trust employee such as a nurse or a doctor had done nothing, but had spoken in breach of his contract—we are aware that many trusts have secrecy and disclosure clauses—by speaking to the media. If that employee subsequently faced disciplinary action, would the health commissioner be prevented from investigating that case because, according to my understanding of paragraph 67, he would not be disposed to investigate issues which he knew were about to be the subject of an NHS disciplinary investigation? That must be clarified. I accept the Minister's comments about the ombudsman not wanting to get directly involved in personnel matters, but when those are involved in a complaint from a patient who has suffered hardship, I am worried that the sentence I quoted from the commissioner's description of how he considers his responsibilities would preclude him from investigating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My clear understanding is that it would be within the discretion of the health service commissioner to carry on that investigation, even were disciplinary proceedings started against an individual connected with it. I point the hon. Gentleman to the final sentences of paragraph 67:
	<br><blockquote><p>"His investigations are, and will continue to be, solely concerned with disciplinary matters. Nor will the Ombudsman make recommendations relating to disciplinary action that others might be able to take."</p></blockquote>
So, within the ombudsman's discretion, he can continue such an investigation whatever may be happening with disciplinary matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where would that take us in the context of a disciplinary case that might, potentially, go before another body? It might be that the circumstances are such that they become subject to a health service disciplinary inquiry, but the matter might conceivably result in a dismissal. That could lead to breach of contract or industrial tribunal proceedings. Where would that lead us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a separate matter. Disciplinary matters are quite separate and disciplinary procedures will continue as at present. The Bill introduces no change to disciplinary procedures. All that happens is that where the health service commissioner has taken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
up a case from which consequences might flow, he will narrowly examine that case to try to judge whether maladministration or clinical error have occurred. Given what is written in paragraph 67, I imagine that the commissioner will try to disregard elements of discipline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it then that if a parallel disciplinary inquiry suddenly resulted in a dismissal, the ombudsman would then stop his inquiry as a matter of course because the dismissal could be dealt with by another body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot prejudge what the ombudsman will do in such circumstances. That is the difficulty that the Committee faces. We are setting out a broad situation, but we cannot hypothesise too much about the circumstances in which the ombudsman will find himself—those will differ greatly from case to case. I can however assure the hon. Gentleman that the ombudsman will have discretion and will be able to decide whether to continue with a case regardless of what happens on the disciplinary front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the confusions about the Bill is revealed here. We are not sure what "personnel matters" means—it is a blanket term. Certain categories in the 1993 Act were, for various plausible reasons, designated as no-go areas for the ombudsman, and personnel matters were a major category of exemption. Whenever cases come before the ombudsman and red lights start flashing because they appear to be personnel matters, his response is that he cannot investigate them because Parliament has told him so. The Committee will be delighted to know that I do not have the list of all the cases that the ombudsman has to reject for investigation in his parliamentary commissioner and health service remits. If we read through it, however, we would find that personnel matters are a major category. There is a difficulty, however, because his remit also tells him that he is empowered to consider "failures of service". What if personnel matters include failures of service? How do those issues mesh?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman has properly taken a rigorous and restrictive view of the matter and said that Parliament did not intend his remit to cover anything that looked, prima facie, like a personnel matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to clear the matter up now. The hon. Gentleman whether the health service commissioner will be able to investigate a personnel matter that leads to a failure of service although that has not been the case in the past. I do not know about the past, but the commissioner should be able in principle to investigate any failure of service, however it arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that response. I hope, however, that the lawyers are not shuffling their feet—that is not the traditional understanding of the matter. The Minister helps me more than I wanted him to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that that is his way. I wanted to persuade him about issues of demonstrable injustice and hardship to individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So when we discover cases of failure in service, whatever the source, and cases of injustice and hardship to individuals, whatever the source, the ombudsman will be able to investigate them even if they look like personnel matters. I think that I am right in saying that that will come as a revelation to the ombudsman. One can understand why Parliament intended to proceed in the way that it did. Procedures were already in place to deal with personnel matters. As the Minister said a few moments ago, separate machinery is available to deal with personnel matters per se.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to make a separate point—that the commissioner can investigate personnel matters per se. Of course, he cannot. My point is that if there is a failure of service, then, in principle—this is what the Bill is all about—the health service commissioner will be able to investigate that failure, providing that it has led to hardship and fulfilled the other conditions. That is not a surprise; it is the burden of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, as I keep saying, I am grateful that the phrase personnel matters is no longer to be used as a keep out sign as far as the ombudsman's activities are concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not misinterpret me. Clause 8 specifically does not permit the ombudsman to consider personnel matters. That is the whole point of the clause. Personnel matters refer to, for example, whether a board can remove an individual and other disciplinary matters of that kind, or relations between an employee and the trust, the board or the authority. He cannot consider those per se, but if there is a failure of service as a consequence of which the ombudsman has to consider other matters, he has the discretion to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are genuinely reaching a consensus which I shall seize upon. I am almost ready to sit down. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I hear grunts of assent from Whippish directions. Perhaps I may consolidate the consensus by stating what I understand to be the case. I think that the Minister is now agreeing with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When issues are simply personnel matters—when they are locked into what we understand to be the relationship between an employer and an employee—they can be dealt with by separate machinery. There will be some cases that are, in part, personnel matters, because they touch on that relationship and therefore get locked inside that machinery. At the same time, however, they can raise issues about injustice and hardship to individuals as well as about failures of service as a whole. I am heartened by the Minister's contention that the ombudsman will no longer feel that that grey area is a no-go area. Where it can be demonstrably shown that there is injustice and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
