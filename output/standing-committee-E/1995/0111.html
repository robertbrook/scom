	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton, for your greetings, which I reciprocate on behalf of the Committee. Your wish probably cannot be executed in every sense, although I hope that it can be in as many senses as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
I hope the Minister will be positive about amendment No. 18 because much of its substance derives from the recommendations behind the Bill. It could have been tabled as three amendments because, although it deals with the general proposition that the annual report of the commissioner should be expanded, three specific propositions follow from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that the annual report should contain
	<br><blockquote><p>"a list of the measures taken by the Commissioner in the previous year to advertise his work".</p></blockquote>
The second is that the report should contain
	<br><blockquote><p>"details of the length of time between the commencement of each investigation and the granting of redress, if any".</p></blockquote>
The third is that the name of the relevant authority, board or trust should be included in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first proposition would ensure that the commissioner's work was known as widely as possible and that he told people of the extent to which he had achieved that aim. Much of our debate has been about the way in which the commissioner's work can become widely known, understood and used, and, therefore, achieve what Parliament sought to do in the original legislation and seeks to do in the Bill. The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright) has been the greatest contributor to that debate. One of the problems that we face is that people have traditionally been discouraged from becoming involved with a system that seeks to redress their complaints because they do not understand it. When the Bill is enacted, more remedies will be available and they will apply to wider areas of health service work. It is, therefore, important that people know that such services are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument in favour of the first proposition is backed by earlier work, and I shall cite pages 9 and 10 of the first report of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration from November 1993. Paragraph 22 makes the case for the proposition, and I hope that it is even more persuasive than I would be if I were not supported by its authority. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is vital that the Office of the Ombudsman is publicised effectively if appropriate complaints are going to reach him. We have, however, received evidence claiming that there are still many who are ignorant of his services. Justice believed that the MP filter resulted in a lack of visibility for the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the fragmented nature of the NHS complaints system resulted in a similar problem for the Health Service Ombudsman. The UKCC did not believe that NHS staff knew enough of the Health Service Ombudsman's work. The ACHCEW thought that 'the existing public awareness of the Commissioner and … his work is extremely low and … more could be done to publicise it'".</p></blockquote>
The next paragraph gives a useful comparative figure. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We learned that in the Netherlands a survey had been conducted into public awareness of the Ombudsman. 93 per cent. had some knowledge of his work."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what your view is, Mr. Winterton, but if 93 per cent. of electors in Bermondsey and in Macclesfield were aware of the work of the ombudsman we would be seeking a high honour in the new year's honours list. That figure is incredible, the like of which none of us would expect to achieve. It was achieved just over the water, so it can be done and it would be good if it could be achieved here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
The argument goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the United Kingdom there has been much speculation as to the level of public awareness of the Ombudsman. Too much comment in the past has, however, relied on supposition. There should be continuing research on the work and effectiveness of the Ombudsman system. We recommend … a survey."</p></blockquote>
The Committee went on to recommend a consumer satisfaction survey, but—this is the most important conclusion—in paragraph 25 it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would encourage the Ombudsman to continue his efforts to publicise his work both among Members and the public. We see value, for instance, in the publication of a periodic newsletter which will summarise cases of interest in a more popular and easily accessible form than can be the case in the report proper. We were disappointed to note that 54.3 per cent. of Members responding to the Questionnaire"—</p></blockquote>
I do not know who the 0.3 per cent. are—
	<br><blockquote><p>" 'hardly ever' or 'never' read Ombudsman reports. … We do not believe that there is a single easy formula which will make the Ombudsman's Office generally known. We do consider that efforts in the past have borne fruit and that there must be a continuous reappraisal of how best to publicise the Ombudsman's services and an exploration of all those ways that might foster increased accessibility."</p></blockquote>
Let us continue always to find new ways of publicising what the ombudsman does and let us include that aim in the report so that the rest of us—the public and informed commentators—can assess and evaluate its effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Consumer Council makes the same recommendation. I shall also cite another piece of persuasive evidence, that of the commissioner himself in oral evidence to the PCA Select Committee on 24 November 1993. At column 5 he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is one area in which I am wholly dissatisfied with my performance, that is, outreach to ethnic minorities. Next year when I have my leaflets reprinted I will have them done in a variety of ethnic minority languages".</p></blockquote>
He goes on to explain why that defect has occurred. The Chairman of the Committee at that time, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey), said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"May I suggest that you also use some of the flourishing ethnic minority newspapers. Were you to use them you would certainly reach great chunks of the ethnic community."</p></blockquote>
On the issue of publicity, he suggested that the ombudsman should attempt to contact all race equality councils to give them advice and assistance. The commissioner said in reply:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think it is going to be one of the themes of the next world conference of ombudsmen: how to ensure our outreach."</p></blockquote>
The evidence is clear that there was concern about general and specific areas of information. The amendment would deal with that by requiring reporting back. I hope that the Minister will see the merit of writing that requirement into the Bill instead of leaving the matter to the discretion of the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed paragraph (b) of amendment No. 18 deals with the length of time taken in each investigation. That is always a matter of concern to the ombudsman and his staff as justice delayed is often perceived as—and sometimes is—justice denied. I refer the Minister to paragraph 12 of the first Select Committee report, which states:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is important that any complaint is investigated as speedily as is consistent with fairness and effectiveness. The results of the Questionnaire did not suggest that Members considered the time taken to be a significant problem."</p></blockquote>
In fact, 18 per cent. were not satisfied and 2 per cent. were very dissatisfied. The paragraph went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The work of the ombudsman has, however, frequently been criticised for the length of time taken to complete investigations and issue reports and this criticism was repeated during the course of our inquiry. That was also the view of the Centre for Ombudsman Studies and the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales".</p></blockquote>
When the report was written, the average investigation period was 12 months and 13 days, and for various reasons that average has risen and fallen since then. Paragraph 13 of the report recommended:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We consider, however, that investigations remain long and that every effort should be made to reduce still further the time taken, certainly to meet the nine months target"</p></blockquote>
—the target for completion that applied at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual report contains a meticulous record of the events and facts of the investigation. However, it does not contain a record of the stages and timetable of the complaints process. That error could be rectified, although the amendment would not enforce a specific timetable for an inquiry. The theory is that charter-type targets, rather than a statutory requirement, would apply as they do in other aspects of public life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is true to say that no investigatory processes in the legal, court or tribunal systems are time limited in the sense that they have to end by a prescribed date. Of course, the periods in which many such processes must be begun are often prescribed—for example, the Minister will be aware that in certain cases criminal authorities must take action within a certain number of months, and industrial tribunal applications must be made within a certain time. However, I do not think that an end-point is ever specified in those processes and the amendment does not propose a maximum time for an investigation—that must be left open in each case. However, a statutory requirement to publish information about the time delay that can be examined by the Committee and the House is the best lever that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is simple and uncontroversial. In practice, the name of the relevant authority—trust, board and so on—is now included in the report. That has not always happened and there is no requirement that it should. The amendment would insert such a requirement into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept all the provisions in the amendment. I should be content if he were to say that he would prefer his officials to draft the amendment, making the same points but in different words. In any event, I hope that he will accept all our recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would defend your position as a member of the Chairmen's Panel to the last day of the year, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the arguments of the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) on amendment No. 18. Public perception of the new procedure will be vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 19 would require the commissioner to monitor and evaluate the new NHS complaints procedure as it relates to his increased work load for a fixed period following the Bill's enactment. It would also require the commissioner to involve all interested parties in the monitoring process and to make available to the House reports of his findings for each of the fixed periods in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said on Second Reading, rightly, that the Bill would bring about significant changes to the role of the health service commissioner; indeed, he described the changes as "radical", which is right. The new procedures are, however, as yet untested. It would therefore be sensible to monitor and evaluate the operation of the new procedures, thereby assessing the outcome for patients of the new system during the early years of its operation. Amendment No. 19 would require such evaluation and monitoring to take place over the first three years. That period would be sufficient for any likely problems and possible failings in the new procedures to be confronted and addressed by the commissioner and, if necessary, by the Government too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the monitoring and evaluation process is not merely an internal one for the commissioner and his staff. I realise that he has independence, and rightly so, but evaluation should not be limited to the commissioner. Instead, it should be spread throughout users of the complaints system and should encompass interested and involved organisations outside the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require three simple forms of monitoring. First, a complaints satisfaction survey would be conducted. A minimum of one survey in the first three years would assess what users of the new system think of it and of the service provided by the commissioner. That is vital; at the end of the day, the Bill and stages 1 and 2 are about giving users access to the correct complaints procedure, one which will give them satisfaction. A survey of users' views would be a good thing. After all, the commissioner is the ultimate authority for complainants using the system and it is therefore right that he should ensure that his work is responsive to customers' needs. He may even find that the satisfaction survey is so helpful to his work that he wants to conduct further surveys. There is certainly scope for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would require a minimum of one meeting to be held in each of the first three years for relevant interests to discuss and evaluate developments and emerging issues as they affect service users and the commissioner. We envisage that such relevant interests would include patients organisations, the various professional bodies, the commissioner's advisers and consultants as well as national health service managers, health service bodies and family health service providers. The form of such meetings will be left to the commissioner's discretion. Perhaps different groups would meet separately with the commissioner in various circumstances or perhaps an annual meeting of users would take place. The aim is primarily to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
gain the confidence of organisations that represent our constituents and are independent from the service providers in the health system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly and finally, amendment No. 19 requires that a report of annual meetings he published along with the findings of the complainant survey and any resulting recommendations for amending the NHS complaints system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 already requires the commissioner to place annual reports and special reports before Parliament—I expect such reports as we propose in paragraph (c) of the amendment to be included in the special reports category and presented to the House. The amendment arose as a result of discussions with the National Consumer Council, which provides a vigorous and independent voice for consumers of all types of public service. The council agreed with us that the proposed new service is so different from its predecessor that certain checks and balances should be included for the first few years. The monitoring and evaluation provided by the amendment should add relatively little to the commissioner's costs or work load—certainly not sufficient to require an extra allocation of Government resources—but a small extra input by the commissioner has the potential to yield large additional dividends for the complainant system and for the NHS as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the commissioner is to be his most efficient and to best serve the complainants who use his services, he needs to be able to assess how he makes decisions. Equally, if he is to hold and retain the confidence of health service bodies and family health service providers, he needs to know what they think of his work. The provision of complainant surveys will give the commissioner a much better view of how his service is received, while meetings with interested parties will allow him to hear from people and organisations with experience both of the older procedures and of a selection of cases with which the commissioner will have dealt under the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals represent extra quality controls and are intended as guides for the commissioner. The provision of reports to Parliament is intended to maintain the commissioner's accountability to the House. I echo the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey in asking the Minister whether, if the wording of the amendments is not to his liking, he will consider redrafting them, maintaining a quality control and a mechanism to gain the confidence of health service users—something that we all want—who might, from time to time, want to complain about how they have been treated in the system. I hope that the Minister will take that into account when he considers whether to accept amendments Nos. 18 and 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Faced with the amendments, I think that the commissioner would say that they reflected the good practice in which he is engaged. Indeed, one could say that the commissioner is trying to achieve all the aims suggested by the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner engages in active publicity for his office and has made great advances. In the face of professional opposition, he has latterly made it his policy to name health authorities, which has been important. A great merit of the system is that it disciplines the providers. The naming of trusts that have been maladministrated enables others in the system—at national and local levels through providers and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
purchases—to engage in conversations about maladministration. That is why it is so important for those bodies to be identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also clear that the commissioner routinely engages in conversations and discussions with outside organisations about his office and the nature of his work. I know that he is actively engaged in many conversations about the new responsibilities that he will be taking on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate for us to give statutory form to good practice as it has evolved. We should expect routine self-evaluations of the effectiveness of the machinery. That is entirely consistent with the citizens charter enterprise—monitoring and evaluation by organisations of the effectiveness of their complaints procedures. Vigorous attempts should be made to advertise and publicise and reports should be widely considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On grounds of delicacy, I was not going to mention the point to which the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey referred—on how well known is the ombudsman's work among Members of Parliament. Findings were dire. Asked if they were aware of these reports—after all, they are reports made to Parliament by Parliament's officer—Members produced a dismal response. Surely there are obligations on all sides here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey also mentioned the Dutch ombudsman. I vividly remember hearing the Dutch ombudsman talk about his job and his relationship to the Dutch Parliament. It was clear that the annual report of the Dutch ombudsman to the Dutch Parliament was the major moment for making judgments about the administrative record of Government Departments. An important debate takes place every year and the ombudsman's report is regarded as the key document. Here, Parliament does not insist on having an annual debate on the ombudsman's work, yet this institution set up the ombudsman to investigate maladministration in Government Departments. That shows, in microcosm how far we have to go in getting a grip on all these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendments, which reflect good practice. There are difficulties, however, some of which have not yet been explored. If we ask the ombudsman to give a global account in aggregate terms of how long each investigation should take, we may encounter difficulties under the new system because there will be more than one sort of investigation. The ombudsman will be asked to do a number of things. For example, he will be asked to hear appeals from people who believe that they have been denied an independent review. Are we to ask the ombudsman to account for how long it takes him to decide whether there should be an independent review? That is a rather difficult enterprise. How much background will be required before the ombudsman can make that decision? If the ombudsman says that there should be an independent review, is it a recommendation, or is it obligatory for the provider to undertake such a review? If the internal procedure is said to be exhausted, what then happens if someone goes to the ombudsman to ask for a full investigation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much work on the part of the ombudsman is necessary for him to make a proper decision as to whether he should undertake a further investigation? That is a daunting prospect. How much of a previous investigation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
has to be investigated before one can properly decide whether a further investigation should take place? Should the time taken to make that decision be counted as part of the ombudsman's time? So, there are real difficulties here, but it is nevertheless correct for us to try to establish how long each case will take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of building on existing good practice and taking the ombudsman system into the future, I hope that the Government will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Horam)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first add my voice to the general sentiments that you expressed earlier, Mr. Winterton. On behalf of the Government and Conservative Members, I can promise a further period of quiet, competent and responsive government. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I expect that this country's good citizens will not ask for change in the coming 12 months and that, even if they did, it would not be forthcoming. The Administration's quiet, competent and responsive nature is fully reflected in the Bill, which the Committee largely supports. Indeed, Opposition parties appear to support Government policies generally, although I am not sure whether the Leader of the Opposition always carries his supporters with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 18, the Government agree with the spirit of the remarks of the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey. The commissioner and the Government agree with him that we must ensure maximum openness and publicity for new and existing procedures. That is an admirable objective, which we fully support. Clause 10 carries those aims a step further. The commissioner's annual report will, henceforth, be laid directly before Parliament and he will not have to go via the Secretary of State, as at present. That is an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On paragraph (c) of amendment No. 18, the commissioner can mention the names of the authorities, trusts and boards that have been subject to investigation, although that has not always been so. That aspect of the amendment is, therefore, already covered in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (b) is important and deals with the length of time that the investigation takes. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that justice deferred is sometimes justice negated. The commissioner is concerned about the time that it takes to complete his investigations, although his annual report contains full statistics about the process. In his six-monthly reports—"epitomes"—he lists the length of time that each published investigation takes. He therefore provides a fairly full analysis of the time taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rightly said that the commissioner has not yet met the nine-month target. He would like to do so and I am sure that he will make improvements. He wants to be open about that and to make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the one item that is not included in the investigation report is a chronology of the dates in the investigation, although a chronology of the dates of the events under investigation is included? That is perhaps the one omission in the published data from which the Minister would not dissent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall draw that to the commissioner's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
Paragraph (a) deals with advertising the commissioner's role, which is as important as the length of time that investigations take. The commissioner wants to re-publish his information leaflet and will do so later this year to encompass the changes to be brought about by the Bill, which we hope will become an Act. He will make every effort to ensure that people are aware of the new facilities that will be available to them and mentioned his intentions in paragraphs 72 and 73 of his document, "Responsibilities of the Health Service Commissioner".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Gentleman's point, when he quoted from the Select Committee's report, that NHS staff did not know enough about the role of the ombudsman. I shall address that important point in a minute. The hon. Gentleman also pointed out that the filter of Members of Parliament did not always act in a way that helped people to understand the possibilities for them. Of course, there is not a filter of Members of Parliament in the case of the health commissioner and so, from the point of view of publicity and simplicity, the arrangements are more satisfactory than they are for the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in his other roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onus for publicising his role does not rest just with the ombudsman but with the Government as well. That is part of the three-stage package, which we want to ensure is explained properly, as a whole, to the public. To that end, the Government, as well as the ombudsman, will publish information leaflets which will be widely available throughout citizens advice bureaux, libraries, doctors' and dentists' surgeries and so on. We hope that they will explain our message clearly and forcibly, and in plain English—having been the Minister for plain English, I attach great importance to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, as I mentioned earlier in the proceedings, we will consider training manuals for NHS staff to ensure that they are able to explain clearly to people—so that they can hear it by word of mouth as well as via literature—what avenues are open to them under the new procedure. Further, we are planning a poster campaign to advise people of the new possibilities and to raise the general level of public awareness with regard to all the complaints procedures in the Bill and in stages 1 and 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will also hold eight regional seminars to explain to NHS staff and others what we are doing. One began earlier this month and the rest will proceed through January and February. I hope that members of the Committee will appreciate that that is a massive effort to get across to ordinary people the routes that will be available to them and to clear up and simplify what is possible. One of the criticisms that has been made—and I understand it—is that existing procedures are not only opaque but complex. We need to make clear to people what they can do in their various situations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will obviously draw some conclusions from his argument, but does he accept that, whereas he can tell us that now because we are in Committee, as the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood pointed out there is not an annual occasion on which to make that statement in the House, when it would be regarded, reported and well propounded? There is a good argument for a requirement for just that sort of information to be included in the annual report, so that people know where to look and can check new developments against the past year and make other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
comparisons. I hope, therefore, that it will lead the Minister to the conclusion that it should be included in amendment No. 18 or an amendment like it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making it clear that we are in agreement about what needs to be done. The question is what form we choose to make that effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may take that point together with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rotherham—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rother Valley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a territorial difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment of the hon. Member for Rother Valley particularly relates to a proposal for a consumer satisfaction survey. The aim is that the commissioner's intentions, following certain actions, should be clear. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey quoted the PCA Select Committee's recommendation that a consumer satisfaction survey should be undertaken. The commissioner has responded positively to that suggestion. Hon. Members will know that the local government commissioner has conducted a survey of the complaints that he has received. I do not know how successful that operation has been, but I know that the health service commissioner is examining that survey as he decides how he—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or she.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He or she. The health service commissioner is examining that survey as he or she decides how to organise a similar exercise. The hon. Member for Rother Valley can take it that the suggestion is quite a long way down the slipway towards enactment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also proposes that the regulations be changed as a result of the findings of such surveys. The hon. Gentleman will know, as the interesting comments that were made at yesterday's PCA Select Committee meeting about the role of the health service commissioner made clear, that there is an on-going debate about how the commissioner should respond to the criticisms and points that are made. That debate is right and proper. The commissioner's response to suggestions such as that of a consumer satisfaction survey will take note of that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main question is how the substantial points with which most hon. Members agree should be handled. The on-going debate between the PCA Select Committee and the commissioner has worked pretty well and has enabled hon. Members to make clear their views as to what should happen with the commissioner's reports. It is perfectly possible for Parliament to debate those reports whenever it wishes. That it has not done so is not a matter for the Government. Parliament can decide whether to stage a debate on the matter over half a day or a whole day. That is the right approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of historical accuracy it should be noted that the Select Committee has repeatedly asked the Government for annual debates on the reports
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
in Government time. That would be the appropriate way for time to be found for such a debate, but the Government have consistently refused those requests. They did so again in the past year. The Minister should acknowledge that the Government have not been especially helpful in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the Lord President. If the Opposition think that the Government's response has been unsatisfactory, they can, of course, use their own time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should we use our time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not? It would be very sensible. The Opposition could use their time for such a debate, although I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point that in the first instance it is a matter for the Lord President. However, as I pointed out earlier, we are heading for another period of quiet, competent government, so no doubt opportunities for such a debate will be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, since we are adding substantially to the health commissioner's remit, it may be appropriate for us to have another debate later when the new arrangements are in place. I shall mention to the Lord President that there may be an extra reason for having another debate if time allows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Putting aside the fact that there may be more time in the coming months for another debate, I am sure that the Minister will accept that any decision to provide for such a debate would be at the discretion of business managers and the usual channels. The danger is that it could fall by the wayside; another debate may not be salvaged. I hope therefore that the Minister can see the benefit of including certain provisions in the Bill to establish a routine that the public can use to check the work of the commissioner. There may be resistance to additional obligations but I am proposing obligations that have already been accepted. The public will understand that those obligations will be met regularly. That is the more persuasive approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an annual debate on the Public Accounts Committee, but its findings are not built into legislation. That debate is not a result of legislative fiat, but part of the custom and practice of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it might not take place, but it nearly always does. It is very rare for it not to be held; I cannot remember any occasion in recent years when it has not taken place, usually in November. Decisions on annual debates are often better left to the good sense of the House, though it is sometimes compromised through the usual channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Cannock and Burntwood and for Rother Valley spoke about good practice. An analogy was drawn with charters. Charter standards and targets have been developed, and the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey urged that the commissioner should adopt them. However, charters are not the subject of primary legislation. They develop most sensibly as a result of custom and practice built, stone by stone, as hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
Members debate issues and make comments in the House and in Committee. The proposals in the amendments are not, I conclude, appropriate matters for primary legislation, which is why I ask hon. Gentlemen to withdraw their amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree on good practice and we all want to build on it in the months to come. I shall be seeing the commissioner on Monday to discuss the Bill and I give hon. Members a specific promise to raise the issues posed by the amendments with the commissioner and elicit a response from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister comment on paragraph (6) of amendment No. 19, which deals with the commissioner meeting interested bodies such as patient associations or professional organisations? He could pass on messages about that to the commissioner on Monday and seek some response from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot promise what response I will receive but I can undertake to make the hon. Gentleman's point to the commissioner. There will be widespread interest in how the commissioner handles this crucial next stage of development. The commissioner is gaining a huge increase in his powers and his staff is more than doubling, so I suspect that he will be sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt the Minister's good faith. Does he agree with me—and will he put it on record—that irrespective of his advice on the amendments, he has no objection to the appropriate bodies being included in statute? The PCA Select Committee and the ombudsman, for example, have no such objection. No one objected to their being included in the Bill until the Minister did so on advice today. The arguments that the proposals should not be included but should be left to custom and practice are unsupported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument is that the proposals are not appropriate for primary legislation. Indeed, to try to legislate for good practice often makes matters worse. Good practice is sensibly developed by such means as we have already employed and which I undertake to continue. I shall raise the points made by the hon. Gentleman with the commissioner on Monday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I hope that the hon. Members for Rother Valley and for Southwark and Bermondsey will feel it appropriate to withdraw their amendments—I undertake to put across the spirit of their comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister came to the predicted conclusion to arguments overwhelmingly in support of the amendments tabled by the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is just as good as all those to which we just agreed—the Government simply did not think of it. The new clause provides not a separate regional ombudsman system, but regional officers. Like all the arguments put by Opposition Members, the proposal is supported by the evidence given to the PCA Select Committee before we reached the proceedings of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause makes our proposal clear. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Health Service Commissioner for England shall include among his officers officers who shall be based in each of the standard economic regions of England"—</p></blockquote>
I have taken the Government's definition—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and who shall have responsibility for the investigation of complaints arising in each such region."</p></blockquote>
I use the argument put by the commissioner—I draw attention to the evidence he gave on 26 May 1994 at page 146 and on 27 June 1994 at pages 148–9, which is brief and in which the argument is clearly put. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Report's proposal that I should be able to investigate the actions of GPs, dentists and so on … were to be accepted ultimately by the Government"—</p></blockquote>
as it has been—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that major extension of jurisdiction would have a significant effect on the staffing and organisation of the office. Some regional presence would seem essential if that were to happen; and the continuation of the HSC'S personal jurisdiction would be called in question."</p></blockquote>
I repeat:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some regional presence would seem essential".</p></blockquote>
It is not desirable, not on balance a good idea, not probably a good idea, but essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made it clear that the commissioner is fully aware that he must reorganise to cope with the work load and he wants to do that well. Members of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
Committee have every confidence that he will do as well as he can given the restrictions and the resources available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concluding paragraph of the appendices to the minutes of evidence, paragraph 14 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is axiomatic that widening of powers would affect the extent to which HSC could determine or even involve himself in every investigation."</p></blockquote>
I spent a relatively short, but formative period of my life working for the European Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The reality is that the commission does not do all the work: the minor officials, such as I, did most of the work; the commission had a supervisory role to ensure that we did our jobs properly. That is how this system works: the commissioner has a supervisory role, but most of the work is done by officers. It is worth recording what paragraph 14 makes clear:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is axiomatic that widening of powers would affect the extent to which HSC could determine or even involve himself in every investigation. He would need to set down criteria to guide those who would be responsible for screening complaints. Given the steady increase in complaints already within existing jurisdiction and probable responsibility from early 1995 for dealing with unresolved complaints about disclosure of information by NHS authorities, the inclusion within the remit of clinical complaints and the administrative actions of GPs and other family practitioners would make inescapable a marked increase in staff and accommodation—and probably the creation of regional offices."</p></blockquote>
There was a discussion about that between the Minister and the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood. The Government have accepted the value of such an administrative check on the administration of the NHS. They have set up integrated regional offices—that has nothing to do with regional government or with changing the powers of Parliament, which is another debate for another place and another time and was alluded to in the Chamber yesterday. The new clause is about including in the Bill the structure that the Government use for the standard economic regions and applying it to the ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have more confidence in a local investigator. That is one of the reasons why people have resisted a national police force: they prefer to have a West Mercia police force or a Northumberland police force or whatever. The ombudsman should have a local presence: a local office with local officers who know Leeds, Bradford, Newcastle, Bristol, Plymouth or whatever and who know the score. They would know the trusts and would deal with them day to day. That would give people confidence in the system and would be in line with what the commissioner wants. I hope that the Minister will accept the proposition and that the new clause is the ideal vehicle for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlemen's point is understandable. He is anxious that the commissioner should respond properly and efficiently to his new powers and he quoted the commissioner's observations about the need for a substantial reorganisations to meet the new responsibilities. The hon Gentleman also noted that the commissioner hinted that a regional presence might be inescapable and appropriate. Of course, there is already a presence in Scotland and Wales and the Scottish Office deals with cases that arise in the north of England. So, in practice, a degree of decentralisation of the commissioner's administrative burden already exists.

The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey made it clear that he had every confidence that the commissioner would proceed down that route. I shall draw the matter to the commissioner's attention when I see him on Monday, as it is important that the regions of England have confidence that the ombudsman understands the problems of the people who live in those areas, which can be different from those encountered by people in the south and in London. However, I repeat that I do not consider that to be a matter for primary legislation. Rather it is a matter for administrative and managerial good sense. The hon. Gentleman made it clear that he has every confidence in Mr. Reid's managerial good sense and ability to take appropriate measures. I share that confidence, and, in the light of those assurances, hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to show the ever-accommodating nature of hon.

The new clause was promoted by my original reading of the Bill. It was not clear whether health managers would be included in the new investigations into clinical judgment.

I can make the Minister an immediate and short offer. If he would undertake to see, on Monday, whether the commissioner would agree to my worthwhile proposition, which he has supported and continues to support, I should be happy to do the same deal that I did with new clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the record, the commissioner's supporting argument is in paragraph 5 of appendix 4 on page 144 of the minutes of evidence, which is the memorandum that was submitted by the commissioner on 26 May 1994. He points out that there will need to be more effective training, which builds on what the Minister said earlier. If the system is to work, the people who work in it must be trained and ready and the commissioner may be the best person to ensure that that is done properly. I hope that the Minister will try to facilitate the objective of new clause 3; if it can be done by arrangement outside the Bill, that is a fine starting point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I undertake to draw to the attention of the commissioner when I see him on Monday his own remarks, to which the hon.

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 would ensure that the draft report that has been prepared by the commissioner would be shown to both the body complained about and the complainant. That is an important part of the work that we are trying to enshrine in the Bill. It would give both sides the opportunity to correct any factual errors or omissions. The National Consumer Council would certainly like to see the new clause included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware, the body that is complained about has access to the draft report to enable it to draw attention to factual errors and omissions, but the person who is complaining does not. I therefore believe that complainants are not given an equal opportunity to put their views forward. In planning inquiries, anyone involved in any planning detail has to have a copy of what everyone else has said. That may be seen as time-consuming, but it is also fair. Everyone would see documents at around the same time and would have the same opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving complainants that opportunity will become more important in the future, when clinical judgments rather than just administrative matters become a feature of the health service commissioner's work. There could be a tendency for health bodies that are criticised to become even more critical of the complainant, but the complainant would not, at that time, have access to such information. I suggest that such reports are already good practice, and are operated by some ombudsmen, such as those for housing association tenants and for local government. In both cases, the reports of the ombudsmen provide the two sides of the argument but without giving any findings. That method would not only be even-handed but would be seen to be so, which is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another alternative might be for both sides to see the entire report, including the findings and recommendations. The danger is, however, that the ombudsman then becomes involved in negotiations about the findings and recommendations with just one side, which would not be ideal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will carefully consider my suggestion because it is an essential part of what we want to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members support the principle of the new clause. It is unfair that a complainant cannot see a draft report throughout the complaints procedure. If draft reports are in circulation, they should, in the spirit of transparency and even-handedness, be given to the person who initially brought the complaint. Opposition Members therefore support new clause 4, which would improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause is important. The ombudsman's draft reports are shown to the body against which a complaint has been made. That becomes extremely important when reports are finally examined by the Select Committee. When witnesses come before the Select Committee, there is much wriggling around. That is eventually resolved when they are reminded that they had
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
earlier agreed that the facts in the report were right, whatever conclusions were then reached. They have to admit that they saw and agreed to the draft and that removes any room for further argument about the facts of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service commissioner can now concern himself with clinical judgements, and it will clearly be a natural injustice if the body against which a complaint has been made can see the draft reports if the complainant cannot. That would be a source of massive dissension and confusion later. Although slight delays might result, it would be better for the different parties to see and agree the evidence before the commissioner delivers his conclusion. That is especially important now that medical advisors and assessors can submit reports. These cases are extremely difficult to resolve and, as every court case shows, the different sides can produce doctors who will testify in different ways about whether certain events took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complainants should be able to see the advice that professionals have tendered to the commissioner before he reaches his conclusion. It would be a natural injustice if that did not happen. The new clause is sensible and obvious and I hope that the Government will take it on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I offer just a few sentences in strong support of the new clause. If we want to ensure equity between the citizen and the state, both must be treated equally. The investigator and the person who seeks the investigation need to be treated in the same manner. That is the most obvious example because it is the last step before the conclusion of the proceedings and is, therefore, important to both sides, not just to one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sympathetic to the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock). The problem concerns how we proceed. My hon. Friend made the point that it would not necessarily be appropriate for a complainant to see the recommendations in a draft report—they could become a subject for negotiation or discussion between the complainant and the commissioner. The commissioner would not want complainants to see the recommendations—it would be wrong. All members of the Committee can probably understand why it would be wrong. Quite apart from the fact that it would greatly delay the making of the commissioner's report, it would not be right for a complainant to begin negotiations with the commissioner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is wrong in the case of the health service ombudsman, why is it right in the case of the Scott inquiry into the arms to Iraq affair? I bet that those people are discussing the report today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That precisely makes my point. It may be that Lord Justice Scott is reinforcing quiet, confident government by not showing any of his recommendations. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) made an important point which reinforces my comments to my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen. Were the new clause to be accepted, it would cover recommendations as well as facts and evidence and so would cause important problems which, I think, hon. Members would be unhappy about on reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must therefore ask whether the aim could be achieved in another way, and differently drafted, so that only the evidence—the facts—was presented to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
complainants enabling them to have a discussion. I can reassure my hon. Friend that the commissioner shows the draft of the facts to the complainant when the body complained about disputes them. In other words, where there is a purely factual difference of opinion between the complainant and the hospital trust or whatever, the trust's evidence is shown to the complainant and a resolution of the factual evidence agreed upon. Obviously, the commissioner wants there to be no doubt about the facts of any case—that could lead to differences in his recommendations. In practice, my hon. Friend's proposal is already covered by the commissioner. The facts which are ultimately published in the report are agreed, as far as they can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend's comments. He says that the evidence is shown to the complainant if the body complained about refers to inaccuracies. I would be happier were it shown as a matter of course rather than as a result of waiting for comments to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point but I think that she would, in all reasonableness, agree that little extra is gained by showing things as a matter of course if, in practice, they are shown when there is any disagreement on questions of fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister saying that the procedure applies only when the body complained against disputes the facts and that, if individual complainants do not see the facts of the case, they cannot dispute the facts? The new clause endeavours to ensure that complainants can see the draft so that both sides can dispute the evidence before them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see the logic of the hon. Gentlemen's comments. If there is no dispute about facts, there is no particular point in the complainant seeing them again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to ask how complainants know what is in the report, if they have not seen a copy. The report might contain facts that complainants would dispute, but they will not be seen. Only if the body complained against says that it disputes the facts will the complainant be allowed to see them, which cannot be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is acceptable. Where there is no difference about the facts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The complainants do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But they do. That is what they have complained about. It is stated in their evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The complainant has stated the evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But they have not seen it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have brought forward the evidence themselves and clearly indicated the nature of their complaint. If any factual elements are disputed by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
hospital trust, the commissioner will go back to the complainant and say that the trust has said one thing and the complainant another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what my hon. Friend is saying, but if I complain to a body, which says that it will complain on my behalf, I will not see what is put in the complaint. The complaint that is sent on may not entirely reflect my views. Perhaps I am cynical after 12 years in this place, but I know that if representations are made by local authorities to Ministers, they will not always represent exactly what the original complainant said. That is my worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, I undertake to draw my hon. Friend's views to the attention of the commissioner when I see him on Monday. I take the point and it will be a matter of concern to the commissioner. The best way for me to proceed is to take the matter up directly with him, and I shall take the report of today's proceedings with me when I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister finishes, I should like to draw his attention to what happens with the local government ombudsman in Wales. An organisation of about 12 dissatisfied complainants was recently set up to attempt to secure change in local government procedure. One of their main complaints was precisely this point—that the final report often includes evidence that they disputed. Because it was not directly related to the evidence that they initially presented, it was not included, and because they were not given an earlier draft, they had no opportunity to comment. Telephone calls were mentioned, as no documentation exists other than the fact that the call took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complainant needs to have confidence in how the ombudsman system operates, because I know from my experience of the local ombudsman in Wales, that complainants are already losing confidence. It would be a disaster for everyone if the same problem happened in the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that as an important point about which the Committee wants to make its feelings clear. I shall take up the matter as directly as I can on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen and I shall also ask the commissioner to look further into his practice in that regard. I will clarify whether it is satisfactory in his view and, indeed, whether it commands the confidence of others, which is immensely important. If the system is not commanding people's confidence, something is seriously wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend and the Committee to accept my assurance, which I give in good faith. I shall carry out my undertakings to the letter. I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw her new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his assurance. I accept that the new clause may be partly defective. I shall withdraw it in order to give him the opportunity to discuss those important aspects of the Bill with Mr. Reid. We shall return to the matter on Report.
