	<p>Amendment proposed [	<i>30 January</i>]: No. 5, in page 2, line 36, to leave out from the word `above;' to the end of line 39 and insert the words—</p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>`(c) it is delivered for home use as petrol which is suitable to be used as fuel for engines for which leaded petrol is suitable by virtue of being leaded; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) it is delivered for home use under such a description, or in such a manner, as tends, in the circumstances, to suggest that it is—
	<ol>
	<li>petrol satisfying the conditions set out in paragraph (a) above; or</li>
	<li>petrol suitable to be used as fuel for engines for which leaded petrol is suitable by virtue of being leaded.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>(1C) The method of testing unleaded petrol for ascertaining, for the purposes of this section, its research octane number or motor octane number shall be such as the Commissioners may direct."</p></blockquote>

	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have some technical trouble with the recording of the debate. I call upon hon. Members to speak clearly, and perhaps a little slower because our proceedings will be taken down in pure shorthand for a while. Having said that, I hope that the technician can get here to repair the recording equipment as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concluded my remarks about the amendment on Tuesday and I commend it and the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the clause, in its amended form, remove the fiscal incentive to buy super unleaded petrol instead of leaded four-star petrol? Members of the Committee do not know exactly what the Minister is proposing. I should be grateful if he could clarify his intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Super unleaded petrol falls into the category of unleaded petrol, which, for some years, has attracted a lower excise duty rate than leaded petrol. The lower rate was introduced deliberately to discourage the use of leaded petrol. The Government are satisfied that the use of super
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
unleaded petrol is low, and declining. As I mentioned earlier in the week, very few vehicles require it, they are getting older and, in due course, they will be scrapped. As I have already said, the use of super unleaded is therefore declining and as those vehicles are scrapped it will be phased out. In addition to that the greater use of catalytic convertors means that benzene emissions, which are associated with the use of super unleaded petrol, are already declining. The clause and the amendment forestall a potential greater use of super unleaded petrol by some companies by combining unleaded petrol with other mixtures to make it suitable for use in cars that use leaded petrol. As a result of our change, super unleaded petrol will bring in additional revenue and there will be associated environmental improvements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to detain the Committee, but the Minister's comments do not appear to correspond with what he said on Tuesday. I have a simple question. Is it the Government's intention to remove all fiscal incentives to buy super unleaded as against leaded four star petrol?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to repeat myself, but unleaded petrol attracts a duty rate less than that of leaded petrol. Therefore, the position remains exactly the same. I cannot repeat that again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to detain the Committee. Some years ago the Government introduced an incentive for people to buy unleaded petrol. That was a successful campaign. We have now discovered, however, that super unleaded petrol is being used, which has damaging consequences for health. I want to know whether the measures in clause 4 and the amendment moved by the Minister will remove entirely the incentive for using super unleaded petrol, because at present people are being encouraged by the taxation system to use such petrol. Are the Government intending through the amendment to remove completely the incentive to buy super unleaded petrol as against four-star petrol? I cannot ask a more simple question. I would like a simple yes or no answer to that question. Are the Government proposing to remove the incentive to buy super unleaded petrol as against leaded four-star petrol?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The price of fuels is not fixed by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tax is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tax element is designed to be an equaliser. I can give the hon. Gentleman no assurance that the market will deliver the price equality that he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards to the duty element, by equalising the gap we are moving towards removing the incentive for some petrol companies to use the status of super unleaded petrol to make it more attractive and suitable for cars that currently use leaded petrol. By doing that we can forestall the use and prevent the increase in use
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
of super unleaded petrol. That means that associated benzene emissions will be removed from the environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome clause 4. The idea of putting up tax on petrol and diesel seems environmentally sound. It would be even more environmentally sound if more attention was paid to promoting public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of the clause relates to road fuel gas, a tax that applies to cars as well as buses. The use of such road fuel gas is one development that we would like to see promoted by the clause. The other development relates to diesel but before I talk about the tax on diesel, I should make it clear that I support the tax changes as they relate to cars. In the past three years, however, tax rises have also affected public transport with the effect that the tax increases relating to diesel are now much higher than those relating to cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members recall that until 1993 buses doing local journeys received a rebate for the diesel fuel tax paid and until then paid no duty at all. Following the 1993 Budget, the duty rate on diesel per litre was 2.56p. The following year it went up to 5.3p per litre—an increase of 107 per cent. A year later the tax went up 6.18p—a further increase of 17 per cent. This year, the tax is set at 9.16p—an increase of 48 per cent. That represents a massive increase in the duty paid by public transport as well as by cars. The fact that public transport will be faced with a tax of more than 9p this year will cause serious problems for bus companies. That does not seem to me to be a sensible way to encourage public transport use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Chancellor introduced the 1993 Budget in which he proposed his environmental measures, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any critic of the Government's tax plans who claims also to support the international agreement to curb carbon dixoide emissions will be sailing dangerously near to hypocrisy"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 30 November 1993; vol.233,c.937]</p></blockquote>
As we all know, the word hypocrisy is used rather loosely by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are aware, the freezing of the fuel rebate for buses made public transport more expensive and therefore less attractive to people. That was not taken into account by the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in touch with representatives of Lothian Regional Transport and they have told me that their fuel costs have risen by 53 per cent. and that they now stand at £4.5 million—an increase of more than £1.5 million in the past two years. That has created problems because those costs are passed on in higher bus fares and other additional costs. If the Government are serious about being green and encouraging public
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
transport, they need to look again at the rebate for public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument in favour of the change used at the time of the 1993 Budget was that the tax would be an incentive for people to use fuel efficient vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, some of the additions required to make engines more environmentally friendly also, unfortunately, make them less fuel efficient. The Government's argument at the time was not particularly sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more desirable than reducing the diesel rate for buses would be to introduce measures to encourage buses to convert to using road fuel gas. Cars could also convert to that. The most disappointing aspect of the clause is that even after the proposed decrease of 15 per cent., the cost of road fuel gas and petrol and diesel will be roughly the same. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs, especially if we want vehicles to be converted to use road fuel gas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Budget, road fuel gas duty was at 400 per cent. of the minimum level stipulated by the European Union. There is obviously room to offer more incentives to get the market for road fuel gas off the ground. Many other EU countries have already ensured that the gas duty is at the minimum level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some calculations have been done that identify that to convert a small or medium-sized vehicle to run on gas would cost around £2,000. The duty rate for gas and diesel are currently at similar levels—about 5.09p per mile for diesel and 5.03p for gas. Assuming parity of fuel prices, it has been calculated that it would take 3.8 million miles to offer a simple payback to operators to cover the conversion investment. That is no incentive. It has been calculated that if the duty were reduced to the EU minimum level, operators would receive a payback from conversion within two to three years. That represents a good incentive to operators and would apply to cars and buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One major European city has converted its bus fleet to run on natural gas. I was told that by some councillors from Lothian region who went over to Austria recently. Lothian region is a environmentally sound Labour council and it has taken many positive steps to improve the environment and transport facilities. Those councillors thought that they might suggest to their counterparts in Vienna that they should consider converting their bus fleets to natural gas, which Lothiana region is considering. They were rather stunned when those councillors in Vienna told them that they did that in 1978. All the Viennese bus fleet runs on natural gas. The significant fact for our purposes is that no tax is levied on liquid gas for public transport use. The price of diesel is four times the price of liquid gas in Austria because of that tax measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should consider that Austrian example and encourage the development of that environmentally clean mode of transport. I am sure that hon. Members are aware of the advantages of natural gas against petrol and diesel—carbon monoxide emissions are lower by 76 per cent. as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
against petrol and diesel; nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 80 per cent; non-methane hydrocarbons by 80 per cent.; carbon dioxide emissions are reduced, albeit by smaller amounts, but they are still significant; and benzene emissions are reduced by more than 90 per cent. There are many environmental improvements to be had from such conversions to natural gas. I hope that the Government will be more bold in subsequent Budgets—if they have any—and encourage such conversions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pick up on the concluding remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an incontestable fact that the Government talk green but act dirty. We have already heard about the buses in Edinburgh. In 1944, the Government made a piddling grant of £116,000 towards the conversion of 16 buses to alternative fuel. Given the scale of the environmental pollution problem that is hardly an adequate response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome the clause, it does not go far enough. Other fuels such as city diesel, low lead petrol and oxygenated petrol should be given benefits through the tax system to encourage people to use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
City diesel is currently used by Sainsbury. I do not hold any brief for Sainsbury, although I shop at its stores occasionally. It costs that company to run its trucks and vehicles on city diesel, but it bears that cost because it is concerned about the environment in inner cities where so many of its stores are located.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Government precisely doing to encourage people to use environmentally friendly fuels? The 1995 annual report on the United Kingdom's sustainable development strategy entitled, "This Common Inheritance", reveals that it was the Government's objective to improve and extend guidance on fuel economy and to publicise the links between fuel use and the environment. The document also reveals that a "Greener Motoring Forum" was set up in 1994. I should like to know from the Minister precisely what has emerged from that forum. That document also reveals that it is the Government's policy objective to continue to help in the development of less polluting vehicle technology. Research will also be conducted into more efficient and less polluting engine design. The document also reveals that in 1994 the Government
	<br><blockquote><p>"Completed reviews on alternative engines and alternative fuels."</p></blockquote>
I find it surprising that, given that that study was completed in 1994, the 1995 Budget contains just one measure—which we welcome—on road fuel gas. There is a deafening silence about the other fuels that I mentioned earlier. I hope that the Minister will respond to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that fiscal policies can influence environmental
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
behaviour. That is best illustrated by the way in which the reduction in duty on unleaded petrol has dramatically changed the state of the market, drivers' attitudes, and so on. I very much welcome that and I also welcome the change in the clause which reduces the duty on natural gas. I am not sure that we will be able to persuade many car drivers to convert to natural gas. I do not believe that it is practical for motor cars, but for small commercial vehicles which operate in city areas, including small buses, it is extremely practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether the change in the clause goes for enough to provide a sufficient fiscal incentive for people to invest in gas driven vehicles. It has been put to me by the Natural Gas Vehicle Association that the reduction is not sufficient. We shall soon find out because this change is already in place. I hope very much that my right hon. Friend will monitor the effect of the change in the Bill and if it is not sufficient that he will suggest to the Chancellor that in the next Budget a further substantial reduction is made. That would be a desirable change. I fully support the objectives behind the reduction in the Bill, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) who wishes to be associated with what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also briefly wish to mention the question of the tax on diesel. Diesel is generally though to be pretty unpleasant. I think that that would be the view of anyone; of the man on the Clapham omnibus. But, as the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) has just said, it is possible, to buy diesel which is more environmentally friendly and which spews out fewer particulates into the atmosphere. As he mentioned, Sainsbury is keen to promote city diesel. I understand that it sells it on all its forecourts. It is effectively subsidising it because it costs 3.5p per litre more than ordinary diesel and it sells it at 2p more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sainsbury submits that, in the same way as we encourage environmentally friendly petrol by a lower rate of duty, we should now encourage environmentally friendly diesel. That seems like a good argument and I hope that my hon. Friend will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the points that have just been made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). If taxes and reductions in tax are to be introduced on the basis that they encourage people to behave in a more environmentally friendly manner—as the case for unleaded fuel has demonstrated—we need to be clear that the changes that we make will assist the change in behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we welcome the cut in the duty on gas as a road fuel in the Budget, we must presume that the reason for the cut is to encourage the use of that fuel, particularly among the large fleet operators, because public transport, not just small buses, can convert to using gas. As we know, large vehicles more than 10 years old—which unfortunately includes buses in most fleets—contribute the majority of pollution and lower the air quality. Given that air quality is, rightly, so high on all or political agendas, scrutinising proposals,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
particularly on gas—although on other fuels as well—is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is whether the change will ensure the long-term viability of gas-powered vehicles in the UK market. The Natural Gas Vehicle Association has suggested that the duty cut needs to be as great as 70 per cent. I cannot comment on whether its figures are exactly right, but there is a big gap between 70 per cent. and the 15 per cent. proposed in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the aim of the duty cut is to equalise the price of the compressed natural gas with that of petrol and diesel to vehicle users, after taking into account the extra cost of delivering the compressed natural gas vehicles, we need to know whether it will make any difference in encouraging that conversion. In particular, we need to know from the Government what their plans are to provide greater incentives to fleet operators in order to obtain the full environmental benefits of using gas vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, the precedent for using such a mechanism was clearly set with the policy on unleaded fuel. In Bristol a 35-seater, single-decker, gas driven bus went into service on 4 January. The Minister for Transport in London, the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris), was there to wish it luck and to ensure that people understood that the Government were committed to environmentally friendly policies. But a single-decker, 35-seater bus costs £45,000 more than if it is using gas. Therefore, the incentives for a company to move to a fleet, as opposed to having just one, allowing it to claim that it has some environmentally friendly credentials, are clearly important. The impact of that duty change needs to be measured against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider what is happening elsewhere in Europe. While duty on petrol and diesel is set closely to the European Union minimum, the duty on natural gas in Britain is currently 340 per cent. of the recommended European Union minimum. There is a lot of room for us to improve our performance. The Treasury Budget press release stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Vehicles using road fuel gases emit lower levels of most major pollutants than petrol and diesel vehicles."</p></blockquote>
The Customs and Excise news release of the same day said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The duty on road fuel gases is being reduced because they will produce markedly fewer emissions of important pollutants."</p></blockquote>
That clearly implies that the Government expect the 15 per cent. reduction, which the industry says is inadequate, to assist in encouraging people, particularly commercial vehicle owners, to move to gas fuels.

The Environment Select Committee report on volatile organic compounds also recommended that we should give great assistance to vehicles using natural gas fuels. On sustainable development, it concluded that the current tax treatment of natural gas as a road fuel merits early revision. I do not think that the 15 per
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
cent. reduction is necessarily the type of reduction that we want to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that there is a disagreement between what the Treasury thinks will change behaviour and what the industry believes, what steps will the Government take to monitor their current policy? Why was such a small reduction settled on? What justification, research and background information informed the decision that a 15 per cent. cut would be good enough? If the Government consider that that cut is not large enough, and that a greater reduction is to be phased in, could that policy be explained to us? Over what period will that phasing of duty cuts occur? The industry will then have some understanding of the requirements, because the technology exists to develop buses, haulage vehicles and even cars to use the natural gas. That opportunity will not be seized if no fiscal assistance is offered. What is the reduction contained in the Bill intended to achieve?

Will the growth in gas vehicles be monitored by the Treasury? If there is a growth, will it be able to assess the extent to which that is a result of the Budget's duty reduction? Will the Treasury be able to quantify that impact on the market? If not, why not? If the Government cannot give that answer, why have they settled on 15 per cent. reduction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Government's future plans for the use of natural gas, bio-diesels, oxygenated fuels and other environmentally friendlier fuels? Given the valuable mechanism designed to encourage the use of unleaded fuel, what measures are being considered to encourage people in the future to change to more environmentally friendly fuel? If those questions cannot be answered, perhaps the Paymaster General can explain whether the Government have a coherent policy on transport and fuels, or whether they intend to make a haphazard stab at a few areas in order to attach a green label to themselves. The impact on the environment of such a policy would be negligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I can confirm to the hon.

In some cases, an additional subsidy is provided by local authorities. That sector of public transport is still greatly helped directly through the duty system.

Several hon. Members have asked about road fuel gases. The duty rate was frozen last year and, as a result of the Bill, it will he cut by 15 per cent. That has been done because there is an indisputable environmental advantage from the greater use of those fuels in that the emissions from almost all the major pollutants will be reduced. If we can control methane leakages from the distribution network there will be a clear overall environmental gain. I mention the possibility of leakages not because they are prevalent in this country, but they illustrate that there is no magic fuel. The combustion of all fuels has environmental disadvantages. There is no one fuel that we can unerringly promote as solving all our problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We concluded that the advantage of road fuel gases, both natural gas and liquified petroleum gas, justified the significant duty reduction announced this year. It now faces a duty of about half of that applying to diesel and petrol. As I have said before, it is difficult to predict exactly how the market price will respond to any duty alteration. In approximate terms, however, we hope that the running costs between petrol diesel and the use of road fuel gases will approximately equalise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction marks a new and important departure. I hope that there will be a corresponding uptake in the use of road fuel gases. Any dramatically larger cut would have benefited the high mileage user of those fuels, but the main environmental advantage from their greater use probably accrues to urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversion costs have been mentioned. I can assure the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) that such matters are kept under review. The Chancellor announced in his Budget statement that the use of vehicle excise duty as a possible means of promoting low polluting vehicles would be studied. That may be a way of additionally helping towards the conversion of vehicles to use road fuel gases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and others mentioned city diesel. It has the advantage of containing little sulphur, but to echo a point I have already made, it is not a magic fuel. There is a penalty attached to its use because its production involves increased energy use. The environmental impact of its production and use is associated with higher carbon dioxide emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
I must remind my hon. Friend that any big increase in demand for that fuel through a duty privilege would have to be satisfied chiefly from increased imports. It is used mostly in Scandinavia. We would prefer to bring in tighter emission standards to apply to the entire category of diesel fuel. That will happen later this year when the standard for ordinary diesel will reduce sulphur levels significantly. Rather than picking out one particular type of diesel and giving it a duty advantage we would rather tighten emission controls generally in order to improve the general environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend confirm that the fuel is imported from Scandinavia because those Scandinavian countries have reduced the duty on environmentally friendly diesels? As a result, in Sweden, 100 per cent. of diesel used is city diesel. Surely if demand rose here, that fuel could be produced here instead of in Scandinavia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but we would rather tool up the United Kingdom's refining industry to produce lower sulphur diesel anyway. We should like to do that through the introduction of non fuel specific standards—I have already said that such standards are coming into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In anticipation of those revised standards, certain fuel companies have already put on to the market lower sulphur products. So we are already getting the environmental advantage, without having to give away a duty reduction in order to try to identify one particular fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can be certain of one thing, which is that the market is dynamic, a number of products are coming forward and being tested and it is certainly premature, and probably generally unwise, for the Government, at least at this stage, to try to identify one product—city diesel, or whatever—and give that a duty cut in this category of diesel fuel. I can assure my hon. Friend that a further tightening of the sulphur emission standards is in prospect without the need for a duty cut aimed directly at that product which is imported from Scandinavia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of clause 6, relief from duty applies to all mineral oils used by commercial vessels during marine voyages. The main beneficiaries of the concession and clause 6 are small petrol-driven boats used in diving support, marine surveying and commercial transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause replaces an extra-statutory concession, which is desirable in itself. It is always better to put those things into law. It extends the duty relief which has up to now been available for heavy oil, or diesel commercial vehicles, to include, from now on, similar petrol-powered craft. The sort of vessels that will be helped are those operated by fish farms, or diving support vessels, and other similar craft used by commercial operators. It will not extend to pleasure craft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simplifying measure in that it extends a concession more rationally, to include all such small powered craft used in these waters, regardless of whether they fall into the previous category. For instance, there was no particularly good reason to exclude those visiting and servicing fish farms to which the concession was already extended rather than similar commercial vehicles used in other ways.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certain problems are being experienced with duty-paid tobacco products. There is a substantial increase in smuggled tobacco products, in particular, hand rolled tobacco. The Chancellor acknowledged that difficulty in the Budget by freezing the duty on hand rolled tobacco. I also seek some clarification on the threat to cigarettes and the Government's policy on this area in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report to the chairman of Customs and Excise 1994–95—it is from the south Wales and the Borders collection executive unit, but it is not unusual in what it has to say—at page 8, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Large scale cigarette smuggling was a significant development towards the year end."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
We are aware from information from the tobacco industry that exceptional difficulties are being experienced as a result of the taxes on hand rolling tobacco. In the United Kingdom those taxes are the highest in Europe at £5.40 on a 500 g pouch, more than four times higher those of continental neighbours, such as Belgium, where it is £1.13. The closeness of Belgium and the huge variation in the duty levels, which affect the price of the product, create an opportunity for smuggling on a scale that is intolerable for health and revenue reasons and for policing reasons in terms of the development of criminal activity and fraud in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Smuggling of that product increased by 50 per cent. last year, with a substantial revenue loss to the Government which would otherwise have been obtained had the products been purchased here for consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not advocating smoking, but I want to make it clear that we are concerned about the duty rates because of their implications for health, tax—by which I mean revenue to the Exchequer—and policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most frequently quoted product in the handrolling tobacco market is called Drum—I could not name any of them. Drum is not legitimately sold in the United Kingdom, but more than 11 per cent. of the population who smoke apparently smoke it most often. It is the third most popular brand for hand rolling tobacco, but it is not even sold here legally. Unless an awful lot of our citizens, instead of going to the corner shop, are going to Belgium to purchase their tobacco, I can only assume that it is coming into the country by another means. The United Kingdom manufacturers sell to Europe, so they are not losing anything and are protecting their profit. They know full well that their products will come back into the United Kingdom. The British tobacco industry sales to Belgium increased fourfold in 1995. Unless the Belgians have suddenly developed an enormous preference for smoking hand rolled tobacco, it is unlikely that that product is being domestically consumed in Belgium. It represents a third of the smuggled volume coming back into this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consumption of hand rolling tobacco in the United Kingdom is increasing because smokers are migrating—I am not sure that that is the right term—to cheaper continental tobacco, which is becoming widely available. It is also interesting to note that sales of hand rolling cigarette papers in the United Kingdom were stable until the relaxation of border controls and the establishment of the single market in 1993. Since then, those sales have increased significantly. Some people say that sales are eight times greater than the necessary number if one measures the sale of cigarette papers against the equivalent legitimate sale of hand rolling tobacco. Unless those cigarette papers are being used to smoke something else, it is highly likely that they are being used to smoke hand rolled tobacco smuggled into the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duty paid in the United Kingdom on hand rolling tobacco sales has consistently and dramatically
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
fallen since 1992. The difference is mainly due to smuggling. It is now estimated that between 50 and 60 per cent. of all hand rolling tobacco smoked in this country is smuggled in. That is devastating. Why bother operating duty rates if such a large proportion of that product avoids paying that duty? I am not arguing for a moment that we should not have duty rates—I am firmly in favour of them—but we need to establish a policy to ensure that our duty rates are not totally undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seizure figures from Her Majesty's Customs and Excise show that in the 12 months up to June 1994, hand rolling tobacco accounted for 60 per cent. of all seizures. In every respect that means that a huge amount of such tobacco is coming into the country without proper control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Illegal distribution networks have been established for the sale of that illegal product. I am sure that all hon. Members are aware that their constituents have access to such smuggling rings, which offer products much cheaper than the legal price because their operating budgets are tight. One can hardly blame those rings for taking advantage of the opportunity. It is up to the Government to ensure that that illegal opportunity is denied. What is worrying is that now that those networks are established they could easily be extended to smuggle cigarettes. The profit margin may not be as great for cigarettes, but it is still large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us stop for a minute to think of the people involved in that illegal activity. It is clearly becoming an intense criminal activity, with all the attendant social problems. We are by no means the only country in Europe to suffer from those problems. 	<i>Time</i> magazine carried an article on 15 January detailing the gang warfare that has developed on the streets of Berlin. It described the awful prospect of those products being openly sold because the profits are so high. Rival gangs are therefore slogging it out for control of the markets in those lucrative products, and there appear to have been several gunfights in the past month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that we are about to enter a period of such intense confrontation between people trying to secure that illegal market, but the foundations for it are already in place. A freeze on the duty for hand rolling tobacco does not deal with the problem. A number of other solutions must be found, involving detection, the penalties that are imposed and the number of Customs officers deployed at the points of entry and in the collection of intelligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another consequence of the illegal smuggling of tobacco is the undermining of our health policy. We of course do not agree with the Government that increasing taxation is the only way to encourage people not to smoke. We have made it clear that we think that a ban on advertising is also necessary. Unfortunately, although the products carry health warnings and legislatures try to encourage people not to smoke and to provide them with information, the widespread availability of such products badly undermines our health policy—especially among
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
teenage smokers, who find the product cheap and easily available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>The Guardian</i> reported at the end of 1995—I chose the report at random—new figures for teenage smoking. The report showed a sharp increase particularly among 11 to 15-year olds, especially young women. If the Government agree with the industry that that is a significant problem, and if we also agree that we do not want to abandon our health policies of using taxation, education and the possibility of a ban on advertising, we should agree too that an additional strategy is needed to deal with this severe problem before it goes out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although all that has been acknowledged by the Chancellor, there has still been no clear statement from the Government on how they intend to reduce the risks year on year while maintaining a clear policy of trying to persuade people either not to start smoking or, if they already smoke, to consider giving up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for reassurance from the Paymaster General that the Government have a strategy and for a clear outline of exactly what it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a severe problem with illegal imports, particularly of hand rolling tobacco. Most of us could agree with what the hon. Member for Bristol, South said about what is happening in our constituencies—especially those of us with constituencies in the south-east, where the smuggling is easiest. We have already debated the problems to do with smuggling beer from the continent; the problems with hand rolling tobacco are much worse, in terms of the substitution of smuggled tobacco for domestically-bought products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate to note that there is probably little hope of stopping the smuggling, except by bringing the price of tobacco on the continent into line with the price of domestic tobacco. And the only way of doing that is to ensure that taxes on tobacco products are the same across the European Union, or at least are close enough to remove the benefits of smuggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many reasons—mostly associated with health—few of us want the tax dramatically reduced in this country. So my question to the Minister is this: what progress is being made in the EU to ensure that countries such as France and Belgium adopt similarly progressive attitudes to the taxation of tobacco products?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the effects of importing hand rolling tobacco are dramatic for the industry, but it is not just tobacco manufacturers who suffer. The real sufferers are the newsagents. Those small retailers rely on people going into their shops to buy tobacco products who then buy other goods as well. In central London, such shops provide a social service as well as a commercial service, and the damage to their trade has rendered their survival rather precarious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise an associated—although perhaps not so serious—problem which I suspect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
commands less popular sympathy: the problem of high-priced cigars. A major importer of high-priced cigars located in my constituency has been hit badly by the price differences between Europe and this country. The problem is even worse than with hand rolling tobacco because people tend not to consume a large number of high-priced cigars. They might like to, but I am told that they generally smoke one or two of them a week. It is thus perfectly possible to go on holiday with no intention of smuggling, to keep within the limits that we have set for importing such cigars for personal consumption—and then to bring back enough to last from one holiday to the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The price difference is so dramatic that it is worth buying a box of 50 high-priced cigars from say, Belgium or Switzerland and bringing them home here for personal consumption. That badly affects employment, the industry and the specialist retailers—and the problem is getting worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Minister to look seriously at the possibility of viewing the taxation of high-priced cigars and cigars in general in the same way as we view the taxation of hand rolling tobacco. More importantly, we should put pressure on our European partners to come to an arrangement over the equalisation of excise duty on tobacco products across the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South gave us a number of statistics. Perhaps the Paymaster General can confirm that, in 1992, 3,841 tonnes of hand rolling tobacco were imported; and that in 1995, 2,650 tonnes were imported—a decline of about 30 per cent. Similar but opposite figures apply to the sale of cigarette papers. In 1992, 260 million booklets of cigarette papers were sold; in 1995, 330 million booklets were sold—an increase of about 30 per cent. So the sale of hand rolled tobacco has declined by 30 per cent. in the past three years, but sales of booklets have increased by 30 per cent. That clearly shows that smuggling is taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying issue, of course, is the grave disparity between United Kingdom rates of taxation and the rates applied by our continental partners. Hand rolled tobacco in the UK is taxed at the highest rate in the European Union, and our cigarettes are the second highest rated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) also pointed out, small independent retailers of tobacco face real problems. A survey of corner shop users has shown that a third of them have been approached to buy smuggled tobacco. I do not know whether other hon. Members have received postcards from an organisation called the Fair Cigarette Tax Campaign, but I get bundles of them every day. The campaign claims that our rates of taxation are too high. Meanwhile, I have done some research of my own and have used a computer analysis of my constituency to
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
find out where the cards are coming from. Interestingly they appear to come from the least affluent areas—areas of deprivation in fact. People at the lowest end of the income spectrum are behind the campaign. The reasons for that have to do with how excise rates on tobacco affect the rich and the poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the top 10 per cent. of households, rated by average incomes, spend 0.3 per cent. of their money on tobacco taxes, whereas the bottom 10 per cent. spend 11 per cent. That explains the origin of the postcards. It is why I believe that tobacco taxes are inequitable, affecting people at the bottom of the income tax scale more than those at the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Paymaster General to sort out the issue today, but this matter certainly needs further work and research. It is quite wrong to make the poorest people pay disproportionately more of their incomes in taxation. I hope that the Minister will agree to look into the problem in future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives effect to a commitment to increase tobacco duties by an average of at least 3 per cent. a year in real terms. That increase in the tax, and hence the price, has been an important element in keeping the consumption of tobacco falling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is recognised that a smuggling problem is associated particularly with hand rolling tobacco. I remind the Committee, though, that there are other ways in which hand rolling tobacco can find its way into this country, not all of them illegal. So hon. Members will be ill advised to try a citizens arrest on someone smoking this tobacco, even though it is not legally on sale in this country. It is entirely legal for someone to shop abroad and bring back a quantity of hand rolled tobacco for his own use, provided he does not resell it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also known, however, that considerable quantities of this type of tobacco are smuggled in, partly because it is easily transported: it can be crushed or compressed, unlike packets of cigarettes. From the point of view of the smuggler, it also has the advantage of not carrying a prominent health warning of the kind printed in a foreign language on a cigarette package, thus making the latter much more difficult to resell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham rightly pointed out that this is a problem not just for the revenue but for traders, small retailers and newsagents. He correctly said that the cost of equalising our duty rates with those on the continent would be prohibitive. Additionally, even if we were to equalise we would not necessarily end smuggling, because continental countries with much lower rates of tobacco taxation still suffer from duty fraud and smuggling from outside the EU. That is a real problem in Germany with smuggled tobacco from eastern Europe, and in southern Europe, with cheap imports from non-European Union Mediterranean countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have pressed in the forum of the European Union for other countries at least to implement a cash floor in the duty on cigarettes, and to bring in higher minimum rates for hand rolling tobacco.

This is a slow and difficult process, and we are disappointed by the Commission's failure, in its biennial review, to produce any definite proposals. Other member states quite rightly have fiscal sovereignty in this area, and we cannot compel them to raise their domestic duty rates. I assure the Committee that we will continue to press for higher minimum duty rates in those proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not overlook the other problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, which affects the market for larger cigars. I am aware that that market, too, has been hit by imported products, but I think my hon. Friend would agree that it would be very difficult, technically and politically, to try to exempt a luxury imported product smoked by a comparatively small sector of the population. I cannot therefore offer my hon. Friend any prospect of relief in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South was careful not to advance the proposition that duty should be cut in this area. It was not clear from her remarks what she wanted us to do that we are not already doing. We take the problem of smuggling and of illegality very seriously. During the 12 months ending 31 August 1995, Customs recorded 1,700 seizures involving about 35.5 tonnes of hand rolling tobacco. That is a very high and successful rate of interception, but I do not underestimate the scale of the problem. As I described in a debate earlier this week, we have deployed additional staff where the risk exists. Within the duty structure we are doing what we can to counter the menace of illegal smuggling. The fact that we have frozen the rate for hand rolling tobacco shows that we are responding to an acknowledged menace by fiscal means as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 4, line 30, leave out from 'substituted' to end of line 35 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>`"26.50 per cent" in relation to bets the stake money on which has been or is paid on or after 3rd December 1995.'.</p></blockquote>
The clause reduces the pools betting duty from 32.5 per cent. to 27.5 per cent. as from 3 December 1995, and to 26.5 per cent.—a further 1 per cent. cut—as from 5 May 1996. The latter cut is conditional on the pools operators agreeing to pass on the 1 per cent. to the Football Trust and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cut to 26.5 per cent. will cause a reduction of revenue to the Treasury. The amendment would bring forward that 1 per cent. cut so that the contribution to the Football Trust and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts could be made immediately. In that connection, I am thinking of the good work that the Football Trust
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
undertakes an implementing the recommendations of the Taylor report on safety in football grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to put the pools betting duty in the context of the other products and opportunities for gambling available to members of the public. Pools betting duty has been reduced by 5 per cent. in each of the past two Budgets, in response to the impact on the industry of the national lottery—the national lottery pays just 12 per cent. taxation on its portfolio products. In the past year especially, numerous representations have been made to the Treasury and to Members of Parliament concerning the problems experienced by the pools industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter from Vernons Pools. Its comments are not unusual. It says that in 1995 turnover was more than 30 per cent. down on 1994, which resulted in a third of its work force being made redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lottery market is worth about £5 billion a year; the pools market about £600 million a year. The debate on how to achieve a level playing field will continue beyond today's discussions. I am sure that the companies involved will make their case clearly to the Treasury.

The amendment concerns the money that will be transferred to the Football Trust. It is a relatively minor measure. When the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, now Prime Minister, announced the first 2.5 per cent. reduction for the Football Trust in his 1990 Budget, the trust assumed that it would have to wait for the funds under a mechanism similar to this one; but in the course of negotiations with officials in the Treasury it was told that the payments would be backdated to the date of the Budget. That is not the case this time, but it would be of tremendous help if the same approach were used again. That is what the amendment is designed to ensure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year the Football Trust produced a report on the decline in its income since the introduction of the national lottery, and on the consequent impact on its ability to implement the Taylor report right through to the end of the decade. Smaller clubs, in particular, are affected. The trust has identified a probable minimum shortfall of about £15 million—a considerable amount that could be spent on improving safety at football grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By bringing the 1 per cent. cut into immediate effect we would ensure that the trust received the money to enable it to continue its good work and its important social contribution to enhancing the safety of spectators at sports grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his Budget statement, my right hon. and learned Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that pools betting duty would be cut again. The Committee will recall that it was cut last year; and the Chancellor proposed a further 5 per cent. cut this year, which took effect from 3 December 1995. He also somewhat unexpectedly said that the duty rate might be cut by a further 1 per cent. with effect from Royal Assent, provided that it was agreed by the pools promoters that the extra 1 per cent. would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
be shared between the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and the Football Trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Committee members will be familiar with those two bodies and with the good work that they do in helping to upgrade football stadiums and supporting and subsidising a range of artistic and sporting events. Thus my right hon. and learned Friend was anxious that the additional 1 per cent. be passed straight to these bodies. I am pleased to say that the three major pools companies—Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters—have agreed to do that, so I can advance the clause once we get to that part of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not invite the Committee to accept the amendment and to backdate the agreement—that is certainly not expected or necessary, and of course it would cost money. Labour Front Benchers are catching the Liberal Democrat disease of proposing duty revisions and tax cuts without any regard to the overall budgetary arithmetic. The hon. Member for Bristol, South did not say whether the lost revenue would be made up by tax increases or public expenditure reductions. In the absence of any clarity on that and in the light of what I have said, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government did not tell us where the money was coming from when they raised the ceiling on executive share options. As the Paymaster General seems unfamiliar with the revenue flowing into the Treasury, we suggest to him that the unexpectedly high returns from the national lottery—exceeding, as they admit, the Government's wildest dreams—would more than compensate for a modest measure providing for improved safety and investment for sports grounds. That would be greatly appreciated by local communities, and it would enable Parliament to continue to fulfil its commitment to implementing the Taylor report's proposals to enhance safety measures at football grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given us no reason why the measure cannot be backdated by the short period of six months so as to release these modest funds. When the time comes, therefore, we shall press our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I heard the Paymaster General say that the amendment was not necessary. I wonder whether he has held discussions with the Football Trust or the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. He may know that the former is looking at a shortfall over the next five years—depending on whether we use 1993 figures or last year's figures—of between £15 million and £30 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Football Trust has done an enormous amount of good work. I know from my discussions with people who work for the Foundation for Sport and the Arts what valuable work it has done and what problems it has faced owing to the introduction of the national lottery. The FSA has greatly enhanced the activities of many organisations and clubs, but is facing real

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise some issues stemming from the clause's omission of bingo duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget proposed to reduce betting duty in recognition of the impact of the lottery. No action was taken, however, to assist the bingo industry, despite the severe impact of the lottery on clubs across the country. Research shows that bingo players spend double the national average playing the lottery. This is leading to a significant drop in admission figures and in the industry's turnover. Bingo clubs deserve treatment and assistance similar to that given to other parts of the betting industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bingo industry employs 35,000 people and 3 million players regularly play the game. The impact of the lottery is clear. Beacon Entertainments, which is based in the Chancellor's constituency, wrote to him on 29 November 1995 to show the impact of the Budget's omissions on its club. The club has more than 10,000 members and employs 40 staff. Its manager states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was astonished to hear that in your recent budget, whilst you stated that the gaming industry had been hit by the lottery, you only saw fit to reduce taxes on Pools and horse racing. We, in the bingo industry, have arguably been hit worse than most."</p></blockquote>
The manager goes on to say that the club's turnover is significantly down, and continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are desperate for some help from the Government to help us survive".</p></blockquote>
The Government recognise the impact of the lottery on every part of the betting industry apart from bingo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bingo has 3 million regular players—a high proportion of the population—but for many players the social aspect of clubs is as important as playing the game. Bingo relies on admissions to be able to offer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
attractive prizes. Lower admissions have led to less prize money being on offer. Clubs that have maintained the value of their prizes have jeopardised their viability by carrying a higher proportion of their running costs than they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To add insult to injury, the Government failed to deregulate the Gaming Act 1968, as promised last year, to allow bingo clubs to advertise. In most towns and cities there are countless advertisements for the lottery, but bingo clubs are not allowed to advertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reports have been published on the impact of the lottery on the bingo industry. The Henley Centre report predicted a further 10 per cent. drop in clubs' turnover. I will not detain the Committee by reading a small selection of the many letters that have been received from bingo clubs, but the letters suggest that the 10 per cent. expected fall is a gross underestimate and state that the industry and the Government must urgently investigate the true impact of the lottery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must press the Government on why they felt unable to extend the cut in betting duty to the bingo industry. A staggering £927 million was staked on bingo in the last calendar year, and any reduction in duty for that year would be quite small. The loss in duty to the Treasury from bingo alone must be balanced against the possible long-term decline in revenue as more clubs face the prospect of closure. The total amount staked reflects not the performance of clubs and companies in the industry but the amount of money returned to players as prize money. Several factors have combined to increase the amount of stake while clubs' admissions, profitability and turnover have declined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bingo is not in such direct competition with the national lottery, as, perhaps, the pools are, but the lottery's impact on the bingo industry is clear. Before the lottery began, admissions and turnover were increasing. Since its launch, the trend has been reversed, with admissions in some areas down as much as 20 per cent. The industry knows only too well that, in the past six months alone, 35 clubs have closed, with the loss of 1,500 jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must further consider the benefits provided by bingo clubs. I must honestly confess that I am not particularly attracted to bingo and would not play it, but I know that many of my constituents enjoy it enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sad to hear that my hon. Friend does not enjoy bingo. One of my greatest pleasures as a Member of Parliament is visiting bingo clubs, and I am happy to say that the caller now calls No. 10 Blair's Lair. I have received representations from the people who run good bingo clubs in my constituency. Bingo clubs are an important part of the social fabric of the poorer parts of our country, and I hope that the Government will be prepared to investigate the national lottery's damaging impact on the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. I acknowledge the value of bingo as a social amenity; it offers many
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
people enjoyment and is an important focus of the community. Research shows that that is particularly true of elderly members of the community, and that is not a reflection on the age of my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)—I was talking generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is losing her supporters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advice that is often given is, "When in a hole, stop digging."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research shows that elderly members of the community feel a great loyalty to their local clubs, the social activity of which is very important. Bingo is the only gaming activity that has not been deregulated. Despite discussions that have been held over the past three years, no direct action has been taken to assist the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not able, at this stage, to pursue the argument, but we shall await the explanation of the Paymaster General before deciding whether to pursue the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first visited a bingo club last year, and I did so not once but twice. We have already heard hon. Members' view of bingo—some are callers, some are reluctant players. I confess that I am a proud winner. I am grateful to Gala Clubs, a division of Bass that is based in Nottingham, for introducing me to bingo. I visited an inner-city club in St. Anne's in Nottingham and subsequently visited a brand new leisure facility right on the edge of my constituency, Southglade Park, which is a big multimillion pound investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gala Clubs, other operators and the punters have told me that they are being disadvantaged by betting levies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South said, bingo is the only form of gaming that has not had any help from the Government—perhaps the Paymaster General will try to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is argued that bingo clubs need a cut similar to that made elsewhere—a reduction in duty from 10 per cent. to 8.75 per cent. The bingo industry is facing difficulties because it has not received such help. Admissions and spend are both down. Between November 1994 and May 1995, admissions were down by 10 per cent. and turnover by 6 per cent. A comparison with last year's figures shows that in the more disadvantaged areas, the decline has continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that there will be a downward spiral because the number of admissions governs the value of the prizes on offer: people through the door mean bigger bingo prizes. As the value of prizes becomes lower, the risk to clubs increases. Already, 35 clubs have closed, with the loss of about 1,500 jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bingo industry is big business. Thirty-five thousand people work in clubs across the country and they face other problems too. I understand that, for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
past three years, the industry has been discussing with Ministers the deregulation of the Gaming Act 1968 but that little progress has been made. A cut in bingo duty would boost prizes and would enable operators to return to normal participation levels and to profitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bingo operators want a level playing field. When I visited the inner-city club and outer-estate club, I was impressed by the number of women present, especially the number of elderly women. I had the opportunity to talk to them at length and to ask why they went to the club. It is clear that bingo is primarily about betting and gambling, but it is also a real social event. People feel part of their clubs—they feel part of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point, but I must say that the bingo industry has been given a bad deal—an unfair hand of cards—and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response because at a later stage it may be necessary to pursue this matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The background to the debate is the success of the national lottery. Huge new expenditure on the national lottery must shift some expenditure from other areas. It is impossible for the Government to try to compensate all traders and other forms of expenditure that may be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South made the common mistake of assuming that because of the success of the national lottery the central Government tax take must have increased. That does not follow. If expenditure has been shifted to the lottery from other high tax areas, there could be a decline in overall central Government revenues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the lottery, the Government have identified certain other areas of betting and gaming most directly in competition with the lottery and have cut duties accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not dwell on clause 8, but it proposes to cut general betting duty by 1 per cent. It is a matter of pleasure to the Government that the betting industry has agreed to pass that on to punters by reducing duty from 10 per cent. to 9 per cent. and increasing contributions to the Horse Race Betting Levy Board and British Greyhound Racing Fund. It is easy to see that those forms of betting are in direct competition with the national lottery, and it is clear that the pools companies have been directly affected. The very marked reduction in pools companies incomes was one of the reasons that caused us to cut the duty further by 5 per cent. The same is not necessarily true of other areas of expenditure, and that includes bingo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it follow, therefore, that if the bingo industry can show that is has suffered as significantly as if not more than, the pools industry, the Government will reconsider their position on bingo duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bingo is in a separate category because it is not long-odds, large-return betting. Indeed, the hon. Member for Bristol, South and others have alluded to the social aspect of bingo. Those who visit bingo clubs do so partly to gamble and to win, but they also do so to enjoy the social and leisure aspects of bingo. That is clear to hon. Members who have visited clubs in their constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some bingo clubs have been hit and have shut, but that does not apply generally. The hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) spoke of the danger of a downward spiral. Turnover has dropped by 6 per cent., as reported by the industry, but receipts from bingo duty have gone up. I acknowledge that that is probably caused by bingo promoters topping up prize money from their own resources, but that is not evidence of an industry in terminal decline. The fact that 35 bingo halls have closed, with the loss of some jobs, partly reflects the fact that the bingo industry is changing. The closure of old cinema sites in the centre of towns is being balanced by the opening of new bingo clubs, often with other facilities such as bars, restaurants and light entertainment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An independent report by NatWest Securities, prepared last November, claims:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Throughout the industry 40 units are expected to open in 1996"</p></blockquote>
which on the face of it would more than offset the closures. I accept that the bingo industry has been affected by the lottery, but I think that I have shown the Committee that it is not in the same category of betting and gaming as the national lottery or other forms of betting. With those thoughts, I hope that the Committee will acknowledge the help that we are giving the pools companies and others by the general reduction in betting duty but will not call on us to make a corresponding cut for bingo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with vehicle excise duty. I want to raise with the Paymaster General the particular problems that road haulage—freight transport—is experiencing, and will continue to experience, particularly with regard to the introduction of a scheme in several European Union countries last year that puts our road haulage companies at a disadvantage in competing in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vehicle excise duty, which has been frozen for a number of years, remains high compared with other European Union countries, and while that can be justified on environmental grounds it is the operating cost of work in the European Union that I wish to raise with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Holland and Luxembourg introduced a permit that is issued annually to goods vehicles at a cost of approximately £1,000 a year and is valid for five countries. It is a sort of additional environmental tax imposed by the five countries on the road haulage industry and it affects their industries as well as Britain's. Companies based in those five countries are liable for the charge, but each country operates a scheme that, in effect, gives rebates to its haulage companies. British companies, however, have to pay £1,000 per annum per vehicle, which clearly penalises them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Paymaster General aware of this problem? I understand that the industry has made representations to the Treasury. Has its concerns been raised with the countries concerned? Is the Minister able to offer British-based companies the same assistance as companies based in the five countries receive from their Governments? If not, why not? If that assistance cannot be given or it is not feasible to give it, will he explain what steps the Government are taking to attempt to remove what amounts to a discriminatory practice that is impacting on fair competition with member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say a few words in support of my hon. Friend and raise a further issue with the Minister? I am aware that road hauliers have already raised the issue with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is dressed up as some kind of a green measure by the countries concerned, but it clearly is not a green measure. A rebate is being given to their hauliers, yet British hauliers who use roads in Germany must make an additional payment of £1,000, leaving British haulage companies at a considerable competitive disadvantage. It is a blatant example of protectionism dressed up as a green measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been repeatedly asked to make representations to ensure a level playing field, but so far their response has been that they have no intention of doing so. This is causing some concern within the industry, especially among haulage companies. What does the Minister intend to do to secure a playing field for British hauliers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further issue about which I have received representations from a couple of constituents is excise duty charges for those who cannot pay the entire annual charge in one go. They pay in six monthly installments but pay an additional amount for the privilege of doing so. The reasons given for this is that it merely covers the costs of administration. I can understand the need to recover the costs of administration, but administration costs are falling due to the use of new technology. Organisations are finding ways and means and excuses for making charges for administration way above those that can be justified. Banks are the worst example because they charge people £20 or more for sending letters, but the Government are imposing a charge on poorer motorists
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
who find it difficult to pay excise duty in full. Surely that cannot be justified and only the administration charge should be clawed back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger that I may almost have to declare a constituency interest in virtually every clause of the first part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I express some sympathy with some of the views expressed about the competition that our haulage trade faces in Europe. I have the ferry industry of Dover in my constituency and it is dependent on the haulage trade for its success. I also have some successful haulage companies in my constituency, many of which have grown up almost from one-man and-a-lorry operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Haulage companies often write to me about the unlevel playing field with Europe. Ministers advance quite justifiable arguments about why the playing field is not as unlevel as it first appears in the context of the overall cost structures that lorries around Europe must face, but there is increasing concern that some of our European so-called friends are proving to be unfair competitors. Evidence from local haulage companies shows that we fairly try to recover the costs of roads and of pollution from our haulage lorries, whereas other European Union countries are not doing the same: they are, in effect, subsidising their transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard today how Spain will be able to use taxpayers' money to subsidise its airline. But it is not solely Spanish taxpayers' money—a point that the "Today" programme got wrong this morning, which it does not do often. Spain receives some British taxpayers' money, so, in effect, we will be subsidising its airline and its taxpayers in supporting their airline. It is important that we have information on what is going on. I hope that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General will either be able to assure the Committee that he has the information on the comparative positions of haulage industries in EU countries and how the clause affects them or will undertake to write to us. I for one do not want to see my ferry industry, and the haulage industry that uses it, suffering from unfair competition limiting the ability of British lorries to carry on a successful trade taking British goods to Europe and, in some instances, importing European goods to Britain. There certainly has been some evidence that there is not a level playing field in the haulage industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two points about vehicle excise duty on cars and the general thrust of policy in that area. The first is whether it would be more appropriate to have a differential rate of vehicle excise duty and the second is whether it would be more appropriate to put more tax on the use of cars rather than on ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that there should be a higher rate of vehicle excise duty for older vehicles without catalytic converters, which tend to produce more emissions, and a lower rate of duty for low-pollution
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
vehicles such as cars that can run on road fuel gas. That is a general area that should be investigated in future Budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other area is whether, within a position of fiscal neutrality, more tax should be levied on the use of cars rather than solely on their ownership. That is a sound general position to adopt. We all support people owning a car—I do not own one, but I do not object to others doing so—but we want to discourage the use of cars, so perhaps we should accelerate increases in tax on the use of cars and freeze or slow the increase in vehicle excise duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A study conducted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies backs that up. Entitled "Taxation and Environmental Policy: Some Initial Evidence", it suggested in 1990 that changing from taxing ownership to taxing the use of cars would cut car use by 8 per cent. in one year. This, of course, would immediately affect the amount of fuel consumed, the damage done to the environment and crowding on the roads. In the longer term, fuel-efficient cars would become more popular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are problems in rural areas, but compensatory mechanisms can be used, or certainly explored, to deal with the problem. It would be right in principle to tax more heavily the use of cars rather than their ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by adding my support to the points made earlier about the need to ensure a level playing field across Europe for the road haulage industry. It is certainly a live issue in my constituency, which has more than 10 road haulage companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leith about the prospect of having a differential rate of vehicle excise duty for older vehicles and of moving the burden of taxation more to usage, and it is that latter point that I should like to explore further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In today's modern age I remain to be convinced of the importance of sticking tax discs on cars. I recognise that vehicles excise duty is an important tax to the Exchequer. The last figures that I saw revealed that it raises some £3,600 million in a full year—a significant amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vehicle excise duty is a visible tax. Recent studies by the National Audit Office showed that more than 95 per cent. of motorists paid the tax. It has the benefit of being generally well observed and highly collectable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question whether we are concerned with the appropriate car documents. When I look at a car, I want to see, first, that it is roadworthy and has a valid MOT certificate and, secondly, that it is insured so that if it bumps into me I have redress to compensation. A distant third is knowing that the vehicle's owner has paid £140 to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I understand that the present system is a guarantor of both former points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
The system is open to evasion. When some people renew their tax disc they take insurance cover notes with them but do not pay the insurance. Similarly, they take their MOT certificate with them, but that certificate may have only a month to run and they do not intend to put their vehicle through a further MOT. It is not sufficient to have a tax disc as an assurance that cars are effectively MOT tested and insured. More attention needs to be given to both those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the whole purpose of having vehicle tax discs on windscreens. The prospect of linking vehicle excise duty to road mileage and the cost of petrol must be reconsidered. The possibility of motor vehicle insurance certificates being displayed on cars was raised in the House a year ago yesterday. I know that the insurance industry has set its face against having windscreen insurance discs, but more needs to be done and I should like to probe the Minister about what plans he has to look at the general burden of vehicle excise duty.

Is the Treasury considering using the vehicle excise duty database with the database of insurance companies? The insurance industry has suggested that as a sensible step forward in stopping a £250 million subsidy from people who pay motor insurance to those who fail to do so. I should be grateful if the Minister would focus on both issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to concentrate briefly on one matter—the transfer of goods from road to rail. It is staggering that the Government offer no financial incentive to reduce the number of juggernauts on our roads. Only last night, I was leafing through an excellent Central Office of Information publication, "Britain 1996" and it reminded me how dramatically the freight tonnage carried by the railways had dropped since 1990. Recently, when I was serving on the Committee that was considering the channel tunnel Bill we heard from an importer who imported Perrier from the south of France to east London. He told us that, unfortunately, the channel tunnel rail link will cause the closure of the freight distribution terminal, requiring 48 additional lorry movements per week to supply London with Perrier water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our roads are increasingly congested with large lorries. The Road Haulage Association and Freight Transport Association tell us that 90 per cent. of all inland freight is moved by road, but there must be opportunities to transfer some of that on to the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has the railway grant, the purpose of which is to encourage companies to transfer goods from road to railways, dropped so dramatically in recent years? Is it because the Government are not promoting it and are not encouraging companies to transfer goods on to railways? I would very much like to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause increases the rate of vehicle excise duty on cars, taxis and light goods vehicles and any other vehicle that is linked in legislation to that rate.

I have been asked a number of questions, particularly about balances between vehicle excise duty and fuel taxation. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith, supported by the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson), called for taxation to be put on usage rather than possession. That has been happening. The rate of taxation on fuel has increased much faster than on vehicle excise duty, which is lower in real terms than 10 years ago. Any further dramatic movement would disadvantage high-mileage users, and hon. Members who represent rural constituencies know that many people have to have a car and have to drive long distances. If we agreed such a change, disabled drives, who are exempt from vehicle excise duty, would experience increases in fuel but would not benefit from the VED reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be cautious but any move to abolish VED and tax fuel completely would be unwise, if only because we require a registry of vehicles to recall them for safety checks and for use by the police. The Republic of Ireland, which abolished vehicle excise duty for a few years, subsequently reintroduced it. Vehicles more than 25 years old will he exempt from VED, and I shall announce an extension to include all non-commercial vehicles, which goes beyond my right hon. and learned Friend's Budget announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pendle mentioned railways. Grants have been given to switch freight from road to rail, but Conservative Members believe that easily the best development to increase freight on our railways is privatisation. We have witnessed, for as long as I can remember, more money being spent on the railways but a steady decline in the proportion of freight carried. It need not be like that. It is a question of management and drive as much as of subsidy and grant. I believe that privatisation will deliver the benefits for which the hon. Gentleman called.

The hon. Member for Bristol, South asked about permits for motorways in other EU states. Permits have been introduced by a number of member countries. We have decided not to participate in the scheme. There is no question of our forbidding or rendering illegal those developments elsewhere in Europe, provided they are not discriminatory. I assure the Committee that we always have in mind the competitiveness of the United Kingdom haulage industry. Partly in recognition of that fact, we have frozen, not just in this Budget but in the previous Budgets, vehicle excise duty for heavy goods vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask members of the Committee to take into account not only the direct fuel and taxation costs of our haulage industry but the entire tax regime in which it operates. We have lower rates of corporation tax than almost all other advanced countries. Our national insurance contributions are lower and are set to fall further under this Budget, and we are unencumbered by a commitment to the social chapter. Taking into account the entire expenditure and taxation regime, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Dover will agree that we are not at a disadvantage compared with continental hauliers.

The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) asked about installment paying and administrative costs. Those who avail themselves of a six-month licence pay extra to cover administrative costs, but I am advised that VED stamps of £5 each are available from licensing post offices, which allow users to pay over a full year without incurring the surcharge to which he objected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that people are obliged to pay up front to purchase those stamps. They are expected to pay their vehicle excise duty before they otherwise would have to. Generally speaking, people who avail themselves of the six-monthly installment are those on relatively low incomes who simply cannot make that one-off annual payment. The availability of stamps might help people to budget, but it does not get over the other problem. Profits are being made by excessive charges for administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I told the hon. Gentleman that instead of paying in one sum at the start of the year such people can either take out the six-month licence, which incurs the extra cost, or purchase stamps, which avoids incurring the surcharge. That meets the point about the extra cost made by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>With those remarks, I commend the clause to the Committee.</p>

On behalf of the whole Committee, I should like to thank 	<i>Hansard's</i> shorthand writers for so quickly rallying to meet the problem caused by the breakdown of the equipment. I am advised that it may not be possible to guarantee that the technical fault will be overcome in time for this afternoon's sitting. Accordingly, it is likely that the afternoon sitting will be held in Committee Room 9, which, sadly, is rather less commodious than this one. Hon. Members may, if they wish, leave their papers in the Room until 4.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point or order, Mr. Hill. May I echo the points that you made and congratulate the shorthand writers on reporting some quite technical points this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause reduces vehicle excise duty on electric motor cycles to £15—the same rate as for petrol motor cycles of under 120cc. Electrically assisted pedal cycles are exempt from duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the 1994 Budget, electrically propelled vehicles were not subject to vehicle excise duty. During debates on last year's Finance Bill, we conducted a campaign to try to exclude milk floats from the new rate but were, unfortunately, unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Electric motor cycles were included in the same category. For reasons that we have been unable to fathom out, the Government have now decided to reduce the levy to £15—presumably to bring it in line with that for petrol motor cycles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Duty on electrically propelled motor cycles in this category was £35, but on their petrol equivalents it was £15, which rather shot to pieces the Government's environmental argument on the use of electronic
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
vehicles. Perhaps it was an error at the time, but a corrections now sought. Why are environmentally sound vehicles being taxed at the same rate as vehicles that use petrol, which are considered to be less environmentally friendly. Our amendment aims to remedy that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Electric vehicles are environmentally friendly because they reduce overall emissions of CO2 by up to 40 per cent. per kilometre. The United Kingdom's role in electronic vehicle development is small relative to other countries such as the United States, Japan, France and Germany, which have more constructive policies. Vehicle manufacturers are apparently not optimistic, and it is hardly surprising that the Government do not understand clearly the potential for development in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
