	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
	<p>(Except clauses 36, 105, 112 and 139 and schedule 15)</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. William Waldegrave)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Finance Bill (except Clauses 36, 105, 112 and 139 and Schedule 15) the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
This is the second year in which, after sensible discussions between Government and Opposition parties, we can look forward to more or less rational proceedings. The last time that I served on a Committee considering a Finance Bill was in the spring of 1981. I well remember the long, all-night sittings and the arrival of the late Sir Graham Page in his braces at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning with a great stack of highly technical amendments with which he would drive the unfortunate Ministers before him. It was a peculiar way of doing business. Interested parties from outside the House had to turn their lights upside down to keep up with the antique procedures. Our current procedures are obviously an improvement, and I hope that they will become established in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also nice to have you, Mr. Hogg, as Chairman. [	<b>Hon. Members:</b> "Hear, hear."] You have two crucial qualifications for overseeing the Committee. The first is that you can keep us on the straight and narrow financially because of your past membership of the Public Accounts Committee. There can be no backsliding on financial rectitude. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, you were once a deputy Chief Whip. Since you come from that formidable club, there will be no chance of ill discipline on either side of the Committee. You are supported by Sir James Hill, whom I served under before in a Committee considering a housing Bill in the mid-80s, so I know that the Committee will be well guided. We are grateful for your leadership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Chief Secretary in welcoming you, Mr. Hogg, as our Chairman. I am pleased that the wisdom and fairness with which you supervised our proceedings last year has resulted in your being in charge of us again this year. I, too—along with all my colleagues—am delighted that you are joined by Sir James Hill, who also has a well-deserved reputation for fairness and wisdom. I am confident that you will maintain a firm grip on our proceedings, Mr. Hogg, and perhaps especially so on a Thursday evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Chief Secretary said, last year's innovation was a success, especially in terms of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
improvements that we achieved on the Bill. We hope to repeat that achievement this year. We now have the third Chief Secretary in as many years in this Committee and we shall be interested to see how the latest Minister and his largely untried team fare. We can promise them searching scrutiny of the Bill, opposition where principle demands it, and constructive improvement where failings in the Bill require it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to be joined by my colleagues on the Back Benches and on the Front Bench, to which we welcome my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) who will keep Ministers on their toes, and my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) as Whip, who will keep us all organised. The Bill's length is matched only by its dullness and complexity. We shall do all that we can to liven things up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong proceedings but I am always glad to welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair. I know how fair-minded and balanced you are and that you will ensure that all points of view are fully and properly heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal-Democrats offer the same team as last year—it is unchanged, but undimmed in quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has the disadvantage of being the second longest Finance Bill, and I agree with the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) that it is rather dull. We shall not, therefore, delay proceedings unless we genuinely disagree or need clarification—which I hope Ministers will provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Finance Bill (except Clauses 36, 105, 112 and 139 and Schedule 15) the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waldegrave</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the order in which proceedings in Standing Committee on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 1 to 19, Schedule 1, Clauses 20 to 22, Schedule 2, Clauses 23 to 27, Schedule 3, Clauses 28 to 35, Clauses 37 to 52, Schedule 4, Clauses 53 to 65, Schedule 5, Clauses 66 to 70, Clauses 98 to 104, Clauses 106 to 111, Clauses 113 to 119, Schedule 16, Clauses 120 to 123, Schedule 17, Clause 124, Schedule 18, Clause 125, Schedule 19, Clause 126, Schedule 20, Clause 127, Schedule 21, Clause 128, Schedule 22, Clause 129, Schedule 23, Clause 130, Schedule 24, Clauses 131 to 138 Clauses 140 to 143, Schedule 25, Clause 146, Schedule 27, Clause 147, Clauses 149 and 150, Schedule 28, Clauses 151 to 154, Schedule 29, Clauses 155 and 156, Schedule 30, Clause 157, Schedule 31, Clauses 158 to 168, Schedule 32, Clauses 169 to 184, Schedule 33, Clause 185, Schedule 34, Clause 186, Schedule 35, Clause 188, Clause 71, Schedule 6, Clauses 72 to 75, Schedule 7, Clause 76, Schedule 8, Clauses 77 to 90, Schedule 9, Clause 91, Schedule 10, Clauses 92 and 93, Schedule 11, Clause 94, Schedule 12, Clauses 95 and 96, Schedule 13, Clause 97, Schedule 14, Clause 144, Schedule 26, Clause 145, Clause 148, Clause 187, Schedule 36, Clauses 189 and 191, New Clauses, New Schedules, Clause 190, Schedule 37.</p></blockquote>
Leaving aside the clauses that were dealt with on the Floor of the House, the Government intend to work through the remaining clauses in the sensible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
numerical order in which they are published. Schedules will be considered immediately after the clauses to which they relate. That is an established procedure. There is, however, one exception. We propose to take the clauses on loan relationships out of numerical order. The measures in them will introduce a simpler and more coherent tax regime for borrowers and lenders by repealing several complex rules for different bonds and replacing them with a single set of rules for all debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to take clauses 71 to 97, and clauses 144, 145, 148 and 187 out of numerical order because we have carried out a wide consultation exercise on them and want to take full account of the comments that we have received. We shall consider those clauses and related schedules towards the end of our deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SPIRITS: RATE OF DUTY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 16, leave out "£19.78" ', and insert "£18.96" '.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that you, Mr. Hogg, will recognise that the amendment's thrust would be extremely welcome north of the border. It would, however, benefit the entire United Kingdom economy. Although it may seem at first sight that cutting the duty on spirits by approximately double the amount that was proposed in the Budget would lead to a loss of revenue, the evidence suggests the contrary. Indeed, following the introduction of a 26p rise in spirits duty last year, the Chancellor so depressed sales of home-produced spirits—especially whisky—that the revenue yield fell. The reports from Customs and Excise indicate that that will be the likely outcome over a full year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced the 26p rise—which took place, you will remember, Mr. Hogg, after the House defeated the Chancellor's proposal to put 17.5 per cent. VAT on fuel—I described it as the polities of pique. There is evidence to suggest that it was introduced in a rush and quite contrary to what the Chancellor himself had said in his Budget speech only a few days earlier, when he specifically, identified the importance of the whisky industry and said that for that reason he had no plans to introduce any extra duty. And yet, a week later, after the humiliation of a defeat on the Floor of the House, he concluded that he had no option but to put 26p on a bottle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pointed out then that the consequence of that was counterproductive. I believe that the logical follow-through is to go further than simply reversing the cut. A cut of 27p as against the previous year's increase of 26p is not a dramatic difference. It enables the Chancellor to say that it is the biggest single cut in duty ever introduced on spirits—which is, of course, true and it is welcome. In reality, however, it is, over two years, only a cut of a penny and not of 27p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I will deal with the Scottish dimension, I do not believe that this is exclusively a matter of special pleading for the Scotch whisky industry and jobs in Scotland. That is one important effect, but probably not the most important in terms of the United Kingdom economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whisky export market is currently in a healthy state, but the home market has been more than a little depressed due to a combination of high duty, the impact of cross-border shopping and a tendency for people to switch to wine consumption, especially when there is such a wide differential between spirits and their alternatives, particularly wine, which enjoys a lower rate of tax. I accept that that is an on-going cultural switch which is taking place naturally and I am not trying to interfere with people's right to make such choices. I want to ensure merely that they are made on a fair and equal basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whisky industry in particular has been complaining for several years that it is at a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
disadvantage in the home market when compared with imported competitors. The added cost of producing whisky comes from the statutory requirement for it to be matured for a minimum of three years before it can be classified as Scotch whisky. Of course, many good whiskies are matured for much longer than that. The abolition, several years ago, of stock relief also added to the cost of whisky production and consequently squeezed the margins. That has been further aggravated by a further widening of the gap in duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is proof of our recognition of the whisky industry as a home industry that faces an unfair disadvantage against its major competitors. You, Mr. Hogg, may know this, but it is not widely known that one third of all branded spirits that are traded in the world is made in the United Kingdom. Scotch whisky is the most important of those, but we must recognise that we also produce a large amount of gin and other spirits, which makes a significant contribution to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Export sales of the major British commodities over 10 or 20 years show that Scotch whisky is consistently our biggest single export. It may be that in any given year, other products outsell whisky abroad but year on year, it is always in the top three and, taken over an extended period, whereas the sales of other commodities fluctuate, whisky continues to be a prime export, averaging between £2.5 billion and £3 billion of export sales. It is well known that a healthy home market is necessary if a good export market is to be sustained—even if the home market accounts for only 10 to 12 per cent. of total sales. Executives in the whisky industry have told me, as I am sure they have told Members on all sides of the House, that it has been extremely difficult to negotiate for a fair deal with those export markets where Scotch whisky is unduly discriminated against in terms of duty and import tariffs, when the standard retort from many Governments is "Why should we give you a better deal than your own home Government? If you cannot persuade them of the importance of your industry, why should we treat you differently?"

We must listen to that powerful argument and realise that the amendment would ultimately benefit the entire British economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It came out broadly against substantial reductions of duty. Did the hon. Gentlemen, as a member of that Committee, oppose those reports? Did his predecessor, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, oppose them? Did the hon. Gentleman table amendments calling for reductions in duties of the kind that he now proposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that I made it clear to members of the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee as it was then called, that I was in favour of reducing duty. Its report made it clear that the case on whisky and spirits was unproven—there was evidence to suggest, as Customs and Excise staff told the Committee, that the increase last year had led to a fall in revenue. The Committee reserved its position on spirits but acknowledged that there was evidence that the differential on spirits was having an effect. I was happy to endorse that report. The evidence we heard was useful and I was anxious to ensure that the Committee produced a report that we could all support; that does not prejudice my or my party's right to argue the case for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick upon Tweed (Mr. Beith), did not propose specific cuts in duty—I do not know whether that is because he does not drink. I have been Treasury spokesman for my party for almost two years and we have discussed the issue over that period; the industry has also marshalled its arguments effectively and I am not promoting a personal view It is a party view that has been endorsed by the party's policy committee. The argument that such a policy would be beneficial to the British economy is increasingly understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the effects on Scotland. The majority of the industry's jobs are based in the more populous areas of the central belt, where bottling and blending occurs. If the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) were here, he would support me vigorously, given that he comes from the home of Johnnie Walker and constantly reminds us of its contribution to the British economy, the jobs it creates and the difficulties the industry faces because of that discriminatory tax. In my own area of north-east Scotland mainly small distilleries are based in rural areas. In the past two or three years, 200 people directly employed in the whisky industry have lost their jobs because of the difficulties that the industry has had—those difficulties are not entirely due to tax, although that has contributed to the problems. That may not sound like a great many jobs, but they are relatively highly paid, skilled jobs in rural areas—sometimes very remote rural areas—where alternative employment is non-existent. That is a serious loss to a rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have suffered the closure of a distillery in my constituency. Its future is uncertain, but it is not operating at the moment. The sad fact is that the distillery was sold by its previous owners, Morrison brothers, to Suntory of Japan. At the time of the sale I was led to believe that that would be beneficial: it was well-known that Suntory is a relatively acceptable Japanese whisky because it is blended with a substantial amount of bulk Scotch malt to give it smoothness. It seems logical to me that Suntory would want a quality distillery, such as Glengarioch in my constituency, to produce that smoothness. Sadly, for one reason or other, it decided that it did not, so the distillery faces closure. Other distilleries have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
mothballed, and in other areas staffing and production levels have been reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a cyclical factor in the whisky industry, but I assert—my assertion is reinforced by the industry itself—that this discriminatory tax contributes to the decline in employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concluding remarks relate to the United Kingdom economy. Having established that over the years spirits, particularly whisky, have consistently been a major United Kingdom export, it is extraordinary that we continue to impose such high discriminatory taxes on the home market. I do not believe that the French would allow such savage discrimination against their home produced wine industry in relation to imported spirits—the reverse is true. It is illogical to penalise the home product in relation to its major competitor. We do not make significant quantities of wine in this country. I have nothing against English wine: I drink it from time to time and some of it is extremely good, and I wish English wine makers well. We will not create a major wine-producing market in this country, but we have a major spirits-producing industry that is under severe pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, I want the Government to equalise the tax on alcohol or alcoholic drinks on the basis of the alcohol content. The industry feels strongly about this issue. In the past, it was believed that the high tax on spirits was justified because they were considered to be "strong" drinks, as opposed to wine and beer which were not regarded as such. In fact, it is not the absolute strength of the liquid in the bottle that matters, it is the alcoholic content of what is consumed. For example, most people consume gin in a diluted form, adding tonic or other mixers, so that a gin and tonic is no more alcoholic than a glass of wine: indeed, probably less so than a glass of fortified wine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A measure of whisky usually has an alcohol content of 40 per cent., but most people drink it with water: indeed, that is the proper way to drink it. In the export market it is drunk with the most extraordinary range of mixers. When I visited one of J'B's distilleries, I discovered the mysteries and wonders of the blend and the secrets that were locked up inside that wonderful spirit. But I was astonished to find out that its biggest single export market is Spain, where it is drunk with a bottle of coke, so there is no possibility of unlocking those delightful flavours and aromas. The important thing, however, is that the Spanish drink it in very large quantities, which brings foreign exchange back home to the United Kingdom economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is logical to tax alcohol on the basis of the alcohol content. The spirits industry is asking for that, because it would put it on an equal footing with the wine industry. The amendment would not achieve that, but it moves in that direction and would have a beneficial effect. The whole economy would benefit from strengthening the home base for Scotch whisky. That would reinvigorate the export drive and protect jobs that have been lost at home, and the Treasury would lose far less directly through spirit duty than it thinks.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last time I sat on a Finance Bill two years ago, we started with something incomprehensible, which was made even more incomprehensible by the Minister—not one of the Ministers in Committee today, I hasten to add. I am pleased that we have started this morning with something down-to-earth, sensible and certainly relevant to my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), I am aware of the jobs argument. Only a year ago in Leith, there were three workplaces which dealt with either bottling or administration, but now there is only one. To be fair, one workplace has just been transferred, but the loss of the other has resulted in the loss of 80 jobs. We are mindful of the jobs argument in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, there is not a simple equation of jobs against tax. In 1979, for example, 26,000 people were directly employed in the whisky industry in Scotland; now the figure is 14,000. The tax discrimination against whisky existed in 1979 just as it does today. So, many other factors are involved. In the latest case in my constituency, the problem has more to do with the merging of companies, Whyte and Mackay having taken over one of the plants, which led to rationalisation and job losses. We are quite used to that following takeovers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the figures should be given: the 14,000 direct jobs in Scotland provide 47,460 other jobs in support industries and suppliers, according to the Fraser of Allendar Institute. Therefore, the whisky industry is a big employer in Scotland. To contrast it with the electronics industry, 11,000 direct jobs support only 15,000 other jobs because most electronics parts are imported. The whisky industry is a big employer in Scotland and that will influence Scottish Members and, I hope, other hon. Members too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must balance the health argument against the jobs argument when dealing with alcohol—that balance will become even more acute when we deal with tobacco. I know that well because, during the Budget debate, I welcomed the Chancellor's reduction in alcohol tax and said that I hoped that the trend could continue in future years. I was approached fairly quickly by the Edinburgh Council for Alcohol, which berated me for supporting any reduction in alcohol tax. There is a strong argument, as some hon. Members might have heard on "Panorama" two or three weeks ago, that any reduction in alcohol tax will lead to an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
increase in alcohol consumption, which is bound to lead to more alcohol abuse. Many medical experts follow that argument. We must take that issue seriously and consider it along with the other arguments. There is perhaps a way forward if we think in the long term about taxing drinks in accordance with their alcoholic content. There seems to be a certain logic to that. Prior to the Budget, the tax on spirits was only £20.60 per litre of pure alcohol whereas the tax on wine was £11.70 and on beer £10.82. There is an enormous discrepancy in terms of tax on alcoholic content. I think that most people would agree that that is for historical reasons. Some people point to the 1736 Gin Act. Spirit consumption was apparently a great deal higher then even than it is today and there was a problem that had to be dealt with. Other people point to the first world war when there was thought to be a problem with munitions workers drinking gin. Lloyd George raised the taxes on spirits and Austen Chamberlain famously said that people—I presume that he meant working people—did not drink wine so there was no need for action on that. So there are historical reasons why duties on spirits went way above those on wine and other alcoholic drinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know of any evidence to support the proposition that total equalisation would make it easier to abuse spirits than other drinks. Some people advance that argument. Within the general objective of taxation, it should be considered by alcoholic content. Research would be needed to establish whether spirits would become more open to abuse as a result of equalisation. Hon. Members may like to consider being confronted with a choice of drinking six pints of beer or 12 whiskies with the same alcoholic content. Which would they prefer? Perhaps neither, but that relates the issue to personal experience. Some people believe that spirits would be drunk in larger quantities. I do not know the answer; it is outwith my personal experience—for most of the time, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about discrimination against spirits is pertinent to jobs, exports and the balance of payments. They amount to further elements of the equation of which the Government must be mindful. The Chancellor referred to the problem in his Budget statement when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"High rates of duty at home have made it difficult for the Scotch whisky industry to press its excellent case for lower duties in other countries."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 November 1995; Vol. 267, c. 1065.]</p></blockquote>
That was one of the factors behind the Chancellof's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At £2 billion, whisky is certainly Scotland's biggest net export. It is in the top five United Kingdom exports, 40 per cent. of it going to European Union countries. It is important to increase sales in external markets, so we should do something about discrimination in our home market. Evidence suggests that there is a trade-off between whisky and other
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
alcoholic drinks—for example, as whisky sales have decreased by 30 per cent. in the past 15 years, wine sales have increased by 60 per cent. That means having more wine imports so it does relate to balance of payments. It has been estimated that if wine were taxed at the same rate as spirits, income to the United Kingdom would fall by £200 million per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The single market arguments are not so acute in relation to whisky. While there may be revenue problems if many people travel to France to buy Scotch whisky, it does not matter too much to the industry whether their bottles are sold in this country or in France. There may be a Treasury argument, but it is not so acute from the industry's perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor was also influenced by the fact that after putting up taxes on spirits last year, revenue fell. Much of today's argument could centre on this fact: at what point should tax be set in order to maximise revenue? That argument obviously leaves out questions about health, employment and other matters. The evidence is clear from the first five months of last year—as taxes went up, revenues in spirits went down by £62 million, of which £37 million were for whisky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has emphasised that demand is far more elastic when it comes to spirits. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For beer and wine the IFS rejects the hypothesis that duties are presently at revenue maximising levels but is unable to reject the hypothesis in the case of spirits."</p></blockquote>
There was further evidence for that argument earlier in the decade. When a 25p duty was levied in 1992, the Exchequer lost £80 million. When it was frozen in 1993, there was a recovery of £45 million. Much evidence therefore suggests that reducing duty increases revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sympathetic to the thrust of the amendment, but a further reduction this year is not the way to proceed. It would be more sensible to adopt a long-term strategy—indeed, the industry is talking of reductions of 4 per cent. a year, although I do not want to commit myself to that approach either. We should, however, think in those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must constantly monitor the effects of small tax reductions because we do not know what they will be. We have seen what happens when duty is increased or frozen, but it has not been reduced in our lifetime. There is a danger that the reduction is not passed on. This is the season of Burns suppers and I have to contribute bottles of whisky to those that I attend. When I went to buy a bottle last week, I was surprised to discover that the price had gone up by almost £2 following the Chancellor's action. I raised the matter with the Scotch Whisky Association, and it said that the increase was due to retailers, not the distillers. There can, therefore, be problems, and we shall have to examine whether the 4 per cent. reduction is passed on. If prices simply rise, tax reductions will not have the expected effect. We must, therefore, introduce small reductions and promise to continue them if they have the effect that the industry desires and predicts.

I have obviously been influenced by the Edinburgh Council for Alcohol, and we must always be mindful of the health arguments.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury has customarily set taxes on alcohol after considering only the United Kingdom context. We must, however, now consider the European context—that is true not only for spirits, but for wine and beer too. If we follow the route that is proposed in the amendment and simply seek national solutions, we shall fail to address the point made by the hon. Member for Gordon, who said that taxation in our home market must help to shape taxation across Europe. Whether we like it or not, our domestic system will be seen to represent what we think is appropriate throughout the European market. If we accept the amendment, we shall be saying that we should lower tax on spirits alone. All European states discriminate against spirits. The United Kingdom is, however, the major European producer of spirits, and the shape our taxation system is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) said, the result of this change in duty rates is not clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scotch Whisky Association, which has made the points to us that the hon. Gentleman has made today, says that it is not yet able properly to assess the impact of duty on price rises and job losses in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking to a conference in May last year, the Paymaster General said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Progress (towards duty harmonisation) is unlikely to be rapid…"</p></blockquote>
That might be an understatement, but we would all agree with it. Greater convergence of duty will make both legitimate and illicit border trade less attractive. We are all concerned to balance the revenue that comes into the Treasury from the alcohol industry, in order to assist the industry to develop and be successful while protecting our revenue base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alcohol industry makes a major contribution to our economy. It provides 1.1 million jobs and generates £2.8 billion in exports. It is not just a question of duty of spirits; it is a wider issue. It is a question not of cutting duty rates here and there but of looking for a planned approach, recognising our problem with alcohol duty rates and examining how we can realistically deal with it. There are many arguments to be settled. For instance, one of the main areas of disagreement is on substitution—how much cross-border shopping replaces purchases in Britain
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
and how much is additional. That argument rages more fiercely in regard to beer but also relates to spirits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public are being encouraged to avoid paying duty by the advertisements that appear regularly in our papers for free trips to France on ferries or hovercrafts, or reduced price trips on the channel tunnel. That may bolster the low out-of-season usage rates for ferries, hovercrafts and trains—some people my see them as Robin Hood expeditions on which they can bring back drink for their friends, even though they are not supposed to—but we are creating a climate in which people feel that that is acceptable. The decline in Customs and Excise and in customs enforcement means that we are not tackling the issue. The amendment does not deal with those major issues for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence from the trade is that the duty on one bottle of alcohol in six consumed in Britain has not been paid in Britain. That is a question of the integrity of our tax base. What is going wrong with our policies? Are they fitting together? Do we need to change our analysis and strategy to protect the industry, the consumer and, very important, Treasury revenue at a reasonable and sustainable level? If that statistic about one in six bottles is accurate, it represents a loss of revenue to the Exchequer of about £1 billion. An example of some of the legal and illegal ways in which that loss is occurring is a survey—the third it has conducted—by the Wine and Spirit Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is a small survey, but it is none the less worthy of consideration. It observed 1,000 cars on one day of the year—always a day at the end of August, but not near the bank holiday. There has been a staggering increase in the legal trade, let alone in illegal cross-border shopping. Wines and Spirits are now the largest part of that problem; 11 per cent. of all wines and spirits consumed in the U.K. are now purchased outside the country.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey showed that in 1994–95 there was a 175 per cent. increase in the amount of spirits that came across. That was just in legal trade. The number of cars travelling backwards and forwards legally also increased by 17 per cent. The loss of duty, not including VAT, was in the region of £33 per car. Given the number of cars that cross the channel—and I understand that it is large—the loss to the Revenue is enormous, and the average quantity of both wine and spirits—imported legally is increasing dramatically. Although we understand the Paymaster General's difficulties with regard to cross-border shopping, we do not think that he is tackling the problem with the urgency that he should.

I shall give some examples of the development of illegal activity. The criminal act of smuggling is taking place on a vast scale. Networks are building up, and I am not talking about the people who are paid £50 to drive a transit to Dover and Calais and back. I am talking about those people who organise the drivers of the transits and lorries. They have set up distribution networks which are becoming established parts of our communities. Such networks can be, and are, used for other commodities—for example, hand-rolling tobacco, which we will discuss with other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a growth of what we might call neighbourhood consortiums—groups of friends who visit France every few weeks and bring back wine and spirits for themselves. Increasingly, truck drivers who frequently cross the channel bring back cheap alcohol which is then sold on. That is an illegal activity, but the Government are not properly enforcing the law. There is a great deal of publicity about how to get a cheap ferry, but none of the necessary publicity about the success of Customs and Excise. Then there are professional bootleggers and the increase in fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave an example on the Floor of the House to the Paymaster General about beer. The exports of beer to France and the recorded imports of beer into France from here were approximately in line. In 1994, there was a difference between what was exported from Britain—allegedly into France—and what was imported into France of 1,107,000 barrels of beer. Those figures mainly concern high-strength beer. Unless the barrels were consumed on a booze cruise—it would have had to be rather a long one—that is a Tot of alcohol to be missing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Phantom exporters run containers loaded with high-strength beer or spirits which are purchased duty-suspended for export to the continent. Creative paperwork, using French and United Kingdom customs stamps and documentation—forged, of course—suggests that the load has been exported when it has, in fact, never left Britain. It is then resold in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
United Kingdom. We know that that is going on because customs has had some success in checking it, but not enough progress is being made.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorely tempted to go down the route suggested by my hon. Friend. I think that the point is well made. I was trying, in my most reasonable mode to engage the Government in a debate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much. The Chief Secretary may say that I do it very well, but that might be because he has not seen me do it very often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tried to engage the Government in a serious debate about the problems with duty rates not just on spirits but on all alcoholic drinks. That is the true problem, not only because it is a current problem, but because it will get worse, and we in the Labour party are likely to be the ones who inherit and have to solve it after the next general election. Therefore, we thought that we would raise the discussion again this year as we did last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wider questions have been raised about the health argument and they apply to the tobacco debate as well. Is it a sensible health policy to use taxation—price—to try to deter consumption? We can tell, given the growth of illegal activity, that deterrence is not happening. I am talking about the fraud that we believe is occurring on a massive scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who gain access to illegal products are of all ages. There are substantial problems with very young people gaining access to high-strength beer as well as to spirits on estates and in communities throughout Britain. The Chief Secretary will sympathise with my experiences of some of the estates in my constituency, where illegal activity is going on. People are sold cheap products which go to children and cause problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as we discuss the convergence of duty between products—the idea that we should examine whether there is a convergence between all alcoholic drinks, as was raised by the hon. Member for Gordon, who called it an alcoholic content tax, I think—we should also consider the wider arguments about how our duty fits into a European strategy and fulfils this country's obligations as a member of the European Union. We should also examine how it relates to health issues, how we encourage people to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
adopt sensible drinking habits and how we control under-age drinking in particular. Inadequate though it is, regulation of alcohol consumption in pubs by an age bar to its purchase has been reasonably effective, notwithstanding that some people lie about their age. That is not just a problem with younger people; it occurs at the other end of the age spectrum as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering all three clauses to do with the duty on alcohol, especially on spirits, we must ensure that the decisions we take are properly assessed with regard to the behavioural consequences of the change. The industry argues that if the duty is decreased, consumption will increase, so more taxes will be collected and the Treasury will not lose any income. That may or may not be true. It may not be desirable to encourage people to drink more. The substitution argument does not necessarily hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue goes much wider than Europe. The hon. Member for Gordon referred to Japan. I asked Allied Domecq, which is based in my consistency, for its views. It used the example of Japan and the complexities of setting duty rates. It said that Japan charges excise duty on domestically produced spirits at a very low rate compared with that imposed on imported spirits. Allied Domecq believes that, in theory, like products should be similarly taxed. In 1989, Japan was taken to GATT, the general agreement on tariffs and trade, which ruled that it should change its tax system. Since then it has changed the duty on domestically produced whisky—that may be why the Japanese firm to which the hon. Member for Gordon referred came into play—but has still not changed the duty on other spirits, saying that they are very different to imported alcohol, and therefore should not be taxed in the same way. As a consequence, Japan is being taken to the World Trade Organisation, which is currently deliberating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the World Trade Organisation is considering the problem, a European review is taking place, and we know that there are difficulties in the export market as well as with consumption in the United Kingdom. A simple amendment to lower the duty does not affect those issues. Will the Paymaster General explain Government policy on the convergence of duty levels on different alcohol products? Will he tell us how Customs and Excise will be able to pursue illegal and fraudulent activity in this area when faced with a cut of 4,000 officers in the next four years, as currently planned? Will he explain how well the Excise Alliance, which was set up to deal with fraud, is functioning and what successes it has had?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Paymaster General tell us whether, as a way forward, the Government are prepared urgently to set up an independent and comprehensive study to analyse the effects of smuggling and cross-channel shopping, as well as the wider European context of setting duties to meet the requirements of our membership of the European Union? Will he produce policy options for the future which include costs and benefits, direct and indirect, to consumers, employment, industry, retailing, distribution and, importantly, to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Treasury? That study should be overseen by a committee including representatives from the Government and from the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to establish a partnership of all the stakeholders in the industry. They should come together to recognise problems and develop a strategy—over a number of years, not just one year—to deal with those difficulties, that are threatening a great deal of income which will be desperately needed by Governments of any complexion in future</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is an interesting attempt to reduce the rate of duty on whisky by more than is proposed in the Bill. One reason behind it is to bring the duty down to a level that is in greater harmony with that of our European competitors. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) has already explained how decisions about excise duty must be taken in that wider European context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to consider what effect the amendment would have on smuggling. We have already touched on the subject in our debate. Some studies have suggested that for every six bottles of spirits drunk in this country, one is brought in from day trips abroad. The cross-channel ferries have become big business. More specifically, smuggling has become big business. I have heard persistent rumours in my area of the Nottinghamshire coalfields that many former miners have developed new skills, becoming drivers and entrepreneurs. One wonders whether that is what the Government mean by this country becoming the enterprise centre of the world. A great deal of enterprising behaviour is certainly taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply, the Minister should tell us his assessment of the loss of revenue from whisky through cross-channel trips. He should be mindful of figures recently given in parliamentary answers which suggest that smuggling is on the increase. In 1992–93, Customs and Excise made 1,473 seizures to a value of £238,494. In 1994–95, slightly fewer seizures were made. That worries me because all the rumour on the street is that smuggling is on the increase. Last year, however, just 1,398 seizures took place. The worrying point is that the worth of the amount of goods seized had risen tenfold to £2,171,000. Those figures make it clear that an awful lot of revenue is being lost. Of course, those are only the official figures in the book: behind them must lie enormous sums. It has been estimated that seizures represent 5 per cent. only of all the illegal goods entering the country from abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have more figures on whisky. I have some figures on beer supplied by the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, which suggest that 1 million pints a day cross the channel. That represents 4 per cent. of the British market or, more significantly, 16.5 per cent. of take-home trade. Those are enormous figures, and the statistics for whisky might be similar. Given the scale of duty, the Exchequer has lost out significantly. It lost £181 million in beer taxes—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
£121 million in excise duty and £60 million in VAT. What gets up the industry's nose is that, while we have lost out, the French Government have gained £33 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Action must be taken to stop smuggling and other enterprising behaviour. I am concerned about the cuts in Customs and Excise Officers. The Government need to make a real commitment to support their work, even if they have to refocus their priorities. Ultimately, however, careful analysis and good planning could bring money back into the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to launch a campaign to tackle the illicit sale of contraband. To bring the issue closer to home, that the Conservative club in the constituency of Northampton, North was recently prosecuted for selling illicit goods. I commend Customs and Excise for that action and hope that its officers will visit many more Conservative clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers need, most importantly, to stand up for British interests and consumers. As the hon. Member for Gordon and my hon. Friend the Member for Leith said, the whisky industry is a big employer, and jobs are at stake. The Minister should speak to the Chancellor, his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clark). A home brewery recently closed in the area, and beer imports across the channel were cited as one of the reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong argument for drawing all the interested parties together. People in the industry have pressed for a comprehensive study of the problem. We should act on such expressions of good will and on research that has already been done to build a comprehensive strategy—spearheaded by the Government and Customs and Excise—to tackle smuggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue is clearly losing out and intolerable behaviour is being engineered across the country. Smuggling is a problem, and I hope that the Government will take firm action to reduce it and balance their books.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief intervention because the cross-channel ferry trade has been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just before Christmas, I visited the customs operation at Dover port, which is most effective. Additional staff had been introduced in the run-up to Christmas, and several additional prosecutions were made as a result. I witnessed the operation in action, and several people were hauled in for questioning. The questions and answers were interesting. Several people claimed that they had made only one previous visit, some months earlier, but while I was there the computer whirred into action and a print-out was immediately produced of the number of visits that that couple had made over the past three months. It was a considerable number and they had a transit van with a large load. So there is undoubtedly a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Although the ferry industry in Dover has benefited enormously from the extra trade, there is a question mark about the real benefit it brings—it also does much damage to licensed businesses in Dover, east Kent and, as has been mentioned, wider afield. I hope, however, that we will not lessen the duty because the revenue to Britain from additional alcohol and tobacco duty is huge. It is fundamental to the financing of our health service. I do not often agree with the hon. Member for Bristol, South but she made a valid point: whatever the colour of the future Government, they will still need revenue from alcohol and tobacco duty to finance necessary services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what extent will the Government protect duty by examining additional law enforcement measures? As I talked to the customs officers in Dover and saw the actions that they were taking in front of me—hauling people in for questioning—I realised that the penalties are still quite generous for people who claim that they are using the alcohol or tobacco for personal use. We should examine whether those levels could be lowered further and what European action can be taken to protect our duty levels. Another aspect that came across from my visit was that there should be more cooperation in Britain between customs, the police and social security. Some of the people who carry out such actions are on social security and there should be more co-ordination between the various computer systems in order to identify possible social security fraud as well as duty evasion. If there were more co-ordinated joint actions, at the port and outside it, between police and social security officers, many of the people engaging in that trade could be put out of business. There should also be a greater effort to examine the hire companies that are hiring out vans—although sometimes people buy them. We know that hire companies are cooperating with customs and that is one reason why they should not be unnecessarily penalised by having their vans taken away. But customs could none the less perhaps take a tougher approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister might comment on how the duty levels will be protected, because while it is one thing to change the levels, it is another to protect the overall revenue that accrues to the country from duty, which is very important in financing the Government's business. I look forward to his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw). He confirmed my strong belief that it is better to use the channel tunnel, because if one takes a ferry one may be hauled off and cross-examined in his presence—an eventuality that would strike terror into any decent, honest citizen. I was also interested to hear about his suggestion for a wide range of new regulations on car hire companies, social services and so on, that would make life even more awkward for citizens. The fundamental problem—to which the hon. Member for Gordon was right to allude—is the difference between levels of taxation, particularly between France and this country. We need both to seek harmonisation that would on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
whole be downward for spirits, wines and beers that are easily bought in Calais supermarkets—many of which, such as the giant Tescos and Sainsburys, are run by the British companies—and upward harmonisation, where possible, on the part of our European partners. To achieve that, the Government must change their dog-in-the-manger approach to cooperation, opting in and qualified majority voting on such issues. I hope that the Minister will address that important matter when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statistics for overall alcohol consumption show that we are out of kilter with our European partners. Britain, I am sorry to say, has fallen to 19th in the league table of total alcohol consumption in major countries. Whereas the Czech Republic's consumption of beer increased substantially after the fall of communism, people in the United Kingdom—although one might think that we would turn to drink after 16 years of Conservative Government—are turning away from it. One of the reasons for that, to which several hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have alluded, is the great increase in drinks that have been smuggled, in one way or another, in from France.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1984 there were 128 operating breweries in the United Kingdom. That number has fallen to 93—a significant reduction in consumer choice, regional identification and, of course, employment. The Government are supposed to be tough on drinking and tough on the causes of drinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must decide whether to aim narrowly at minor reductions in duty on alcohol or whether to target excise duty specifically. Of course, reductions can sometimes mean increases after defeats on the Floor of the House—the defeat over VAT on fuel led to the sudden increase in duty at the end of 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a special plea for much stricter and stronger targeting of the evil and monstrous new drinks that are aimed at the under-age population or perhaps those who are just over 18. I am thinking in particular of Hooch, one of a number of mixer drinks which are sold almost as lemonade, Ribena or orangeade but with an extra kick. I see children and under 18s in car parks and common areas of my constituency clutching such bottles. It is difficult to exercise serious control on those young people now because they can buy the drinks in supermarkets and Thresher's, among others. The impression given is that such drinks are normal children's fizzy drinks which simply have an extra buzz.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no competition with the continent in those drinks. I occasionally drink wine and other drinks in France, but those obscene, child-oriented paedophilic drinks are not on sale on the continent. We must consider harmonising downwards on the classic drinks—hard spirits, in which Britain excels, beer and English wine. Recently, while in Switzerland I was delighted to be offered English wine at a reception given by the British embassy; I hope that the Treasury will offer only British wines and other British drinks at its endless drinks parties and receptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I hope that the Minister will address the need for future Budgets to make clear, year on year, that while we seek European harmonisation and want less excise duty on our drinks and more on French drinks on sale in France, we will specifically target the new generation of drinks, aimed, through powerful advertising, at converting children, adolescents and school leavers into people who buy drinks containing a high, hidden alcoholic content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Finance Bill traditionally begins with a discussion on alcohol and its taxation and you, Mr Hogg, have allowed a fairly general debate. I shall follow that pattern in order to introduce the clause as well as speaking to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gordon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee needs no reminder of the importance of the spirits industry. The hon. Member for Leith outlined his constituency interest in the matter and the importance of the whisky industry for employment and for exports. I underline those points. They are one reason why my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor reduced the spirit duty in his Budget statement by 4 per cent. In reaching his decision, he took into account a wide range of considerations—not just the effect on revenue but consumer and trade interests too. The 4 per cent. cut roughly translates into a cut of 27p on a typical bottle of spirits and was generally passed on by the industry, to answer a point raised by the hon. Member for Leith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry welcomed the cut in spirit duty and described it as the first for 100 years. I do not know whether that is exactly the case, but the cut was widely and genuinely welcomed although voices in the spirits and alcohol industries would have welcomed a further cut or look forward to further cuts in the future, which we cannot predict or discuss this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South said that she would not support the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats because an 8 per cent. spirits cut would deal only with an isolated part of a general problem of divergence of alcohol duties in Europe. I will not support the amendment either, but not for that reason. I think that it is up to us to respond to anomalies and distortions in the context of our budgetary procedures, even if that does not provide a comprehensive solution to the difficulties of cross-border shopping and smuggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cross-border shopping was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover among others. We take seriously that issue. My hon. Friend will know that smuggling has exercised Customs and Excise officials and has led to deployment of extra staff, especially in his constituency, during the current financial year. We aim to deploy additional staff again in the next financial year. A further 20 posts will be allocated during 1996–97.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited Dover to see for myself the work that is being undertaken to intercept the smuggling trade and to police legitimate cross-border trade. The Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
must remember that there are different issues here. Cross-border shopping is legal, provided that the alcohol is brought back for personal consumption. That people can do that is one of the important freedoms of a single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past year, we set up a joint customs and trade working group that has analysed the figures and gone through the methodology of various studies to try to quantify the extent of cross-border shopping. It has been established that it accounts for between 3 and 5 per cent. of the United Kingdom market. Some of this trade is incremental—people go to Calais or other places on the continent to buy goods in addition to what they would purchase on the home market because of the cheaper continental prices. So not all of that 3 to 5 per cent. represents a loss to United Kingdom retail and wholesale trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Smuggling is a separate issue. It is illegal. It is also very difficult to quantify because, by definition, what is illegal is also invisible. A number of estimates have been made, some of which are exaggerated. However, they pinpoint a real and genuine problem and we are anxious to do as much as we can to improve our estimates. We know that alcohol excise receipts are holding up quite well generally. The quantity of beer, for example, cleared for sale last year was higher than in the previous year. We are therefore not witnessing a wholesale collapse in the home market for most categories of alcoholic drinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General is saying that cross-border trade represents up to 5 per cent. of the British market. Does that include smuggling, or is it additional to the 5 per cent.? Is there no way to quantify illegal smuggling in comparison with legitimate cross-border trading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the figure I gave was for measured cross-border shopping. It applies generally to the alcoholic drink trade, though the figures for sectors within it are different. As I said, smuggling is extremely difficult to measure. We simply do not know its extent and we are anxious for further work to be done to establish that. We counter the smuggling trade, however, even though it cannot be quantified. We know duty receipts with arithmetical precision and they do not show a cataclysmic fall, which might be the case if home trade were being undermined in an uncontrolled and systematic way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise has set up the Excise Alliance with trade groups, which is important. We should remember that smuggling not only costs the Treasury and the general taxpayer money; it undermines legitimate trade. We are receiving excellent and increasing co-operation from the wholesale, retail and production arms of the drinks trade, and from those who transport and distribute alcoholic drinks. That is helping us to counter this menace.

	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover has suggested additional measures, particularly better cooperation within Departments—especially the Department of Social Security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about the Excise Alliance, will the Paymaster General tell us when it last met and whether it has a programme of work intended to address the important issues that he identified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Excise Alliance was set up at the end of last year: it held a meeting soon after the official launch. I do not have its agenda of future work, but I will endeavour to make inquiries if the hon. Lady is interested. It was launched with commitment by the trade bodies concerned and I have no doubt that the work programme for the year ahead wilt tackle many of the difficulties and weaknesses that have been referred to this morning.

Finally, I emphasise to the Committee and to the wider world that the penalties for smuggling are already draconian. People who are convicted face up to seven years imprisonment and unlimited fines. Even if they are not taken through the courts, people who are found smuggling or endeavouring to import amounts not for their personal consumption, risk seizure not only of the goods involved, but of their vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my visit to Dover, I met a man who said that he was unemployed and came from Yorkshire. He was driving a Mercedes car with a trailer on the back full of alcohol. When we opened the back door of the Mercedes thousands of cigarettes fell out. Those goods were seized on the spot and the vehicle and trailer were impounded. The man had to find his own way back to Yorkshire without them. I venture to say that he will not attempt to evade excise duty or to smuggle goods in future. Penalties are being applied and we are deploying extra staff where the risk justifies it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for having missed the first part of the debate. I, too, visited Dover some time ago—it seems to be the place to go. I was in the control tower where Customs and Excise is based and from where one can see the forecourt where the ferries dock. Even with my unskilled eye, I was struck by the number of Ford Transit vans coming off the ferry ramps that we so low that I could see the sparks underneath them. It is a common experience when one goes on holiday to notice cars that are heavily loaded with something or other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the impression that it was quite rare for those vehicles to be stopped. If people thought that there was a real chance that they would be stopped, perhaps some of the problems would go away. I tried to declare that about 4 in of gin in a bottle that I had brought into this country, but I had great difficulty finding a customs officer: I did not want to be accused of breaking the law and of being guilty of having double
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
standards. How often are such checks carried out? If they were carried out routinely when there was a reasonable belief that goods were being smuggled, we might resolve many of the problems that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman probably was not questioned by a customs officer about his 4 in of gin, because the officer doubtless concluded that it was for his personal consumption and so did not fall into the category of smuggling or avoidance of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I watched the operation from the ground where customs officers stop, open and inspect transit vans under suspicion. Because of the single market we no longer have a fiscal frontier, so vans cannot be routinely stopped. The significance of intelligence and investigation work is to identify the risk and to target the anti-smuggling resource where it is likely to bring the best return. The number of people convicted and the quantities of goods seized show that we take the problem seriously and are making life increasingly difficult for those who undermine legitimate trade and the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady will forgive me, I must explain why I cannot accept the amendment. The hon. Member for Gordon said that the 8 per cent. cut would pay for itself, although he advanced little evidence. Those who want specific tax cuts commonly say that they will pay for themselves, but that often ignores the consequential secondary effects of tax cuts. If we lower duty dramatically in one sector, it can, for example, induce expenditure to switch away from other drinks and expenditure categories. Taxation can, therefore, be lost elsewhere, and that must be included in the equation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To back up his claim, the hon. Gentlemam said that whisky sales have declined in recent years whenever duty has been increased. He conceded, however, that cultural influences are important. Social and drinking habits change, and other alcoholic drinks become more popular and more competitive. That can lead to a rise or decline in the popularity and sale of drinks that is separate from the level of taxation. That is why we have built in an affordable revenue loss by reducing excise duty by 4 per cent. in the Budget. The hon. Gentleman has not done so, however, and assumes that his proposal will pay for itself or that it is affordable. The Liberal Democrats still have the regrettable habit of cutting here, adding there and of putting taxes up in one sector and down in another with no regard to overall financial responsibility.

The Liberal Democrats want to put 1p on income tax to fund increased education expenditure. Judging by the actions of Liberal Democrat-controlled Somerset county council, however, we must increasingly doubt that commitment to education. Following its standard spending assessment, the council received more than £7 million extra for
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
education from the Government, but it will pass on only £4 million to the children of Somerset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now witness another retreat from that commitment to education. Part of the extra revenue that would come from a 1 per cent. increase in income tax will now be spent not on education, but on reducing spirits duty. That is irresponsible. My right hon. and learned Friend has, by contrast, made a responsible and affordable cut in the rate, and the Committee should, therefore, reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate. I am a little confused about the Labour party's position—it thinks that we need to take radical steps and that it is, therefore, impossible to support a modest amendment that might take us in the right direction. Much concern was expressed about the problems of the single market, cross-border shopping and customs control. Apart from a commitment to introduce extra customs officers, however, there was little sign of an alternative policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is specifically targeted, although smuggling and cross-border shopping are tangential to it, and it is reasonable and logical to raise those problems. The debate has, however, demonstrated that they will be ongoing as long as wide differentials exist. We may be more or less effective in dealing with smuggling, but we shall not completely eliminate it as long as differentials are so wide that substantial incentives remain. Smuggling alcoholic drinks from the continent is big business because of differentials.

The hon. Member for Dover said that he had examined and was impressed by enforcement methods. I understand that the extra staff who were introduced for Christmas were taken off afterwards and that it was therefore only a short burst of enforcement. Even the hon. Gentleman must recognise that, much as he wishes to ensure that trade is controlled, not least for the benefit of licensees in his constituency, he would not welcome every vehicle being stopped and searched. Indeed, if that happened, no one would wish to travel on the ferries because of the delays that would ensue. So there is a practical problem with ensuring an adequate enforcement that is compatible with a service that people wish to use. Neither side of the Committee has the complete answer—there is not and cannot be such an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman read the report "The Spirit of Competitiveness", which was commissioned by the whisky industry, because much of the information he gave was included in it. I recommend that he reads the submission on the relationship between revenue and duty rates. In paragraph 3.9, the report states that in the year to March 1993, excise duty revenue fell as a result of a 4.4 per cent. increase in duty. In March 1994, when there was a freeze, the amount of revenue coming into the Treasury increased, as did consumption. The amendment does not propose a freeze: it proposes a cut in addition to the one that the Government propose to replace the increase they introduced last year. It does
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
not propose an assessment of how much that will cost or any acknowledgement that there is a general duty problem. If the hon. Gentleman had wanted to deal with the issue as a general duty problem, he could have tabled an amendment on it—but he declined to do so. I have laid out clearly what Labour would do to address that general problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady intervened before I had dealt, as I plan to, with the thrust of her comments. I think I know what my amendment was intended to do. The fact that I did not table amendments to lower duties across the board does not alter the fundamental point that there is a clear discrimination between spirits, wine and beer. That is the specific point I am addressing. The hon. Lady's point is fair, but irrelevant. Labour's attitude is somewhat unclear. The figures that she alluded to from the industry's report indicate that increase in duty led to a fall in revenue and that a freeze of duty led to a rise in revenue. I contend—although I accept that it is not provable, any more than the Treasury forecasts are provable since they have been proved wrong—that a further cut in duty might well lead to a rise in revenue. I accept the Paymaster General's argument that there might be substitution effects, but part of my contention is that a cut will contribute to a stronger home base for the Scotch whisky industry and other spirits industries in Britain. At the very worst, that will mean fewer job losses and may mean some recovery in employment. It will help to strengthen the base of the whisky industry in the export market which should generate further profits. So while various other factors could increase revenue across the board, the fact remains that in the Red Book the Government forecast the beneficial effect of an increase in spirits duty last year which not only did not materialise but turned out to be completely incorrect since there was a negative effect. No one knows the dynamic effect of those changes for certain. I believe that it is desirable to end the discrimination and to take a step in that direction. It is reasonable to assume that that will bring benefits although it is difficult to quantify them exactly. I believe—and there there is evidence to support it—that that is likely to be almost wholly beneficial to the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also made some rather snide, and incorrect, remarks about the position of the Liberal Democrats on the issue. The terms and the cost based on the Treasury's assessment—which I am entitled to suggest will not prove correct—contained in the amendment were all included in the Liberal Democrat alternative budget which we published in November. We have worked on the basis that the Government would have used if they had made a similar calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore a responsible and perfectly costed proposal, which has nothing to do with our policy on education or our attitude towards income tax, where the figures are, in any case, much more substantial.
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The Minister made an unworthy remark, which he knows is irrelevant to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not be drawn on the vagaries of local government finance, other than to say that we all know exactly what the Government are at—squeezing local authorities and trying to transfer the blame for financing their own tax cuts on to those authorities. The Government are trying to disguise their own appalling mismanagement in failing to control borrowing to justify tax cuts that are politically necessary but for which there is inadequate cash in the system. Local authorities are capable of defending themselves against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith quite properly raised the issue of health. I appreciate that he supported the thrust of many of my arguments. Of course health is important; and alcohol abuse is important. The unfairness lies in the fact that the spirits industry has to carry the burden of the health argument while other sectors of the drink industry are let off much more lightly, especially wine, which is mainly imported. The argument that spirits are somehow more conducive to alcohol abuse than wine or beer is not borne out by the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand health campaigners who say that there is too much alcohol abuse; that the duty should never have been cut and that it should be increased if possible. Tobacco is quite different because it is incontrovertibly bad for people: there is no evidence whatever to suggest that tobacco does anything other than seriously damage people's health. Alcohol, however, especially in moderation, can be good for people. Its abuse—a relative notion—is the problem, not its simple consumption. That distinction between tobacco and alcohol is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arguments about cross-border shopping and smuggling, and about the differential between duties in this country and those of our continental partners will continue to be debated and must be addressed. The hon.Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), who is not in his place, specifically dealt with the differential. If we continue to have the highest duties within the European Union on a free and open market, and if our near neighbours—especially France—continue to have lower duties, the problem will not be resolved. We have debated the issues but it cannot be justified to perpetuate discriminatory differences within the spirits industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that my amendment would not achieve complete equality of treatment, which is the principle behind it. Our debate has confirmed however, that I would have received even less support for a more modest measure moving in the right direction. The amendment provides an opportunity to resolve some of the differences in Committee by testing year by year the effect of the change as we take practical steps to achieve it. That is more important than the theory behind it. Taking one step at a time can help us to observe whether my arguments—supported by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
industry—will bear fruit or whether the counter-arguments will turn out to be correct. It is reasonable and proper therefore, to move forward in orderly steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the implication behind the remarks made by the hon. Member for Bristol, South. She suggested that if the amendment comprehensively equalised tax on alcohol and at the same time eliminated the gap between us and our continental partners, the Labour party would support it. That is unlikely</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As in so many other areas, the Labour party is timid and confused when faced with an issue requiring action. Labour has failed to grasp the most fundamental point—that we are talking about one of our major industries which is suffering a disadvantage that no other Government in the world would impose on a home industry of such importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would not solve the problem, but it would make a practical contribution towards its solution while demonstrating to the industry that we recognised its contribution to the economy, that we were aware of the thrust behind its representations and that we were prepared to respond.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 36, leave out from `above;' to end of line 39 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>`(c) it is delivered for home use as petrol which is suitable to be used as fuel for engines for which leaded petrol is suitable by virtue of being leaded; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) it is delivered for home use under such a description, or in such a manner, as tends, in the circumstances, to suggest that it is—
	<ol>
	<li>petrol satisfying the condition set out in paragraph (a) above; or</li>

The amendment follows extensive consultation with the trade and would add to the products constituting higher octane petrol. Perhaps I should explain for the benefit of members of the Committee that clause 4, which we will happily discuss, is a measure to protect the Revenue and the environment from an increase use of super unleaded petrol, which may be blended with other additives to make it usable in cars that require leaded petrol. The trade advised amending clause 4 so that it would better define higher octane petrol, thus ensuring that the clause is adhered to when the Bill is enacted. The trade suggested and is happy with the amendment, which should, therefore, be acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I want to ask about the amendment and to refer to the Government's approach to fiscal incentives for different road fuels. I was grateful for the Minister's explanation and understand that it arose out of discussions with the petroland motor manufacturing trade. The Labour party supports the reasons behind the clause, which, the Government would argue, is one element in their overall environmental policy to upgrade air quality, particularly in urban areas, where traffic causes much pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the Government's moves to use air quality monitoring to set out in greater detail the different elements that create pollution. We also support the requirement on local authorities in last year's Environment Bill to ensure adherence to air quality standards which are established in conjunction with the industry and the Government. I welcome the recent establishment of a new air quality monitoring station in Sheffield and the fact that other stations will be established elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the Select Committee on the Environment undertook an inquiry into volatile organic compounds. It examined the different levels of damage that were done to air quality by leaded, unleaded and super unleaded petrol, diesel and industrial and domestic processes that contribute to the serious impact of volatile organic compounds on ozone and on air pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's report welcomed the establishment of the Government's expert panel on air quality standards which has set out compliance targets for ozone, benzene and butadiene. I am not a technical expert, so I shall quote from the report. The recommended standard for ozone is
	<br><blockquote><p>`50 parts per billion average over 8 hours'</p></blockquote>
For Benzene, it is
	<br><blockquote><p>'5 parts per billion annual average, reducing to 1 part per billion'</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Benzene plays an important role with regard to super unleaded petrol and, therefore, in the Government's amendment, which tries to ensure that the extra penalty on super unleaded petrol takes effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard for 1.3 butadiene is one part per billion annual average. That is all well and good and the Select Committee was happy to endorse those standards and to welcome the Government's initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered several other issues including older vehicles, which will be dealt with later, cold vehicles and vehicles that take children to school. Such vehicles were among the most polluting because they gingered themselves up from cold in the morning and their catalytic converters did not work. We also considered speeding vehicles which emit more pollutants into the atmosphere. However, the aspect that most concerned us dealt with benzene and super-unleaded petrol. I shall quote paragraph 101 of the Select Committee report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of all the issues examined during the course of our Inquiry, the one which provoked the most intense debate was the matter of benzene in petrol."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, getting the levels right is an issue that we on the Select Committee on the Environment consider very important. I have my doubts about whether the clause—which the Government believe to be important in tackling the issue—meets the need to take action on variable polluting vehicle emissions, which we viewed with seriousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to make the issue clear for lay people, although I am sure that there are technical people in Committee who understand it better. My understanding is that if an engine is to function okay and not to make knocking noise, it has to use fuel with a sufficiently high octane rating. When unleaded petrol was introduced, the oil companies had to find a different means to achieve an acceptable octane level. Therefore, they had to raise the aromatic content of the fuel. That aromatic content is the benzene content and is, therefore, almost the most dangerous. Motorists found that unless they increased the aromatic levels to an octane level above 95—to 98—they could not get the same performance from their cars that they used to get from ordinary four-star leaded petrol. In order to get higher performance, faster, speedier, more macho cars, super unleaded petrol was introduced, but the aromatic content of such petrol is 11 per cent. higher than even leaded four-star petrol. I commented on the benzene standards that we all accept, but the benzene emissions from super unleaded petrol are 27 per cent. higher than from the ordinary unleaded premium. Opposition Members have supported tax incentives for more beneficial petrol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all quite detailed, but it must be understood that those are the reasons why super unleaded petrol—the high performance stuff—is for a type of vehicle that the Select Committee decided would be far better phased out altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Our recommendation was not to fiddle around with different fiscal incentives but to set a target for phasing out all super unleaded cars by 2004. We were disappointed that the Government did not agree with us. Paragraph 109 of the 1995 Select Committee report states that the Government disagreed with that proposal because they believed that it would impose too great a penalty on a diminishing number of vehicles in the market. Some experts believe that people's better understanding of environmental issues, of the damage that super unleaded petrol was causing and of the fact that high performance cars were unnecessary would lead to the phasing out of super unleaded cars. The conclusion that I draw from the clause and from the detailed investigations that the Select Committee undertook is that the Government are taking too piecemeal an approach to an extremely serious environmental issue of air quality, particularly in urban areas. We should be concerned with several aspects of the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that his amendment had been put together by experts in the trade; that is right because the issues are technical ones and people in the trade understand the details. Although we support the creditable producer-responsibility approach to introducing environmental standards and regulations that will stick, I make the proviso that it should exist within an overall framework of environmental standards and rigorously enforced by the Government. It would have been much better if the Government had provided for the phasing out of super unleaded cars rather than relying on the trade to do that. The Petrol Retailers Association believes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there will always be people who will buy super unleaded because it is a top performance product".</p></blockquote>
That leads me to my third reason for saying that the Government have not gone far enough in the clause. There is still a tendency to underestimate the glamour of the private car—the belief that if one can drive a car as fast as it will go, one will somehow be a bigger fish. That applies particularly to young men who feel that to show off a new car at its highest performance is a status symbol, and a macho symbol. In doing that, they totally disregard environmental considerations. Their status in society is more important to them than the collective environmental good. That is why the Government must step in with a national framework of standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 shows that the Government have failed to grasp the seriousness of the air pollution problem, not just for my constituency in Sheffield, not just for Britain and for Europe but for the world. In that context, it is surprising that although they have stressed several tax changes—including those affecting gas vehicles, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South will—they have not included in the Bill incentives to encourage the catalytic conversion of all vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee's report concluded that if the Government put the emphasis on all vehicles having catalytic converters, the pollution from emissions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
would be substantially reduced. However, there is nothing in the Bill to encourage that, though there easily could have been. The Bill does not tease out the distinction between diesel and petrol vehicles; again, that would have made a substantial difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Ministers know of other regulations that could be made to decrease levels of vehicular pollution but they are not the responsibility of the Treasury. They might concern speed and associated factors, but I will not go into detail because they are not relevant to the Bill; they are for other Departments to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to our questions and justify clause 4. Our main point is that it is a hotchpotch of tax shifts and it does not show that the Government's overall intention is to take major steps to deal with this country's air quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes a lot of sense to use the tax system to stimulate more environmentally friendly behaviour on the part of businesses and individuals. The Government have pioneered the introduction of that approach in this country and have had many successes. There is no question but that in a few short years, as a result of tax breaks for unleaded petrol, the proportion of passenger motor vehicles that are designed or adapted to take lead-free petrol has increased to around 60 per cent. That shows how effective such incentives can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) said: we must go even further, for several reasons. First, lead-free petrols—particularly super-octane lead-free petrols—have considerable environmental disadvantages that neutralise or even cancel out the advantages of eliminating lead. The hon. Lady mentioned both drawbacks to such petrols—the high aromatics content and the high benzene content. Aromatics are now established by strong statistical evidence as a major cause of asthma. Benzene, as you know, Mr Hogg, is without doubt a sinister, class one carcinogen. It is worrying that the emission of those unpleasant substances has increased, rather perversely, as a result of the otherwise benign process of reducing lead emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Catalytic converters would go a long way to solving the problem, but as the hon. Member for Hillsborough said, it will take a little time to reach the level of catalytic convertor use in this country that the Germans have achieved. Moreover, I am informed by those who know much more about these technical matters than I that catalytic converters are not effective until they have warmed up. So if they are not effective for the first five to seven miles of a journey in a motor car, and given that many journeys are less than that distance, they are not the final answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the power of the tax break to change people's behaviour has been established as a result of the Governments initiatives, but I hope that they will
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
not limit themselves to using that mechanism to reduce lead emissions and will go a little further in a number of directions. I tabled an amendment that was not selected, so I shall not speak to it, but it would have provided a tax break for oxygenated petrol. One of the interesting initiatives that has been taken to address the problems to which the hon. Lady and I have drawn attention, is the greater use of oxygenated petrol in countries with a strong tradition of good environmental practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Finland, 95 per cent. of petrol sold and consumed is oxygenated. There was an interesting experiment last summer in Vienna, which is a very polluted although lovely city, as many of us know. Oxygenated petrol was introduced at a time when the city seasonally suffers from bad pollution. There have been similar initiatives in many American states—including southern California, which has bad environmental pollution—based on incentives to use oxygenated petrol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will consider extending the use of tax breaks, which they have already used so effectively, to encourage the introduction of more environmentally friendly fuels. I hope that within that general examination there will be a place for a specific study on the role that oxygenated petrol might play in the future. It was never my intention to put my amendment to the vote: I did not want to force any particular option on the Government. It was, however, my intention at least to stimulate greater study of the matter. I hope that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General will agree that that would be a worthwhile exercise in the interests of the health of our people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr Hogg. Is it your intention that this debate should become the clause stand part debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That was not my intention. The hon.Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) tabled an amendment that was not selected. I was going to stop him speaking to his amendment, but he made a brief point and I thought that it was just as well to hear it. It is my intention to have a clause stand part debate. I hope that the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding will not make his speech again, so that we can all move on in a spirit of co-operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any hon. Member should send a message to the world that lead-free petrol is as environmentally damaging or health damaging as leaded petrol. I hope that that was not the intention of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry about the amendment is that it arises from discussions with the trade. I am not opposed to such discussions, but the way in which the trade has operated with regard to super unleaded petrol raises some anxiety. The Minister said that super unleaded petrol is produced by making additions to the petrol formulation to increase the octane rating without using lead. Much misinformation has been put about from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
many angles, so we must be careful not to fall for it. My concern about elements of the trade flows from the overwhelming evidence that they have attempted to market super unleaded petrol when it is unnecessary and undesirable. At a 12-pump petrol station it is not unusual to find at least two pumps with super unleaded petrol and only one with standard unleaded petrol and one with diesel. We are told that super unleaded petrol is for a niche market of no more than 5 per cent. of the trade, yet it is being deliberately marketed as a performance fuel for cars that do not need it, and it raises serious health questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough and I served on the Select Committee on the Environment. Representing Coventry and being a male—[Hon. Members: "A young male."] Thank you. Being a young male, the emphasis that I put on some of those issues may be different from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough. None the less, people in the trade and those who are concerned about wider environmental issues are worried about the mis-selling of environmental products. We must ensure that we do not encourage that practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek assurances from the Minister with regard to his discussions with the trade. The amendments would close the loopholes and prevent fiscal advantage through encouraging people to buy super unleaded petrol. I accept the success that has been achieved by encouraging people to use lead-free petrol and that is welcomed by everyone. But we must be reassured that the Minister has not fallen for the obvious misinformation put out by the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough talked about benzene, ozone and 1.3 butadiene as if she is an accomplished chemist. I have a rudimentary rather than a detailed, scientific understanding of the issues. The trade will happily tell us that to create super unleaded petrol the additional benzene required to raise the octane rating of unleaded petrol to 98 octane is no more than 1 per cent. What it does not tell people and hides as best it can is that, without any additives, up to 27 per cent. of benzene can be created in combustion. There is no need to put benzene into petrol in order to get benzene out of the exhaust pipe. That is the problem with super unleaded petrol. Simply by taking petroleum from a higher octane rating from the oil mix and without any addition to the petrol formulation, and massively increased benzene output through the exhaust pipe can be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need assurance from the Minister that the clause removes all fiscal incentives to purchase super unleaded petrol. There is no doubt about it: we should not use the taxation system to encourage people to buy super unleaded fuel. It is necessary for a small market niche—a part of the market that will disappear with time. We need to remove this marketing ploy that has been so disgracefully exploited by the petrol companies. Will the Minister assure us that, as a result of the clause and his amendment, the taxation system
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
will provide no incentive to encourage people to buy super unleaded fuel, which is so clearly damaging to health—possibly as damaging as leaded petrol?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hillsborough accurately described the characteristics of super unleaded petrol. Although it has the advantage of not containing lead, it nevertheless obtains its high octane rating through the use of aromatics, including benzene. The hon. Lady drew attention to the potential health hazard of benzene emissions. The Government are alert to the need to continue to reduce the use of super unleaded petrol. Super unleaded's market share is fairly low—already below 5 per cent.—and declining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some cars need super unleaded petrol. It has certainly been marketed more widely and is used in some cars although there is no mechanical requirement for it. However, there is a category of cars—made before 1991—that can only be run on super unleaded fuel. They include the Escort RS turbo, the Metro turbo, the Montego turbo, the Peugeot Mi 16, the Renault 5 turbo and the Renault 11 turbo. All those cars are possibly driven by young men, as instanced by the hon. Lady—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. May I say that my wife acquired one of those cars some years ago. I drive it from time to time, so perhaps I should declare an interest now that the Minister has identified it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We do not have vast natural sympathy for the users of those cars, but they exist. Despite my hon. Friend's interjection, we can foresee a phasing out of super unleaded petrol, as cars—like my hon. Friend's wife—get older. I stress that those cars are nearing the end of their first blush of youth—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]—unlike my hon. Friend's wife.

Legitimate and required use of super unleaded petrol for a defined category of vehicles is diminishing. That, together with increased use of catalytic converters, made the Government content with the benzene emission situation. However, that was threatened by the use of super unleaded petrol with a sodium additive, which could be used in cars requiring leaded petrol. Retailers and users of this new formulation petrol could gain the advantage of a lower rate of duty being applied to unleaded petrol, potentially opening up a much wider market. That possibility threatened not only the revenue, but a new lease of life for super unleaded petrol and consequent ill effects of benzene emissions.

That is why we drafted the clause and exposed it to consultation with the trade. There is nothing sinister about the trade's response. The aim is not to prolong the life of super unleaded against the wishes of the Committee, but to make the clause work better and
