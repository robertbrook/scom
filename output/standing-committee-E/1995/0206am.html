	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I say a little not just about clause 21, but about clauses 22 to 25 as well. All those clauses implement the second VAT simplification directive. Therefore, clause 21 is the first of a series of measures designed to simplify the operation of the VAT system, especially for businesses trading with other member states in the European Community. The United Kingdom played a leading role in negotiating the package, which represents a further step towards simplifying the VAT system—part of the Government's drive to deregulate wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Community VAT system was last substantially revised for the completion of the single market on 1 January 1993. By and large, that has worked successfully and businesses have benefited from the abolition of all fiscal frontiers. It is still necessary to press on where possible and to introduce simplification measures where feasible. The vehicles for such changes are the simplification directives which amend the core VAT directive—known as the sixth VAT directive—negotiated in 1977. The second simplification directive, to which clause 21 refers, was agreed in the spring of last year. Member states agreed to implement the changes from 1 January 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom's approach to the changes is always to try to obtain the best possible deal for our businessess in the context of the single market. For instance, we have secured an important new provision in the shape of fiscal warehousing arrangements, which will offer businesses the opportunity to trade VAT-free in certain commodities such as metals, foodstuffs and chemicals. They will therefore enjoy a cash-flow advantage while the goods remain in the warehousing regime.. The availability of fiscal
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
warehousing arrangements will aslo help to keep London in the first rank of commodity trading centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also negotiated other changes to the VAT system which should make matters easier for businesses. Those changes include standardisation of the rules for calculating VAT due on imports—we shall cover that in discussions on clause 23—and simplification of the VAT rule for process work which is carried out on goods. That is dealt with under clause 25. The measures may sound very technical—indeed, many of them are—but, nevertheless, they are of true value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most important feature of how we have implemented the changes has been our close work with trade interests and representative bodies in order to agree the finer working details of the arrangements. We have therefore undertaken extensive consultation as well as exposing draft legislation to those interested bodies. The dialogue between customs and the business community continues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 158, line 46, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(10) Regulations may provide for section 18C(2) and section I 8C(3) not to apply in cases where the Commissioners are satisfied that the services are related to goods removed from a warehousing or fiscal warehousing regime and placed in a warehousing or fiscal warehousing regime in the United Kingdom or another Member State, and such other conditions, if any, as may be specified in the regulations or the Commissioners may impose are fulfilled.",</p></blockquote>
We are in for a complicated morning's debate on VAT proposals. As the Paymaster General explained, clause 22 and schedule 2 deal with fiscal and other warehousing. They make facility for fiscal warehouses in the United Kingdom with effect from a day that is to be appointed—1 June 1996, according to customs. Schedule 2 contains the legislative changes to the Value Added Tax Act 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the proposals is that chain transactions in commodities have been a problem in the single market. Up to 31 December 1992 trading in commodities escaped VAT while the commodities were kept in customs warehousing regimes. From 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1995, however, that could not technically be done for goods that were considered to be in free circulation in the European Community. That meant that traders who bought and sold goods could be legally obliged to register where the goods were situated. In practice, most states did not pursue the registration requirements—hardly a satisfactory solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second VAT simplification directive, which did not simplify much—it did quite the reverse—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
introduces fiscal warehousing to allow trading in a country to be sheltered from VAT on terms that are similar to those for customs warehousing. Not all European Community countries, however, have customs warehousing regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new United Kingdom law comes into effect on 1 June 1996. The law and the directive specify a restricted range of goods to which fiscal warehousing will apply. Those include most traded metals apart from gold, as well as basic foodstuffs, wool, certain bulk chemicals and mineral and vegetable oils. Those are defined according to the tariff codes that are used for Intrastat purposes. The Value Added Tax Act 1994 will be amended by statutory instrument and will treat supplies of unallocated or unascertained goods in fiscal warehouses as supplies of goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in other warehousing regimes, customs will authorise and control warehouse keepers and will be able to take many factors into account and impose conditions. A fiscal warehouse is defined as a place. Despite the reference to a singular premise, however, customs will allow a warehouse keeper to specify several premises as his warehouse. Warehouse keepers are liable for VAT on goods that are missing or found to be deficient before removal from the regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No VAT need be paid on the purchase or acquisition of goods that are to be placed in the fiscal warehouse, provided that the purchaser or the acquirer prepares a certificate to say that the goods will go into the regime. No VAT is due on supplies of the goods while in the regime. When the goods leave the regime, however, the person removing them must account for the VAT on the value of the last supply or acquisition into or under the warehousing regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, the remover is registered for United Kingdom VAT, he accounts for the VAT on his next VAT return. An unregistered person is still liable to pay VAT on removal and must pay VAT at the time of removal, as with VAT on goods coming out of customs or excise warehouses. The removals do not count towards VAT registration limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain services related to goods in any type of warehouse will be zero-rated from 1 June 1996. These include the warehouse keeper's storage charges, permitted work on goods in customs, and any physical work on goods in a fiscal warehousing regime, unless prohibited by regulation. The recipient of the service must give a certificate, except for supplies by the warehouse keeper of warehousing the goods, and penalties equal to the VAT otherwise' due can be imposed for incorrect certificates. The person removing the goods from the warehouse must account for VAT on services supplied since the last supply of goods within the warehouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to 31 December 1995, processing of goods in warehousing regimes was zero-rated as it was treated as supply of goods. The amendment seeks to clarify the difficulties with the new regime. Regulations will be made in the United Kingdom to allow VAT-free
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
transfer of goods from a United Kingdom fiscal warehousing regime to another such regime, whether in the United Kingdom or in another EC country. However, VAT will still be due on services rendered after the last supply within the United Kingdom warehouse. That may cause difficulty for non-United Kingdom removers of goods. It is likely that a concession will be sought in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interaction of the fiscal warehouse regime with zero-rating under the terminal markets order is currently under discussion. There are various problems. Not all member states have warehousing regimes that allow VAT-free supplies in the warehouse, so they may not all have fiscal warehousing regimes. The restriction of commodities limits the usefulness of the regime. The provisions are not retrospective and thus leave transactions between 1 January 1993 and the date of implementation in a legal limbo. I would like the Paymaster General to explain how that will be dealt with, though it is hoped that no action will be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require regulations to be made to allow VAT-free transfer of goods from a United Kingdom fiscal warehousing regime to another such regime in the United Kingdom or another EC country. However, VAT will be due on related services rendered after the last supply of goods in the first fiscal warehousing regime. Such VAT may cause difficulties for non-United Kingdom removers of goods. The amendment is intended to prevent such VAT charges arising on the supply of related services when goods are transferred between fiscal warehousing regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful if the Paymaster General could explain whether other European states will be introducing a similar relief, if they have not already done so, and over what time period it will be implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I set out in my introductory remarks the benefits of the introduction of a warehousing regime throughout the Community. The directive will apply in all the countries of the European Union. It is up to other countries to pass the directive's provisions into law in the same way that we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot comment directly on other countries' mechanisms and laws, except to say that the United Kingdom negotiated the directive in order to get an equivalence of treatment throughout the single market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can explain what powers and action he will take if other European countries do not follow a similar route. As has been noted, some European countries do not have bonded warehouses and so lack the cornerstone for the edifice of the directive. What action will the Minister take if everyone is not playing the same game?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive is designed directly to ensure that other countries have equivalent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
warehousing regimes. If they do not they will be in breach of the directive and liable to infraction proceedings. No one is keener than I to ensure that directives affecting other countries are observed. I do not want to underestimate the complexity of the VAT system. It is not easy to set up a warehousing regime, or even to amend existing regimes. It is better to take a few extra months and get something right than always to implement it from the date specified in the directive. However, that does not contradict the general point that the directive's purpose is to complete this part of the single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, which would ensure that goods transferred between warehouses do not trigger a tax liability in respect of the services provided in those warehouses that have been relieved of VAT, is unnecessary because the Bill's regulation-making powers are designed to ensure that the existing system is carried over to the new regime. I hope that the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) will accept that, although I accept that the amendment makes a fair point in seeking to ensure that the existing VAT-free privilege available to traders is carried forward. The directive means that that privilege applies to our traders operating in other member states. It also ensures that traders elsewhere will get those rights when they trade within the United Kingdom's warehousing systems. We are anxious to preserve London as a centre of trading in a number of precious metals which are mentioned in schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like more time to consider the Minister's argument. There is no point in pressing an amendment when its purpose is already covered, and I accept what the Minister has said so far.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a point about the value of consultation. Customs and Excise consulted widely on these complex provisions. The Institute of Taxation noted that the draft legislation did not originally provide a right of appeal—it now does. It also pointed out that new section 18B (c) (2) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 was unintelligible in earlier drafts, but is now much simpler.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever possible—indeed, in almost all circumstances—it is beneficial for Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue to consult widely. I have provided two clear examples of where improvements were made even before the Bill came before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Schedule 2 agreed to.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>VALUE OF IMPORTED GOODS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a query with the Paymaster General. The clause amends the value of goods for import VAT purposes. Import VAT will now be charged on goods arriving from outside the European Union. All incidental expenses to the first place of destination in the United Kingdom and up to the final destination of goods anywhere within the EU—in so far as that is known at the time of import—are taken into account. Incidental expenses include commission, packing, insurance and transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously, the value of import VAT included such expenses only up to the port or place of importation. Customs has issued an information paper which details how the extra costs should be declared and gives advice on what to do if the cost to the first United Kingdom destination is not known at the time of import. since the incidental costs are now included in the import value, charges to importers should be zero-rated. Under United Kingdom law, they are already zero-rated under the terms of group 8, of schedule 8 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994—except for insurance, which is exempt. Failure to declare the correct import value is a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we are dealing with complex procedures. I understand why Customs and Excise has said that it will adopt a light touch, at least in the initial period, to policing the system. Will the Paymaster General expand on what is meant by a light touch and for how many months it will apply? What will happen at the end of the initial period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South about incidental expenses. I have had discussions with the Federation of Small Businesses and I know that it is worried about the current definition, which it considers to be woolly and not concise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make two points that emerge from representations forwarded to me as a member of the Committee. First, I heard from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, requesting guidance on how to interpret the first phrase of section 21 (2) (c) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 about the time of importation and on how to determine whether a further destination of goods is known. It was told by customs:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of the new legislation the time of importation is the time at which a customs debt becomes due, or would have become due if the goods were subject to duty."</p></blockquote>
That is a helpful clarification. Could the Minister confirm that that is also his interpretation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comment of the Institute of Indirect Taxation on the clause begins—perhaps strangely for a professional body:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are unclear as to the purpose of this provision."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is expressed to be a simplification measure. However, it seems to increase the value on importation, and thus the VAT payable at that stage, by internal transport costs within the common market. As VAT can be payable on such costs this appears to create double taxation. At the time of importation the incidental expenses may well not have been incurred. It is not clear if in such circumstances an amount needs to be estimated and if so how. It also clearly adds an extra administrative burden."</p></blockquote>
I should welcome the Minister's response to those comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 23 introduces two changes to the method of calculating VAT on goods imported from outside the EC. That is necessary to align our law with the relevant part of the sixth VAT directive, as amended by the simplification directive that I have described, and standardises the arrangements across the single market for taxing services linked to the import of goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would perhaps be helpful to the Committee—and to me—to know whether Britain is the first country to attempt to introduce the directive into its fiscal legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All countries were obliged to implement it from 1 January this year. The directive has been negotiated over the past months; it was not suddenly foisted upon unexpecting member states. I can assure the hon. Lady that we are not the only country trying to introduce the changes, which the Community unanimously agreed as constituting a simplifying measure for the operation of the single market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Value for import VAT should, under EC law, include incidental expenses—and I shall give examples for the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson)—such as commission, packing, transport and insurance costs incurred up to the goods' first destination in the United Kingdom. In its present form, British law does not always achieve that objective and the amendment corrects that. Additionally, if a further destination for the goods, in Britain or the Community, is known at the time of importation, incidental costs arising from transport to that destination should also be included in the value of import VAT. That was formerly an option for member states in respect of further destinations within their own territory, but there is now a clear, consistent rule for use throughout the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about difficulties in introducing the new valuation provisions. It is true that the existing inconsistencies, in Britain and other member states, have created technical questions that Customs and Excise are anxious to answer, working in conjunction with trade interests. We firmly believe—and I think that the Committee agrees—that we have nevertheless a genuine simplification measure. For example, a haulier who offers his services in other member states has, until now, had to deal with the different tax administrations in each country in which he operates. Indeed, various rates of VAT may be applicable in
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
those countries. The directive adopts a common, consistent approach for all member states to ensure equality of treatment and to avoid the risks either of there being no taxation or double taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, however, that customs must work pragmatically with trade interests—as they have since the beginning of the year—to implement the provisions. That is the importance of the so-called "light touch", which means that when a trader innocently fails to operate the new rules, he or she will not be penalised, at least not until that innocent failure becomes a wilful disregard of agreed rules.

Consultation—to pick up a point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith)—is about not merely framing the rules in the first place, but implementing them in practice. We do not want to take an adversarial approach against traders who are endeavouring to operate new rules in an admittedly complex area and, therefore, we shall not be introducing penalties in the first few months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an importer seeks to evade tax by failing to operate rules that he or she knows to be required, that would not fall into the category of an innocent failure to implement those rules and we would not operate a light touch in those circumstances. However, I want to assure members of the Committee that in the first few months of operation of the new rules, when there may be genuine questions about correct valuation and what expenses are to be added to imported goods, customs will operate a light touch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 14, leave out line 1 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) In subsection (1) of section 22 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, for the words 'the supply had been' there shall be substituted the words 'the value of the supply was equal to the value of.".</p></blockquote>
Clause 24 repeals section 22 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, which effected the conversion of zero-rated aircraft and hovercraft to craft for the use of recreation or pleasure as a supply for a non-registered customer or for non-registered business purposes. The value of the conversion was deemed to be the full value of the aircraft or hovercraft. As a result, it is now possible for private purchasers of large aircraft to avoid paying VAT on the full cost of buying a zero-rated aircraft and paying VAT only on the conversion costs.

	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
Section 22 was intended to stop people purchasing privately commercial aircraft and then converting them for recreational or pleasure use while paying VAT only on the cost of conversion. As a result of section 22, a private purchaser had to pay VAT on the full cost of the aircraft, including conversion. The amendment would revise section 22 so that it complies with the European Union second VAT simplification directive although retaining the anti-avoidance provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment misses the point. It is directed at refining section 22 of the 1994 Act, but clause 24 provides for the repeal of the entire section, which is no longer needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 22 has rather an interesting origin, The last Labour Government introduced a luxury rate of VAT at 25 per cent. We all remember that. That luxury rate, imposed on items such as white goods—fridges and so on—hi-fi equipment, radios, televisions and photographic equipment, meant that the Government felt it necessary to introduce an anti-avoidance provision to stop people buying goods liable at the lower rate and having them converted into higher rated goods. In that way, they paid the higher rate on the cost of conversion only rather than on the original goods. That proves that avoidance is not new. The measure was eventually carried over into a provision to stop people buying aircraft and hovercraft for business use, which is zero-rated, and adapting them for private use so avoiding the standard rate of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we reviewed the section, we found that its provisions were simply unnecessary. They had never been used. I am sure that the Committee will agree that if we can find ways to prune the existing body of legislation and the quantity of statute law with which practitioners have to deal, we should always do so. That is why the amendment is unnecessary. On reflection, the hon. Lady might care not to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister talk in specific terms? He mentioned the Labour Government, aircraft and hovercraft, but have I understood correctly? At present, if an aircraft or hovercraft is bought for commercial use and is subsequently converted for pleasure use, VAT is payable only on the conversion cost. Clearly, there would appear to be an advantage in taking that route. That seems bizarre. Is that the case and, if so, is it right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case, but it is not altered by the legislation under consideration. The hon. Gentleman touches on a different issue. His comments are correct. If he feels that the VAT treatment is wrong, perhaps a new clause or an amendment might be appropriate. However, that does not alter the fact that amendment No. 76, which deals with a slightly different issue, is unnecessary or that its provisions have not, in practicee, been used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue almost brings me back to classic cars, which was one of my boyhood passions. We heard in the news recently of two amateurs in the north of England who had built and launched space rockets—perhaps space rockets is the wrong term because they did not get into space. In a successful launch last week one of the rockets reached 3,000 ft: it was a prototype of a rocket that it is hoped will get into orbit. Do spacecraft count as aircraft? If so, do they have to get out of the atmosphere to count as such?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When an amateur engages in a serious scientific exercise, does the spacecraft bear VAT costs? Is it right to burden gifted amateurs who have to fight against the Ariane project and NASA? When a man has raised £40,000 on his own to achieve something as spectacular as last week's launch, should he pay 17.5 per cent. extra to the Government for the privilege of flying Britain's flag in space when official Government programmes are exempt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause repeals paragraph 2 of schedule 4 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, which deems "processing" to be a supply of goods produced by processing. Taking up an option in the directive, it inserts section 30(2A) into the 1994 Act to allow a supplier to zero rate the service of processing of goods if the goods should be zero-rated under schedule 8 of the 1994 Act and if the supplier of those services is supplying those goods to the customer to whom he is supplying the services. That effectively preserves the status quo—particularly in the food and printing industries—and it extends the special scheme for gold to include the processing of gold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the required changes will be included in statutory instruments at a later stage. One change that has been made is the withdrawal of a concession. Under the clause, it will no longer be possible to zero-rate repair or other work on goods performed in the United Kingdom for an overseas business customer if the goods do not leave the United Kingdom. That change may cause significant problems for third parties undertaking warranty work for overseas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
manufacturers, although United Kingdom distributors of goods being repaired fortunately do not have that problem. Any recharge of cost to the manufacturer is treated as outside the scope of VAT in compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuers of goods in the United Kingdom may have a similar problem. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would explain whether that is likely to be a significant problem for third parties undertaking warranty work. If so, what does he intend to do about it? If he does not consider it a problem, why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 25 intoduces, again from 1 January, certain amendments concerning the VAT treatment of process or repair work carried out on a customer's materials or goods. The aim is to simplify the VAT treatment of process or repair work on customer's materials or goods by providing that such work should always be regarded as a supply of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously, member states had the option of treating such repair work as a supply of goods. We took up that option, which is why we are now amending the law. Standardisation will clarify the treatment as well as simplifying matters for businesses operating across the Community. The hon. Lady will agree that the provision will make it easier for businesses seeking repair or process work in other countries, and for those in other countries doing the same here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential difficulty can be illustrated by the example of the printing of paper supplied by a customer. Previously, because that was considered to be a supply of goods, it attracted the same zero rate that books attract. On the face of it, the change to treating such process work as a supply of services at a standard rate could have meant that the customer supplying the paper for printing would have been charged at that rate rather than at the previous zero rate. To prevent that, we have exercised an option in the directive to maintain the zero rate. So although the process work in the example that I gave is now regarded as a supply of services, the nature of the work involved and the finished product mean that it will continue to attract the zero rate that applied previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consulted with businesses on the proposal. They were strongly in favour of the simplifying measure and of maintaining the status quo in respect of the rates. We are not disturbing the zero rates that apply in practice in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady will accept the assurance that this is a welcome and simplifying measure for businesses in this country and overseas. It also maintains our unique structure of zero rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REFUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH CONSTRUCTION AND CONVERSION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 15, line 28, after "purpose", insert "or relevant charitable purpose".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 75, in page 15, leave out lines 32 to 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 26 deals with refunds in connection with construction and conversion. The amendments focus on the clause's impact on the definitions of "relevant residential purpose" and of "relevant charitable purpose".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With effect from the Bill gaining Royal Assent, the clause will amend section 35 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 to allow VAT refunds that are incurred by DIY housebuilders and others who are not in business and who convert certain buildings for residential use. The new section gives statutory effect to a concession arrangement for dwellings that was announced in July 1994. Existing relief will continue where building materials are used to construct dwellings and buildings with a residential or charitable purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law is rephrased more straightforwardly in new subsections (1A) and (1B). VAT on building materials and construction services that are used in residential conversions can now be recovered. Residential conversions are defined as the conversion of a nonresidential building into a dwelling or dwellings or into a building with relevant residential purpose, such as a children's or old people's home or student halls of residence. Such conversions do not, however, include conversions into a building that is intended solely for a relevant charitable purpose. It is difficult to understand why new section 35(1E) is required because relevant charitable purpose is not included in new section 35(1D). Conversions to buildings with relevant charitable purposes are not eligible for relief in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government exclude dwellings or relevant residential purpose dwellings that also have a relevant charitable purpose, they will discriminate against charities. A hospice that is run by a charity on a non-business basis could not claim relief for the conversion of buildings into new hospice accommodation. That is an unjustifiable restriction on relief—an impression that is shared by the Institute of Indirect Tax Practitioners and the Institute of Taxation, both of which have sought confirmation that such a restriction will not be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would amend section 35 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 to allow refunds where VAT is incurred by DIY housebuilders and others who are not in business. It would ensure that relief and assistance to hospice accommodation continues after

conversion by allowing builders to recover input VAT on the cost of converting buildings into relevant charitable buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South. Will the Minister clarify the discrepancy in regard to input VAT for buildings that are converted for charitable rather than residential purposes. The Minister should be aware that my constituency covers a huge area of outlying moorlands on the fringes of Sheffield, close to a number of small communities. Many barns and buildings were formerly used for agricultural purposes and questions are continually raised about their future use. Often, they transpose into residential dwellings under current provisions on VAT. They are also often viewed by local communities, which may operate charities, in terms of their potential charitable use. Unless the problem is solved, that might pose an added serious complication concerning how individuals and communities view the buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall wait to hear the Minister's reply and if there are further relevant questions outstanding, I shall probe him further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my constituency there is an old decaying hospital founded by William Pickles Hartley, the jam magnate. The hospital closed in 1989 and has been slowly rotting and disintegrating ever since. It had no use and the regional health authority sold it to a private builder. At an early stage, however, there was a possibility that the hospital might be purchased by Burnley and Pendle hospice association. I negotiated with it and asked it seriously to consider purchasing that old hospital, but it told me that the cost of conversion would be too great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, as a result of splendid fund raising efforts, the association is constructing a new hospice from scratch at the Burnley end of my constituency. Had the concession been available during my discussions with it 18 months to two years ago, it might well have tipped the balance. The old hospital would then have been restored for community use as a living hospice, if that is not a contradiction in terms. I support the clause as amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My colleagues have mentioned constituency issues and I wish to ask the Minister another specific constituency issue. I am well connected with Nottingham Help the Homeless. It is a voluntary organisation and it runs on a shoestring—every penny counts for it. It does a considerable amount of conversion work, using volunteers to adapt buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the organisation was to convert a building and use it solely for residential purposes, it would not, under the terms of clause 26 (1) (e), be able to reclaim VAT. However, if the building was converted into a day centre—rather than for residential use—VAT could be reclaimed. Will the Minister confirm that that is correct? If there is a disparity between what a charitable body can reclaim on VAT on residential use in comparison with other uses that is an inconsistency that could make life difficult for charitable bodies. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
that is correct, it is important that amendments Nos. 74 and 75 are adopted. Perhaps the Minister will reconsider them. The proposed provisions seem to complicate the situation for charitable organisations. Nottingham Help the Homeless wants to give residential and day care to people, and it does not seem right that it should be disadvantaged. As I understand it, our amendments would set clause 26 right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up my hon. Friend's questions. Will the Minister define the difference between a dwelling and a building that is provided for a "relevant residential purpose"? Does it have to do with people sleeping in the building over night, or would it be possible to regard a building that provides shelter from the elements during the day as a residential building?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central Methodist church in my constituency recently responded to the needs of the homeless by setting up a day centre, in effect, for homeless people who sleep on the streets at night. It provides breakfast and a meeting point for outreach social workers and young people in particular. Part of the church had to be converted for that purpose. Under clause 26, would a church running a similar scheme in future be able to reclaim VAT if members of the congregation did the conversion themselves on a voluntary basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also aware that quite a few small voluntary bodies are, as part of the care in the community programme, converting and adapting buildings for use as small group homes in the community for people with learning difficulties or for those who have or are recovering from mental illness. Would they be excluded by the provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am reading clause 26 correctly, it seems bizarre that someone who wants to convert a barn in the countryside for a second home would be able to do so, in certain circumstances, exempt from VAT but a charity that is trying to provide a home for someone who would otherwise be homeless would have to pay VAT. Surely that cannot be the Government's intention. Will the Minister say whether my reading of the clause is right? If so, will the Government consider bringing forward proposals to remove the anomaly of tax breaks being given for second homes while taxation is imposed on charities that are trying to work with the homeless?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I answer the specific points that were raised in the debate, perhaps I may explain a little about the background to clause 26. It is intended to change DIY relief, although the debate has gone wider than that, which is understandable. It is only the latest part of a series of deregulatory measures that will affect VAT on construction works. Although some of the examples that were used are probably not instances of do-it-yourself, I can answer the debate in the more general context of that series of measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the themes of the changes to VAT on construction has been to reduce the VAT that was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
charged on work done to existing buildings when the result of the work was a new dwelling. Before July 1994, any work done to a building was taxable, regardless of whether it had been converted to a residence, a hospice or a day centre. So we have implemented several relieving measures, of which that is only the latest. I think that the Committee would welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows an individual to recover VAT paid on a barn conversion, for example, just as a commercial developer reclaims the VAT payable on such conversions as an old factory into flats. On 1 March last year, the VAT law was amended, after a debate on the Floor of the House, to give effect to earlier provisions. Importantly, charities are not discriminated against in any way. If they convert a non-residential building into a residential home for the mentally ill or the homeless, or into a hospice, they will be relieved in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, however, we decided not to include other charity conversions in the new relief. For VAT purposes, charities are treated in exactly the same way as anyone else. They will all be eligible to claim the conversion relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I want to answer his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may ask why we do not allow relief to all conversions carried out by charities. I remind the hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley), in particular, that there are about 170,000 registered charities and tens of thousands that are unregistered. He and some of his hon. Friends say that all those charities should be able to reclaim all the VAT costs on any conversion they carry out—converting a factory into offices for non-business use, for example. It is impossible to distinguish between charities. If the amendment were to be passed, it would help good causes and, for example, public schools. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman intends to allow a public school to set up a new office for non-business purposes, perhaps by converting another office, to reclaim VAT. Apart from anything else, it would be impossible for Customs and Excise to police because while the end product of a residential home is evident and visible, the conversion of an office into another office may simply involve redecoration; recouping VAT on that may facilitate its sale on a privileged basis. Such abuses would soon appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore right to provide relief only on conversions that provide residential accommodation. That concept is widely drawn; several of the examples—such as a home for the mentally ill—that were put to me would fall within it. A day centre, however, would not qualify because the existing zero rate for accommodation requires permanent residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that if a private individual or the villagers of Dungworth
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
wanted to convert a barn to use as a small meeting room or as a place of worship for a church group, that would not be eligible, unless they provided living accommodation, for somebody to sleep there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady repeats my point. I assume that the organisation doing the conversion in her case is a charity. For charities, the relief provided by legislation is available only if the end product is for residential accommodation. It is not available if the conversion is to provide offices, meeting centres or day centres. That decision is consistent with the measures introduced last year for more general conversion costs. Therefore, we are making DIY conversion expenses consistent with the earlier decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has attributed to me and my hon. Friends a line of argument that we were not adopting. We were not arguing that a charity creating an office block out of a factory should be exempt. We were expressing concern that the manner in which the clause is drafted will uniquely disadvantage charities engaged in providing a dwelling or dwellings or buildings for residential purposes in a way that would not disadvantage others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 26(1E) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A conversion of a building … is not a residential conversion for the purposes of this section to the extent that it is the conversion of a building or part of a building into anything intended for use solely for a relevant charitable purpose."</p></blockquote>
The conversion by a charity of a building for residential use—the group home for the mentally handicapped that I mentioned, for example—could and would be considered as for use solely for charitable purpose. Therefore, the charity might be unable to reclaim the VAT and might suffer if the matter went to a tribunal because of the drafting of the clause, although other bodies would not. The Minister told us that if the conversion was commercial—let us say turning a factory into flats—the developer would be able to reclaim VAT, although, hitherto, do-it-yourselfers have not been able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the provision intends to allow do-it-yourselfers the same status as developers registered for VAT in reclaiming the VAT. That is commendable enough, but if the do-it-yourselfers are the congregation of a church who want to convert a church building into a vicarage or a church hall into a hostel for the homeless, it would appear that they would be uniquely exempted from the ability to reclaim VAT. I am quite happy to accept that that might not have been the Government's intention, but, as I read the clause, that is what it achieves, and that is why my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South tabled an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it cannot be right to give tax exemption to people converting a holiday home in the countryside for themselves, but not to give the same concession to a charity which provides housing for people with no first home, let alone a second home, who would otherwise be homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to conversions used for residential purposes on a temporary basis. From time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
to time, Crisis at Christmas converts office buildings to provide shelter from the cold for homeless people during the Christmas and new year period. Obviously, there are short-term costs in making the necessary conversions. Those conversions would be undertaken by a charity. Residential accommodation would be provided for a short period. In those circumstances, would Crisis at Christmas be able to reclaim the VAT costs of a short-term conversion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to probe the Minister about a case that I have in mind. The example involves a person who wants to convert—on a DIY basis and with charitable intent—a disused building in the countryside for use as a small education centre at which perhaps 10 or 11 schoolchildren, with the agreement of the local authority, could study nature. Is a refund of input VAT allowable in that case? Does the answer depend on whether proper residential accommodation is part of that development?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are crucial matters because the incorporation of proper residential accommodation in such a development has a different—even an opposite—significance in terms of planning regulations. The Government may consider that their VAT regulations encourage the conversion of disused buildings into residential accommodation, but the effect of the planning regulations is just the reverse. Planning regulations militate against disused buildings being used for residential purposes as opposed to any other charitable use that might benefit the community. There is a contradiction there that I should like the Minister to clarify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to prolong the debate, but I want to return to Nottingham Help the Homeless. As I said, that charity operates on a shoestring. I have often sat in on meetings at which the people who run the charity have talked about projects that they have no money to realise. I do not want to go into the philosophy of linguistics, but often the members of that charity, when discussing how something is to be achieved, will say, "We're going to do it ourselves. We, as a charitable and voluntary organisation, will get together to convert a building using our own labour and resources".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am clear that Nottingham Help the Homeless is a do-it-yourself organisation, but I am less clear about some matters on which my hon. Friend the Member for York began to touch. Now that community care exists, a range of new projects are being set up in which it is difficult to make the distinction between residential care and day care. My hon. Friend used the example of Crisis at Christmas, which provides some residential care but which also provides a lot of day care during poor weather. Similarly, Nottingham Help the Homeless runs a variety of projects, including what they call a "wet centre" for heavy drinkers that is open from early morning to late evening. The charity converted the old warehouse used for that centre from its own resources. In such cases, are charities eligible to reclaim VAT on the material that they use?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
May I take the Minister to the Albion centre, which is just round the corner from the night shelter? It provides overnight care and care during the day. Homeless people pick and mix: they come and go and the time of the day does not always mean much to them. That centre is a conversion to an old church, which was carried out by the organisation to provide a mixture of day care and residential accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In light of our discussion, I am not clear on which projects Nottingham Help the Homeless and other charitable bodies can now reclaim VAT. These issues are important for charitable organisations because many of them have little money. They want to do more and need to be convinced that the Minister wants to help them. I am sure that he does, and I hope that he will explain the position. If not, perhaps he will talk to us further about this issue at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is familiar with the fact that building conversion costs have always attracted VAT: that has been the case since VAT was introduced in 1973—all through the last Labour Government—and is generally the case today. However, we recently moved to give relief in some instances, specifically to ensure that conversion costs of non-residential buildings into flats, homes or any other permanent residences were relieved of VAT. That new measure was welcomed. It applies whoever does the conversion, and charities do, indeed, carry out many such good works. What we are discussing is whether to extend or complete that by applying it to DIY conversions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to prevent charities being disadvantaged. They have, however, been granted a concession for works involving conversions into buildings that they may use for other purposes. That is similar to the wording of the amendment, which Opposition Members clearly support. However, "charitable purpose" has a wide meaning. The hon. Member for Hillsborough, and other Opposition Members, gave examples of day centres for alcoholics or the homeless. But "charitable purpose" also means any purpose by any charity. Therefore, the amendment would help the 170,000 or more registered charities if they converted a factory or old office building into a building that they used for business purposes. So it would help public schools that were setting up offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that is presumably not what Opposition Members want to achieve, they have not shown how a distinction should be drawn between those conversions and the day centres that they are trying to help. The law must be horizontally applied to all charities in the same way, unless it is made clear that certain types of charities are to be deregistered or deemed not to be charities. In the past, the Opposition have suggested that education should not be a charitable purpose. They withdrew under pressure from that line of inquiry. If they are suggesting that that argument should be reintroduced and enacted in another way, they must draw the correct distinction between the charities that they want to help and those that they do not. In the absence of that distinction, I cannot accept the amendment.

I repeat, however, that zero rating will apply to all conversions to residential use when there is an element of permanence that makes them compatible with the general zero rating applied to housing and homes under VAT law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like the Minister to deal more specifically with subsection (1E). A few years ago, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity in my constituency, converted a cocoa warehouse into flats for rent. The conversion could be described therefore as
	<br><blockquote><p>"intended for use solely for a relevant charitable purpose."</p></blockquote>
Under subsection (1E), if such use is intended, then:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A conversion of a building … is not a residential conversion".</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members are concerned that charities could be uniquely disadvantaged. A private developer who converted the building would be eligible to reclaim VAT. But a VAT tribunal could say that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation had created a conversion solely for relevant charitable purposes so it was not eligible for a refund. I do not believe that that was the Government's intention, but that is what the clause provides, which is why my hon. Friends are trying to amend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The conversion by a charity or anyone else into flats of an old cocoa warehouse no longer required for its original purpose will be relieved.

The existing provision for VAT grouping rests on a derogation in article 4(4) of the sixth directive. It allows groups of bodies that are closely financially linked to be treated as a single taxable person so that all transactions between them are VAT free. Under clause 27, certain transactions between VAT group members would not be VAT free. It therefore deviates from the derogation in article 4(4) of the sixth directive and cannot be enacted without a further derogation, which would have to be authorised by the European Commission under article 27 of the directive.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 60 deals with appeals against direction. Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 deal with the power of direction that is conferred on customs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause and schedule 3 bring in extensive anti-avoidance legislation. Its wide-ranging intention makes it extremely complex. The new law gives considerable discretion to customs with what could be much uncertainty for taxpayers. I want to address those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new anti-avoidance provisions give customs draconian powers of direction which allow it to act both retrospectively and prospectively. I shall return to that, as it is the subject of later amendments. The provisions deal particularly with supplies between VAT group members, which are subject to VAT, and have been made between ungrouped companies. The direction covers any supply and almost any period, including periods before 29 November 1995. The only requirement is that the directions be issued within six years of the later relevant event. Again, we will discuss what constitutes a relevant event under a later clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the necessary conditions are satisfied, therefore, customs could, in principle, issue a direction that
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
treats a VAT-grouped company as having been outside the group since VAT started in 1973. There is no requirement for that direction to be limited to the transactions or periods related to the VAT scheme that is being attacked. It appears—and I am sure that it will be the case—that customs will be careful in its use of those powers. Nevertheless, the directions are substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs can issue directions only when reasonably precise conditions are satisfied. First, there must be a relevant event, which is defined as a company joining or leaving a group, or a company entering into any transaction that occurs after 28 November 1995. As a result of the relevant event, there is or may be a supply on which VAT is charged otherwise than on the full value. The use of the term "full value" has proved somewhat confusing. It is not intended to imply market value, but rather the amount of VAT on the value of the supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, customs must not give a direction if it is satisfied that all the main purposes of the relevant event were genuine commercial purposes unconnected with VAT avoidance. It is therefore important that companies document carefully their commercial reasons for making changes to VAT groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effects of direction and assessment are particular. Where, under a direction, changes are made to the group or to specified supplies, all the normal consequences will follow. For example, input tax created by newly taxing previously untaxed supplies will be deductible, subject to the normal rules, even though no VAT invoices were issued at the time of supply. Customs can assess for extra output VAT due and input VAT overclaimed as a result of the direction up to one year after the direction is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, the rights of appeal against a direction need to be very clear indeed. Under the draft legislation, taxpayers can appeal against a direction on two grounds: that the main purpose of the relevant event was genuinely commercial and unconnected with the VAT avoidance; or that it was unreasonable—not just incorrect—of customs to consider that the conditions for a direction were satisfied. The requirement to prove unreasonable behaviour by customs would appear to be somewhat unwarranted. Surely the conditions should be factual and subject to review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 deals specifically with appeals. The appeals provisions appear to be too limited and may contravene European law which requires member states to have an adequate procedure to allow taxpayers to appeal against incorrectly charged tax. In our view, the appeal provisions should be as wide as possible, with the onus on customs and the Government to justify any restriction in appeal rights. Customs should not be afraid to submit to the scrutiny of the tribunal in that respect. The tribunal should be able to decide whether the conditions for a direction to be made are satisfied, rather than being confined to reviewing customs decisions on the matter and only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
overturning them if they are unreasonable. It would be a small consolation to a taxpayer if customs had been reasonable but wrong in their direction because they were not in possession of all the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendments Nos. 61 and 62 were accepted, the conditions under which customs can make a direction would need to be essentially factual. There must have been a relevant event leading to a supply on which VAT had not been charged in full, but in respect of which input VAT had been claimed. In addition, no direction could be made if the relevant event was undertaken for genuine commercial purposes. Those matters are not for customs' discretion. Either the conditions are satisfied by VAT or they are not. Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 aim to deal with that proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to pre-empt my hon. Friend's comments. I know that he takes an interest in these matters. However, I thought that it would be for the benefit of the Committee were Ito set out the thinking behind a complicated piece of taxation. Its intention is comparatively simple. I shall then respond more specifically to the points made by the hon. Member for Bristol, South as well as to the thinking of some of my hon. Friends, to judge from amendments tabled by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as a whole deals with anti-avoidance and VAT grouping. Grouping provisions originated in the introduction of VAT in 1973. They are widely acknowledged to have a deregulatory effect and to assist businesses of all sizes. They allow associated companies to submit only one VAT return rather than one for each group member. Internal supplies, such as staff costs recharged within the group, between members of a VAT group are also ignored—or disregarded—for VAT purposes. When that facility is properly used, it puts members of individual companies in a group on the same footing as competitors who choose to trade as single companies organised on divisional lines. That saves trading groups the extra expense of an estimated £400 million a year in VAT and the associated accountancy costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause and the related schedule are not designed to recoup any part of that cost for the Exchequer. Rather, we seek to abolish avoidance schemes that exact tax benefits well beyond those intended; such benefits which are not available to individually registered companies and traders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The international comparison is interesting. Adoption of the grouping facility is not mandatory under EC rules and only five member states have adopted it—Denmark, Germany, Austria, Ireland and the Netherlands—some of which do not give companies the option to form groups in the way that we do. All of them have found it necessary to impose
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
special conditions to counter abuse. Some states, such as Germany, use compulsory grouping powers much wider than those we seek to adopt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that, under the sixth directive, those countries have a similar derogation to ours.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it is, but to satisfy the hon. Gentleman I will take further advice and, if necessary, I will write to him. I believe that his fear is groundless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years, it has become apparent that a minority of users are willing to manipulate the grouping rules in furtherance of VAT avoidance schemes. Such schemes are marketed by an increasingly active VAT avoidance industry; some of those organisations make no secret of the fact that the grouping rules have been especially favourable to their products. The schemes have no commercial purpose other than reducing input VAT on supplies received that would not be recoverable under the normal rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, a VAT group—as any other registered business—will buy in goods or services from external sources and pay VAT. Normally, that VAT—known as input tax—may be offset against the VAT recovered from customers. However, in some instances full credit of the input tax is not allowed. For example, it might have been incurred in the course of a business activity that is VAT exempt, such as the provision of various banking, financial or insurance services, or it might have been charged on the purchase of cars by the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A simplified example will illustrate the point. A hypothetical VAT group includes a bank among its members. The bank has to buy a computer costing £1 million to run its loan account. The interest from the bank's borrowers is an exempt activity. The bank buys the computer, incurring VAT of £175,000. The hypothetical VAT group cannot claim back the VAT that is has paid because it is to be used for activities that are exempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The avoidance schemes about which we are worried seek to reduce the VAT properly payable in the example that I gave. In one type of avoidance scheme known as the entry scheme, input tax deduction on the computer equipment can be taken by a separately registered associate company outside the group on the basis that that company will sell the computer equipment back to the main group as an ordinary taxable supply. However, before full payment is made for that taxable supply, the associate company outside the group is transferred into the group. That ensures that the bulk of the subsequent payment escapes VAT because, as I have explained, charges within the group do not suffer VAT. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
computer is then available for the group's use, largely tax-free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of joining the same VAT group, the result could be achieved by other means, such as the transfer of the associate company's assets to the group, or by a leasing scheme. Whatever the means, the result is that the group achieves a significant reduction in the VAT that it should bear. Clearly, that result was not intended by the grouping provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example that my right hon. Friend the Minister has given clarifies the problem, but will he confirm that all the cases of artificial VAT avoidance involve companies leaving or joining a group in the artificial way that he has described?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of interest, do many of those schemes involve banks? What has been the loss of revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An entry scheme may not involve the company that is originally outside the group subsequently joining the group. Similarly, the so-called exit schemes may not require a company within the group subsequently to leave the group. All that may be involved in either case is the transfer of the business between one company and another. The clause sometimes appears widely drawn because a discrete corporate entity may not leave of join a group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to single out banks as users of such avoidance schemes; they can be used by financial services companies or groups generally, and I mentioned insurance companies earlier. Such schemes may not even involve exempt supplies at all. A well-known example with which we dealt last year involved an ordinary trading company purchasing cars for business purposes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, knows, VAT is not recoverable for those purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is necessarily widely drawn. Revenue loss can be extremely difficult to quantify, but I can assure my hon. Friend that hundreds of millions of pounds are potentially at risk. I may have an opportunity to quantify the loss more exactly when we debate later amendments. It is clear that avoidance schemes pose a serious threat to the Exchequer and, unless we stem them, they could put the very existence of the group facility in jeopardy. Grouping can constitute an important deregulatory benefit for business. However, in the event of serious abuse of grouping, we may have to follow other countries and refuse to make the option available to British business. I would not welcome that but it is always a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation that we are proposing is the most effective means of tackling unacceptable manipulation of grouping rules while maintaining grouping as an option for British business. The Committee will recall that we introduced an amendment to grouping rules in last year's Finance Bill to counter one particularly damaging scheme which had been upheld by the VAT tribunal. This introduced a specific measure providing, in particular
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
circumstances, for an automatic VAT charge to be imposed on the departure of a company from a group. When introducing that measure, I said that Customs would be reviewing the operation of VAT grouping in more detail. The present measures result from the first phase of that review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause and the related schedule increase the powers available to the commissioners of Customs and Excise for determining the operation of the grouping rules. Customs will now be able to direct that supplies that would otherwise have been disregarded for VAT will be subject to tax. They will also be able to direct retrospectively either that an associated company shall be treated as if it had been part of a group from a particular date, or that a member of a group shall be removed from that group from a particular date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers will enable Customs to thwart avoidance schemes based on the deliberate movement into or out of a group by negating the precise cause of the tax loss. The inherent flexibility of this approach, which is familiar in the context of income tax and capital gains tax, will enable Customs to differentiate between deliberate avoidance and innocent transactions, which a more rigid and automatic response does not readily allow. Nevertheless, we recognise that powers of this sort need to be exercised with care if they are not to disturb genuine commercial arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this reason, we have tried to define the scope of the powers as clearly as possible without reducing their effectiveness. The powers can be used only where there has been a supply within a group. A company must either enter or leave a group, or enter into a transaction, as I explained to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. This is what is called the relevant event. The term transaction is of wide application. It covers not only the transfer of assets of a business as a going concern, but, for example, assignments of individual contractual rights or liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers are further circumscribed. The relevant event must contribute to circumstances that result in input tax deduction being disproportionately greater than the corresponding output VAT. Essentially, the tax benefits of an avoidance scheme must be present. Secondly, even if that is the case, the powers cannot be used if the relevant event producing the tax advantage was undertaken for genuine business reasons unconnected with VAT avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Underpinning those safeguards is the right of appeal to an independent VAT tribunal if a taxpayer believes that customs has got it wrong. The taxpayer can appeal against a direction on the grounds that customs could not reasonably have been satisfied that the conditions necessary for it to be able to exercise its powers obtained. If he fails to satisfy customs on that point, the taxpayer has another chance to demonstrate to the tribunal that there was a genuine commercial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
reason for the relevant event leading to the tax benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a general right of appeal on the issue of how much tax could be recovered by customs following a direction. However, I am alert to the need to protect innocent traders from the possible abuse of discretionary powers. I shall listen carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, who I know is worried about that. Also, I shall respond a little later to the observations on this matter made by the hon. Member for Bristol, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have assured the Committee that the powers may be used only where the relevant event that has produced the tax benefit has been carried through on or after 29 November 1995. I hope that that answers the question about retrospection raised by the hon. Member for Bristol, South. Although completed schemes are immune from action—that is, if a scheme was finished before the announcements made on Budget day—customs can act against schemes initiated but not completed before 29 November 1995. Customs will shortly publish fuller details of how the new powers will be exercised, together with examples of when they will and will not accept that there has been a genuine business reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the greater flexibility provided by these powers means that we can repeal the broader provisions introduced in last year's Finance Act, which have been criticised for being difficult to apply in certain cases and for being a burden on innocent businesses. Comments from the trade show that that will be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
and 78, were designed to explore, thus allowing me to keep my contribution short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 77 and 78 were inspired by the Confederation of British Industry, which has been worried about the impact of clause 27 and of schedule 3. I should point out that I have no declarable interest with the CBI: I am speaking purely because it has convinced me of the justice of its case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also point out that I am well aware of the growing abuses of the VAT system, which the clause and schedule are designed to stop. Those abuses have been growing fast and have, as I understand it, considerable potential in the tax planning industry to grow to a much greater extent than they have already. The attempt of the clause and the schedule to block abuses of the VAT system is welcome and has support. The difficulty, as my hon. Friend pointed out, comes down to the broad nature of the powers that have been given to Customs and Excise under clause 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 77 deals specifically with the powers of the tribunal. It is designed to reverse the present effect of the clause, which puts the onus of proof on the person who is accused of VAT evasion. The amendment would transfer the onus of proof to Customs and Excise. It also highlights the restricted nature of the ability to appeal to the tribunal. I can do little better than to quote the submission of the Chartered Institute of Taxation. It argues that the restrictions are too tight and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a taxpayer wished to argue that a direction given by the Commissioners was out of time or is wrong on the basic facts eg the supply was a conditional sale and not a lease, there seems to be no appeal to the Tribunal on such issues."</p></blockquote>
That seems unreasonable. It would be sensible for the tribunal to have normal appellate jurisdiction, which is common for tribunals in normal circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the consequences of having such a tightly drawn restriction on the tribunal's powers is that it tends to bring the tribunal into disrepute. Someone who makes an appeal to a tribunal might have a perfectly legitimate case which is sustainable in natural justice but which the tribunal is forbidden to consider because of the tight nature of clause 27. The tribunal itself will attempt to bend the rules to assist the appellate and to enable the appeal to succeed even when, under the strict interpretation of the legislation, there should have been no grounds for appeal. In other words, if legislation is drawn this tightly, the system itself will attempt to get round it. Although it may not be desirable to reverse the situation, as my amendment would do, I believe that the tribunal's powers need to be increased and that there should be broader grounds for appeal, if only because of natural justice.

Amendment No. 78 concerns the definition of transaction, about which my hon. Friend the Minister made some helpful comments. Transaction is an extremely general word and can cover anything; indeed, it has been suggested that it could even cover the clearing of a cheque. I am sure that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
Government do not intend Customs and Excise to be so imprecise. I understand from what my hon. Friend said that the Government intend to define more closely what is meant by "transaction", if for no other reason than to ensure that any company that enters into an arrangement for genuine commercial purposes will be able to say whether that arrangement falls within the anti-avoidance provisions of clause 27 and schedule 3. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that genuine business reasons would allow companies to avoid anti-avoidance provisions, but such reasons are rarely clearly defined. A company will enter into many transactions for genuine business reasons, which incidentally reduce its VAT obligations. As my hon. Friend said, many legitimate transactions reduce VAT obligations under present grouping arrangements—he mentioned the £400 million a year that the Customs and Excise will not attack. Under the amendment, however, transactions that are undertaken for genuine commercial reasons could be attacked purely because they reduce a company's VAT obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question of straight judgment as to whether a transaction has commercial, rather than VAT avoidance benefits for a company. A clearer definition of the term "transaction" could be included in the regulations and would be extremely helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned taking the anti-avoidance measures back to 1973, but I shall attempt to catch your eye and address that issue when we debate the schedule, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendments are complex, and the Paymaster General tried to assist the Committee in his opening comments on the previous set of amendments. He said that he would speak on the amendments at the end; he did not rise and we therefore voted on them in the absence of his response. We hope that he will respond in detail to the amendments because otherwise it makes it difficult for the Committee to have proper scrutiny; we do not have the benefit of extensive civil service briefings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is very difficult to hear this morning and I am grateful to whoever turned off the heating, because it was noisy—although we may not be grateful when we get to this afternoon's sitting. It has been difficult to follow some of the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 16, line 20, leave out "either".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take government amendments 7 and 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient if I spoke briefly to the amendment but I also wish to offer something to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham. It would be appropriate to do that in introducing the Government amendments because I wish to signal that we want to take another look at the provisions on appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments were a result of the consultation exercise that we carried out after the budget statement and of our discussions on the subject. They form a group and fall into several general headings. They are partly designed to plug technical deficiencies in the legislation and I am grateful to the outside interests that drew those to our attention. No legislation of such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
complexity is free of technical deficiencies and they should be corrected within the Bill rather than waiting for another Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, we are keenly aware of the need to strike a balance between the legitimate rights of business and those of the taxpayer. Overall, the clause and amendments achieve that. We could not consult on general measures before Budget day because that would invite forestalling and encourage the very schemes that we are hoping to prevent. By exposing draft clauses subsequently, we have been able to respond to some concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should particularly like to deal with the point about appeals eloquently made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham. As the Bill stands, the tribunal can examine only whether Customs and Excise acted reasonably on the facts available at the time that it made a direction. If it was subsequently discovered that the commissioners would have considered other matters had they been drawn to their attention a different conclusion might have been reached. At present, the tribunal is precluded from examining wider matters. As my hon. Friend said, tribunals might be induced to try to extend their powers beyond what is provided in statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a legitimate concern. As additional protection for taxpayers and groups, I should like to consider the matter further with a view to tabling an additional amendment on Report to extend the powers and discretion of the tribunal on appeal so that it can consider these wider matters. I hope that that will satisfy my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Bristol, South who made a similar point and tabled an amendment to pursue the same objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further point to which I must respond relates to the burden of proof, which has been mentioned on both sides of the Committee. Opposition Members have tabled an amendment to change the burden of proof, but we cannot accept it because customs would have to take additional powers to gain the satisfaction that they seek. We all accept that businesses or groups know more about their own schemes than anyone else. Unless undertaking a criminal investigation, customs does not have the necessary power to be satisfied that a scheme is being undertaken for business purposes, not tax avoidance. We are carrying forward what already applies in appeals—that it is up to the taxpayer to satisfy the tribunal that the situation advanced is indeed the case. Changing the burden of proof around would render the provisions, if not ineffective, at least a great deal less effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sums of money being regarded as potentially at risk are very large. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield asked me to try to quantify it. I can tell the Committee that £4 billion of unrecoverable VAT arises—or does not arise—every year in the United Kingdom. All that is not at risk. A good deal of it, however, falls within the group sector and, given the number of determined avoidance schemes available, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
suggest that £600 million could be at risk if we fail to stem these particular avoidance schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Government's intention to reduce the growth of VAT avoidance. No doubt, that is needed. However, the Government should acknowledge that one of the pressures that has created the growth in the avoidance industry is the standard rate of VAT, which has more than doubled while the Conservatives have been in office. Time after time, the conservative party tries to capture headlines by claiming to be a party that reduces taxation, but VAT has increased by more than 100 per cent. while the Conservatives have been in power. Of course, as taxes go up on businesses, businesses devote more effort and spend more money on employing advisers to suggest how they can legally avoid taxation. Surely the best way to cut down on VAT avoidance would be to adopt a strategy similar to that for income tax—to reduce the tax burden. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether the Government have any plans—although not in this Finance Bill—to reduce the overall VAT burden?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the assurances and comments made by the Minister about the clause. However, I think that it is a shame that the clause remains not very well targeted. It is regrettable that it has been drawn up in such a rush that so many amendments are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the principle of group VAT relief. United Kingdom legislation permits corporate bodies under common ownership to register VAT under a single registration. As the Minister remarked, five other European countries adopt a similar provision. I think that that is right and sensible. VAT groupings allow conglomerates and groups which would otherwse have to hold numerous VAT registrations and complete a similar number of returns to form one or more VAT groups. That has major advantages in terms of reduced administration and because transactions between VAT group members do not attract VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally important to recognise that VAT grouping has advantages for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise because, first, it reduces the number of registrations that must be policed and, secondly, greater security arises from the joint and several liability for the VAT debts of the group members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the clause because of the growing number of VAT avoidance schemes being touted about by legal and corporate advisers. A case in point

	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
concerns Thorns Materials Supply Ltd., although there are several other instances where VAT avoidance is apparent. I should be interested to know how the Minister reached his figure of £600 million being potentially at risk as a result of avoidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
