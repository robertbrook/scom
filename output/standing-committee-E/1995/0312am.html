	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to review the current capital gains system in the United Kingdom. Most members of the Committee will be familiar with the American saying, "If it ain't broke, don't mend it". I believe that our system of capital gains tax is broke, it should be changed and there is a consensus for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the two weeks since I tabled my new clause, there has been much debate in the press about capital gains, all of which has been in favour of reform of the tapering system and of a lower capital gains tax. I am also pleased to have received much support from parliamentary colleagues on the Committee and in the House. I am grateful to many organisations that are interested in such matters: the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, the Country Landowners Association, the Engineering Employers Federation, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Adam Smith Institute and Pro Share have all contacted me and support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a growing consensus in Parliament, in business and among investors for reform of the capital gains system. That consensus may even extend to Opposition Members. Things are changing on this front and there is a wider appreciation of the importance of capital having a reasonable tax regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current problems of capital gains taxation stem from the capital gains changes that Nigel Lawson, now Lord Lawson, who made so many worthwhile reforms of our tax system, introduced in 1988. He made a mistake when he increased the rate of capital gains from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. and accepted the argument of the Inland Revenue that capital should be taxed in the same way as income. He was wrong to accept the advice of tax gatherers, who may have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
thought that the changes would make their task easier. The changes have not been good for business, for investors or for the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The yield from capital gains tax since Nigel Lawson introduced those changes in 1988 has fallen quite remarkably. The advice that he received from officials in 1988 when he presented his Budget was that increasing the rate of capital gains tax from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. would produce more revenue. The advice from those officials was over-simplistic and they did not understand that changes in tax lead to changes in people's behaviour. Since the rate was raised to 40 per cent. people have been less willing to realise their investments. Instead of the yield from capital gains tax rising, it has fallen dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1987–88, the last year in which capital gains was at 30 per cent., the total revenue yield amounted to £2.2 billion. The following year, when the so-called reforms were introduced and capital gains went to 40 per cent., revenue fell to £1.8 billion. The next year it fell to £1.7 billion. The year after that it fell to £1 billion and the year after to £900 million. Since then it has stayed below the £1 billion mark. The effect of increasing the rate of capital gains tax has therefore been to cut revenue by some 50 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the increase in the rate from 30 to 40 per cent. has been the main cause of the reduced yield since 1988, why does not my hon. Friend simply propose to reduce it from 40 to 30 per cent.? That would be much simpler than his complex new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and I shall explain the rationale for a tapering system later. If any hon. Member though that the rate should be reduced from 40 to 30 per cent., he would be free to table new clauses and amendments to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fall in revenue is directly attributable to the increased rate. Reliefs for capital gains have been changed since 1988, but no significant increases have been made, apart from venture capital trusts. Their effect is not apparent in my figures, although the Revenue estimates that it will be about £150 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the argument that, since Lord Lawson made the change to which he has referred, there has been significant growth in the number of vehicles that provide a tax shelter for capital and, therefore, the capital gain? One thinks, for example, of the growth of personal equity plans and TESSAS—tax-exempt special savings accounts. That growth goes a long way towards explaining the reduced yield from capital gains tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reliefs to which my hon. Friend referred were in fact introduced before the Lawson reforms and the increase to the 40 per cent. rate. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
rise in the rate has pushed the yields down, and I shall draw on evidence from the United States to support that point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is most generous to give way again. The new clause would reduce the capital gains tax rate by reducing the amount that is liable for tax and, following on from the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman), there would, therefore, be no need for the tax system's current complexity or for other vehicles that reduce the capital gains tax rate. It would be much simpler to have a lower rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) because he has made the point well. Several vehicles add to the capital gains tax system's complexity and often fail to achieve their originators' aims. My system of lower rates would allow people to make what they think are the best investments and to pay a reasonable, rather than an excessive amount of tax on any appreciation on their investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another remarkable aspect of the figures is what has happened to investment in this period. One of the organisations that has supported the new clause is ProShare, which is pressing for wider share ownership, particularly among individuals. It has calculated the amount of uncrystallised capital gains that exist, but which individual investors do not want to realise because of the penal rates of tax that they would have to pay. It has also examined what has happened to the United Kingdom equity market in the past three years. Quoted equities are the largest source of assets for capital gains, and equity markets have grown by 50 per cent. in that time. None the less, yields from capital gains remain low. ProShare has calculated that the total unrealised capital gains in the equity markets in those three years amounts to £62 billion, on which the tax payable would be £14 billion. Individuals would be happy to pay tax on all those investments that have risen in value if there were a more reasonable capital gains tax regime. If we cut capital gains tax and had a tapering system that lowered rates of tax, the total yield to the Exchequer would increase—people who are sitting on gains because they do not want to see 40 per cent. of them taken by the tax man would respond to a more reasonable regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States experience bears out my point that cuts in the rates generate more revenue. Much research has been done on the United States, which has had various tax rates over the years; the cuts in capital gains tax there in 1979 and 1982 resulted in more revenue. Every instance of a capital gains tax cut in the United States has been rapidly followed by a significant increase in capital gains tax realisations and by higher taxes paid on those gains. The lower tax costs of selling assets has increased realisations and tax payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the fact that people do not want to pay the current high rates and so hold on to existing assets, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
rates create several serious economic distortions. First, a bias against risk-taking! entrepreneurs are less likely to invest in risky projects if they believe that high rates of tax will be payable on the gains that they achieve, having risked their capital. Individual managers are less likely to move from a larger, cosier corporate environment to starting their own businesses if they know that they will be paying the same rate of tax on capital gains. So the current system imposes a restriction on entrepreneurs' ability to invest and expand. High taxes on savings, of which this is one, are also unhelpful to our economy, encouraging consumption and bringing down the overall savings ratio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the immediate tax consequences of capital gains tax rate reductions, there are the much more important consequences of the second-round tax revenue effects. If capital gains tax is set at more reasonable levels, more people will want to invest and that is important because it means more businesses, more prosperity and more jobs, which in turn create more revenue. The American experience is again relevant; the United States Joint Committee on Taxation, which reported on the proposed capital gains tax reductions that President Bush advocated, estimated that around $11 billion of revenue would be lost by those changes but that there would be a $100 billion increase in economic activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is praying in aid the United States, a country I know well. Did he note that when it was announced last Friday that 750,000 new jobs have been created in America, the Dow-Jones index took a terrible dive, almost to the point of panic? It seems that there is a contradiction between job creation and the value of shares being held up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) makes an interesting point, but he needs to think carefully about it. I was saying that lower capital gains tax rates encourage people to start businesses, which adds to economic wealth, employment and prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quoted equity markets are somewhat different from the unquoted markets. The hon. Gentleman referred to last Friday's fall in the Dow-Jones index, which is perhaps attributable to the view that the American economy may be overheating. There will be no further interest rate cuts in America, and when there is no prospect of further interest rate cuts in an economy and an expectation that interest rates will rise as part of a cycle, it is not unusual to see quoted investments fall. If the hon. Member for Rotherham examines that phenomenon more closely, he will understand exactly what I am driving at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States has done a tremendous amount of research on capital gains tax rates; one of the leading authorities is Professor Laurence Lindsey of Harvard university. He summed up the matter well when he said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sensitivity to tax rates is probably greater for capital gains than for other kinds of income."</p></blockquote>
Revenue raising for the tax alone is not the best method. The United Kingdom's 40 per cent. rate is clearly not the rate that generates the most income. A lower rate would generate more income, and a lower rate still would generate more economic activity. In the United States, it has been calculated that the optimum rate for capital gains tax to generate the most revenue is around 15 per cent. For it to generate more economic activity, the optimum rate is probably even lower than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the American experience, but members of the Committee will be all too aware that in United Kingdom political circles, the tiger economies of the far east are receiving a lot of attention. In many cases, they do not have any capital gains tax. There is no capital gains tax in Hong Kong, where Governor Patten seems to have broadened his education significantly and changed his views on many United Kingdom political questions. Indeed, the Hong Kong economy is going from strength to strength. If he were here today and saw the support for my new clause from Conservative colleagues, I have no doubt that he would support me and advocate the changes that I am suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that there are great admirers of Singapore on both sides of the Committee. Lee Kuan Yew has said that a nil rate of capital gains tax is a precondition of rapid economic growth. From our experience in the United Kingdom in the past six or seven years and from the experiences that we can see around the world, I would say that a much lower and more reasonable rate of capital gains tax is required to help our economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my hon. Friend's studies on the subject, has he found any major economies with a capital gains tax rate as high as the UK rate of 40 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question. I have not been able to find any tax rate as high as that in the United Kingdom. I understand that ours is one of the highest rates in the world. It is ironic that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will defend that 40 per cent. rate when he speaks later on in the debate. We look forward with interest to what he has to say in defence of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the new clause was about tapering rather than reducing or abolishing capital gains tax. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on the remarks made by the permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Terence Burns? He stated that capital gains tax must be retained to prevent the massive loophole that would allow people to turn income into capital gains. That is a good reason to keep the 40 per cent. band, certainly for short-term holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. If he examines the taxes Acts, he will find that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
Revenue already has a mass of anti-avoidance legislation to cover every capital gains loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we had a nil rate of capital gains tax in this country, the differential between income tax at 40 per cent. and capital gains tax would be lower than the equivalent differential that existed during the 1970s, when Labour was in office. Then, capital gains tax at 30 per cent. compared with a rate of income tax that went as high as 98 per cent. Labour Chancellors at the time made sure that there was a weight of anti-avoidance legislation on the statute book to prevent people from transferring income into capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue has a belt and braces approach to the matter, and the thinking behind Sir Terence Burns' argument is very out of date. For example, the Revenue might consider that people controlling a private company would be in suitable environment for turning income into capital, but such people can already pay a much lower rate of tax simply by taking dividends out of the company. By doing that, they will pay only 15 per cent. extra tax, but if they leave the money in the company, allow the money to work for the company and eventually sell their shares, they will suffer a 40 per cent. rate of tax. The intervention by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) showed up another significant weakness in our present capital gains system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak briefly about the tapering system. The hon. Member for Leith mentioned problems with short-term gains. In proposing a tapering system I am trying to be helpful to the Revenue and to answer the argument that people who make a short-term gains that are similar to income should still pay a reasonable rate of tax. My new clause would provide that the revenue generated when a person realises a capital asset that has been held for less than one year should be treated as income. After that one year, the tapering system would operate. Holding an asset for more than one year shows that the purchaser intended to hold it for a period of time. That person therefore deserves a lower rate of tax than 40 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the proposed tapering system operate over seven years? I think that some Opposition Members will agree that there is a need to provide an incentive for people who invest for the long term. I am thinking especially of people who take risks, start businesses and create wealth and employment while expanding the economy: their long-term commitment to holding and building up investments over a period of, say, seven years entitles them to the full benefit of paying no capital gains tax at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tapering system represents the best of both worlds. It meets the Inland Revenue's worries about short-term gains, but it rewards investors who invest for the longer term. Those are the people—the wealth creators, the risk takers, who set up their own businesses to increase the prosperity of their families and this country—whom the Conservative party should encourage and reward.

I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will welcome my proposed changes because they are beneficial to taxpayers and to the economy, and the Exchequer itself would be better off. The Government have a fine record of advocating tax cuts. In Committee today, we want the Financial Secretary to honour the Government's remit to cut tax and to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) for tabling the new clause. He touched on a wide range of important points. In his opening remarks, he said that the Government's taxation regime has not been good for business in Britain. I have to say, "Hear, hear" to that. The hon. Gentleman animadverted on Labour's tax regime of the 1970s, but it must be remembered that many more people were in work in that period so, presumably, even with the problems and pressures they felt that they faced, businesses had a greater chance of success under a Labour Government. I do not want to return to the 1970s; I do not find this endless going over of old ground particularly helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West drew on examples in other countries. I shall deal briefly with the example of the Asian tigers. Yesterday I received a letter from the Governor of Hong Kong to tell me that he had 500 more days to go. I hope that I am not revealing a confidence because he asked in the letter: "How much longer do you have to go?" I do not know whether that was a personal remark about my fortunes in the next election or his ready understanding that he will return to fight on the Opposition Benches for the leadership role which the Prime Minister has already donated to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be no capital gains tax in Hong Kong, but the Government have one inestimable advantage there: they own all the land in the colony and thus have an extraordinary source of revenue raising which is denied to the Exchequer—unless the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and his supporters are suggesting that all land in Britain should belong to the state. In Hong Kong, 80 per cent. of all houses, homes and flats are built by public authorities. It has one of the strongest public investment led building programmes anywhere in the world. No such suggestion is made in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Singapore, the arguments prayed in aid do not quite add up. To be sure, there is no capital gains tax in Singapore, but the public authorities have an extraordinary alternative source of revenue raising namely, the compulsory 25 per cent. deduction on everybody's income for the central provident fund and the 15 per cent. deduction on all pay rolls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What sort of capital gains tax regime exists in the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I will stay with the chopsticks in my hand for the time being before answering the hon. Gentleman's question.

In Britain, we could wipe out the one third of our tax take that comes to the state to pay for the social security bill if we adopted a Singaporean model. I see no evidence from the Conservative Benches of movement in the Asian direction.

Let us consider Taiwan, a country much in the news at the moment and being threatened by a totalitarian state as we speak. The Hsinchieu industrial park new Taipei is the result of $40 billion public investment by the Taiwanese Government in the past 10 years. That has allowed an extraordinary agglomeration of small, now big, firms to flourish. When we buy computers on the Tottenham Court road, it is mainly their products that we purchase.

I have no evidence anywhere in our country of our Government being willing to invest such sums to back our entrepreneurs and unleash the hidden talent that is held back by lack of investment which could otherwise express itself in flourishing new businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West mentioned the United States. However, let us not forget that virtually all the growth in the United States since 1980 has been due to high deficit spending. President Reagan was the last great Keynesian of the 20th century: he left behind huge public debts and budget deficits for his successors to grapple with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate we had an interesting discussion on flat-rate tax, which also has some intellectual merits. However, there is a contradiction between flat-rate advocates and those who want to balance the budget. I am worried about what new sources of revenue will arise to take the place of those we abolish. We shall hear what the Financial Secretary has to say about that. The price of the American model, we must not forget, it cities in which no one dares to live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood my point. Every time capital gains tax was reduced in the United States—especially in 1979 and 1982—the revenue increased. That was my point. We do not need to talk about where the extra revenue will arise from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to wander into a seminar on the United States economy in the past 15 years. In broad terms, the high level of public income pumped into the economy—principally in the Reagan years through huge arms spending—obviously has an immense spin-on effect for jobs. The extra revenue was provided through the creation of extra jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see some advantages in the arguments made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. I agree with him that the ownership of shares in this country is too narrow. Sid has been well and truly buried. The days of the 1980s, when the Government gave people a 10 bob note and told them to hand it in the next day to get a pound back—the fiddle of privatisation—are long over. We now see institutions clawing back individual shares. I would certainly like
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
to see share ownership extended. I moved a new clause last week in that direction but it did not find favour. I also agree that trading and dealing in shares is far too complicated and expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen when we do X or Y amounts to a theoretical debate about economic consequences—for example, how much revenue will flow in through the abolition of CGT. In many newspapers—the money pages of 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> for instance—there is advice about how to avoid, within the limits of the law, paying unnecessary tax. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington made the good point that we have created a panoply of tax-free investment measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a married couple took out their full allocation of PEPs and TESSAs over 10 years, and assuming that the increases continue as now, they could have something like half a million pounds tax free if they took the revenue in the form of income or capital gains. Those have been useful savings tools, but people have been able to shelter far more of their savings and incomes in such tax-free instruments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that a married couple who invested £18,000 a year for 10 years under PEPs and got a 17.5 per cent. yield on a combination of capital and income would have £1 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am grateful to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. I just wish that I had some of his money to put into a TESSA. He makes an important point. My rough calculation was a yield of between £500,000 and £750,000; his makes it £1 million. I am grateful for that fact: I shall check it and pray it in aid in future discussions about the nature of tax and savings instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask where public revenue will come from. We have certain duties to discharge in Government, in society and as a nation. If we adopted the different tax regimes that have been proposed in probing amendments here, such as a flat tax or capital gains tax exoneration, we would have to ask whether our society will have a sufficient tax base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause contains some interesting ideas on the problem of long-termism. I agreed entirely when the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West justified his tapering concept. Were the Committee to agree to what is a probing new clause and probing amendments to it, I should like the clause to be more narrowly focused on a specific part of the economy that has not done well under the Government: manufacturing. The clause would have two distinct problems. First, it will provide a huge kick-in this summer with a fire sale of shares held for more than five, six or seven years to add immensely to the oft proclaimed feel-good factor that is supposed to arrive as a result of the first generation of TESSAs and PEPs reaching the end of their terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little cynical about that, and smell a political bribe. It is reasonable for the Conservatives to seek to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
influence the electorate, but we should not bounce tax changes into law that would allow people to adjust share buying or shareholding to plan for the longer term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but there is a great weakness in amendment (a). He seeks to delay implementation of the new clause for 12 months, but that would freeze investment in Britain for 12 months. That would be extremely damaging. I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is claiming too much for the new clause. Every hon. Member who tables a new clause believes that it is the one instrument that will change the direction of economic thinking in our country. However, many more instruments, not only those in the Finance Bill, are needed to encourage the entrepreneurship, creation of new businesses and employment of new staff that we all support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from concern about the clear political bribe that is implicit in the new clause, I am also worried by the proposal's extension to property. Property is dear to the Hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. When he was a councillor on Westminster city council, he was expert at arranging property questions. If we reduce our tax revenue by the means that the new clause proposes, who will pay for upgrading social housing that is riddled with asbestos, into which poorer people were decanted in Westminster to gerrymander more votes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to make ad hominem remarks, but the hon. Members who tabled the new clause have many property interests. According to the Register of Members' Interests, the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) has a wide interest in property. He makes no secret of that. He is a director of Raptor Residential Investments plc—a jurassic contribution to the concept of property development. In a property market that is coming off the boil, and declining after the boom of the 1980s, the last activity that we should encourage is more investment in property. Members of Parliament who live outside London receive a handsome allowance of £10,000 a year for renting or buying a property in London or their constituencies as a necessary second home. The last message that we should send to the public is that we are voting ourselves a huge, new, tax-free capital gain if we sell the houses that public moneys allowed us to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every Finance Bill contains a wide range of tax reliefs. We have debated them in the past two months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman's first point about the date of implementation, which would be extremely damaging if it was accepted.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable point, but perhaps I shall not give way again, because the hon.

Standard international definitions of manufacturing are accepted for all standard industrial classification and other statistical purposes.

Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West that that would be difficult—how would he overcome the problem of unit trusts, for example, if only part of their portfolio was invested in manufacturing? It would not be a consistent percentage at any given time. Would some unit trusts be partially exempt from capital gains and others wholly exempt, or would all unit trusts be subject to capital gains?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really want to draw my remarks to a close—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I was about to sit down, but an interesting new hare has been let on to the course. The hon. Member for Fulham asks a fair question; the amendments and the speech on the new clause by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West encourage individual shareholding and a move away from the cumulative mutual or unit trust systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the question posed by the hon. Member for Fulham is that a unit trust that has some holdings in manufacturing industry, some in United Kingdom companies and some in foreign companies, will have the benefit of relief on capital gains tax on its holdings in United Kingdom manufacturing industries.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speechless only at having to listen—I do not want to be insulting—to comments about which the adjective that comes to mind is ignorant. Analysts at any investment institution know exactly how the divisions are arrived at; partly, they are internationally agreed and accepted for different categories of business. The manufacturing sector is clearly defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin) made a fair point about the thrust of my short amendment, which did not contain the arguments that might have placated Conservative Members: it is designed to privilege United Kingdom-based manufacturing. Similar ideas are being developed in the United States to promote firms that will commit themselves to manufacture, trade, develop, research and employment in America. That will be part of a tax regime that, increasingly, we, too, shall have to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the new clause are interesting. I mean that sincerely, despite my remarks about asbestos, Westminster and examples of snouts in the trough, of which we are all too accustomed from some Conservative Members. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West raised some interesting points. My amendments tighten and give clearer direction to his suggestion. The debate will not go away as we move towards a society where far more wealth is held in the form of capital and less is made through employment. We must get this area of taxation right. I do not know whether we shall vote on this but I welcome the tapering idea and the long-term view. It is an issue to which future Finance Committees will have to return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West on moving the new clause. It is particularly necessary because the debate has started on whether capital gains tax is a sensible tax. It raises only about £1 billion: it is a bit of a nonsense to have all this anguish over that when total Government expenditure and income is £300 billion. That is the amount raised from individuals. I accept that a little more is raised from companies. Capital gains is, however, an enormously time-consuming, bureaucratic and unsuccessful tax. It is a tax on savings and on personal responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
One of the biggest worries is that a direct relationship can be established between savings and investment. As a Committee we should look at ways in which we can encourage investment in the United Kingdom economy, particularly by United Kingdom citizens. No distinction is necessary between property and manufacturing. I freely accept that I have declared an interest in a property company in the Register of Members' Interests. The company has only recently been formed. There is no sizeable capital or any capital gains involved in that company. I am not benefiting and could not benefit from new clause 15, and certainly not from the new clauses that I have tabled, which set timetables of 10, 12 or 15 years for people to get tax exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose those timetables because I believe that people who commit to the United Kingdom for that length of time should have some sort of reward. We should also consider not drawing an enormous distinction between the problems of defining manufacturing industry, which, as just been pointed out, is virtually impossible to do. Hanson is an example that has just been given. It not only has manufacturing industries all over the world but has an interest in radio. One would spend an enormous amount of time trying to separate out capital gains in that group into manufacturing capital gains and service industry capital gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anglo-Dutch companies such as Unilever are sometimes involved in manufacturing and sometimes involved in a different business. One could, on a conglomeration basis, have enormous difficulties trying to make what would probably be meaningless distinctions. Also service charges could be raised in the group which would diminish capital gains in the service industry companies and increase it in the manufacturing companies. Such a separation would open up a new avenue of tax avoidance and evasion and would be a complete waste of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that in the modern economy companies now straddle manufacturing and service. However, the annual accounts of Hanson or Tomkins and other conglomerates separate out clearly the individual companies that they own and the profit and loss balance sheets for each company. The idea that everything is too complex and that people cannot work out where the money is coming from and who should or should not be charged is pushing it a bit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say to the hon. Gentleman that a manufacturing company has to buy in services. The quantity of services bought in would be reduced to increase the profitability of the manufacturing company and reduce the profitability of the service side of the business. Companies draw legitimate distinctions in their accounts between various sectors—and often between geographical areas—and it is not beyond the wit of a group of companies to devise methods by which they can avoid capital gains tax in one part of the group and pay it in a part of the group that makes little or no profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help my hon. Friend slightly. The hon. Member for Rotherham does not understand his own amendment. The new clause concerns shareholders in companies. One must make a decision in respect of the company as a whole about whether it should be defined as a United Kingdom manufacturing company. On all the examples set before him, the hon. Member for Rotherham has been able to give the Committee no guidance whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. It was out of kindness that I did not draw that final conclusion on the hon. Member for Rotherham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rotherham has some intellectual pretensions. I believe that he writes books. I cannot understand why, on his criteria, someone with an intellectual property should not be eligible for capital gains tax exemption. I thought that the Labour party wanted to encourage education—that is what it talks about. If people create an intellectual property of some value, such as computer software, why should not they get capital gains tax exemption? Why should the exemption be restricted to manufacturing industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should give incentives in this country to the output from education—the rewards from the education system—but the Labour party talks perpetually about putting more inputs in education rather than concentrating on whether we are getting the outputs that we want. We want our citizens to be better capable of producing competitive value in the international marketplace. We can do that only if we have rewards for intellectual output from education rather than concentrating solely on the inputs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should also consider a basic anomaly about capital gains tax. Foreign investors do not pay capital gains tax in the United Kingdom. It is a tax on United Kingdom resident companies and on United Kingdom residents who stay here and commit themselves to the United Kingdom for a long time. It acts as an incentive for anyone who has a potential capital gain or thinks that he might develop something that would produce a capital gain to go abroad. There is a mobile international marketplace for capital, manufacturing and business, so the more we retain capital gains tax, the more we will encourage people to take their business ventures abroad and to minimise the profit on the business ventures that they have in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have recently been in contact with a number of inventors and innovators who have produced interesting inventions in this country. I went to the inventions fair at the Barbican at the end of last week. There were more than 150 British inventions on display, and American investors were looking at them to consider what potential they might have in other countries. There is a grave danger that many of those interventions will not end up being developed in this country. If we want to encourage inventiveness we should seriously question the way in which capital gains tax operates as a tax on successful British
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
residents and exempts those who invest here from abroad. The international competitiveness angle is extremely important.

Most European countries either do not have a long-term capital gains tax, or, if they do, the rate is much lower. France does not always get my highest approval ratings, but it has a capital gains tax of only 19.4 per cent. with an exemption from that tax of £50,000 of proceeds. Germany's capital gains tax rate is, at 26.5 per cent., half that of the income tax rate, with exemptions in many circumstances. In Italy, the rate is some 25 per cent. of the gain on unquoted investments, but that can also be reduced considerably. In the United States, the maximum capital gains tax rate is 28 per cent., and there are many tax shelters for people who create businesses. In Japan, the maximum rate is 26 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend respond to the questions that I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West? I agree with my hon. Friend that the rate in the United Kingdom is too high, but why does not the new clause propose a simple reduction in the rate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to see my hon. Friend support a new clause that proposed a reduction in the rate. However, there is merit in the argument that people who have committed to the United Kingdom economy should some time be rewarded with a reduction not just to 20 per cent. but to zero. That is why I am focusing on the proposition that the tax would be exempted if a holding were retained for 10, 12 or 15 years. I support the new clause, but I acknowledge that it is possible that it would incur a significant cost in the short term, while the system adapted and before the additional revenue arose from the abolition of capital gains tax. Therefore I have proposed, if a tapering system over five to seven years is not possible, that capital gains tax should stop after, say, 15 years. That echoes the Prime Minister's statement that we should seek to abolish capital gains tax in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that all hon. Members question the basis of the Inland Revenue's calculations, and that the abolition of capital gains tax could increase overall tax revenues, especially in corporation tax and income tax. My hon. Friend the Minister may deem that the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West would be on the expensive side, but my proposal is that we at least make a start. Let us have the starting period at 10, 12 or 15 years—at a point where people would be rewarded for a commitment to the United Kingdom economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate should not be politically charged. It is depressing to think that our debates on this subject are politically charged, whereas those in the United States are not. One of my friends in Washington DC runs the American Council for Capital Formation, a lobbying organisation financed by private investors, accounting

	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
firms, businesses, fund managers and others, with a budget of $1 million. It lobbies to reduce capital gains tax, and succeeded in getting a lower rate a little while ago. It is supported by both Republicans and Democrats. Its work enjoys cross-party support, and its success can be judged by its $1 million lobbying budget. Many people in the United States feel it worthwhile to continue to try to reduce the impact of capital gains tax on successful American companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clauses would reward people who show a long-term commitment to the United Kingdom and to our economy. I have described the problems with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rotherham. He might say that Conservative Members would benefit, but he ought to examine some of the declarations of interest made by Labour Members. There is no doubt that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) would benefit considerably from the effect of the amendment on manufacturing industry—possibly by as much as £10 million, £20 million or even £30 million.

The real issue is that we live in an age that is increasingly dominated by high technology—all hon. Members recognise that. We need to consider where the jobs of the future will come from: high-risk, high-reward businesses. When a high-risk business fails, there will be no capital gains. In such cases, the business men will have difficulty starting up again if they have lost a lot of money. When high-reward businesses succeed, we want to encourage their business men to reinvest. Although there are some special reliefs for reinvestment, they do not go far enough and do not encourage all the people who might gain from an initial successful business to reinvest. We must encourage intellectual value in the United Kingdom economy. Although manufacturing is important, we need to promote the added value—which is often higher than manufacturing can provide—of intellectual achievement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my hon. Friend's remarks. Does he agree that it is a particular problem for an individual who has made an investment and built up a successful company to face 40 per cent. capital gains tax? That may deter him from going to the stock market and obtaining the finance that he needs to expand his company. The penalties are so high that he may decide to hang around for retirement relief. The current system of reliefs is not good enough for us to achieve a really successful economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. One hears about a number of anomalies when one has the privilege of meeting successful entrepreneurs. Since I became a Member of Parliament, I have met many more such individuals. Capital gains tax is an enormous disincentive. The reason that is given for having capital gains tax is the need to tax—heavily—the many people who sit on their backsides doing nothing but investing in shares and equities. In my view, the vast majority of capital gains tax comes from successful people who invest in successful businesses and operations, as well as from some long-term savers. We want to encourage those people as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one carried out proper research in this country, one would discover that capital gains tax actually attacks the very people whom the Government want to help. Will the Minister consider seriously an in-depth, long-term study into capital gains tax? We do not have the benefit of people such as my friend in Washington, who runs the American Council for Capital Formation. That body has carried out many studies of capital gains tax in America, and it is a tragedy that more is not known about it in this country. Studies in the United Kingdom have been limited in detail and insufficient information has been published by the Inland Revenue as to how capital gains tax operates and whether it hits people who sit on property for long periods or people who create value and wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with an example from the United States of a successful business called Netscape, of which many people have heard. It makes the software that enables one to look at the world wide web on the Internet. The company has been in existence for only two or three years, but it has gone from a valuation of nought to $2 billion in that short time and has created a number of jobs. More importantly, its software has created jobs not only in Netscape, but outside it, because it has led to a much faster development of the Internet than would otherwise have been possible. It has created jobs in the United Kingdom and other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting aspect of Netscape is that the person with the intellectual property obviously had no money to invest and had to be supported by someone else. The person who founded the company with the big bucks was a university professor who had made his $50 million fortune in a previous company. Capital gains tax fails because it taxes such success and prevents people from investing it in the next company. The university professor made his first $50 million in one company and now has $500 million—just think of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
jobs that he could create if he put some of that gain into another company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should encourage people to make capital gains one, two, three and four times in their lifetime. In the United Kingdom economy, however, a successful entrepreneur usually faces a massive struggle to make one big gain in his lifetime. The whole tax system is designed to slow up entrepreneurs and good job and wealth creation. We want faster job and wealth creation in the economy, and the long-term solution is to abolish capital gains tax at 10, 12 or 15 years—or even at seven years, as my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West suggested. I should like to think that it is a short-term solution, which the Government might adopt to create more wealth, value, business and jobs in the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Their case against capital gains tax is unarguable, and their case for tapering and abolition over time is impossible to refute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I proceed, the Committee should know that I am the unpaid parliamentary adviser to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds and have declared that position in the Register of Members' Interests. My comments might not meet with tremendous approval from the association, however, for reasons to which I shall come shortly and particularly because capital gains tax produces a competitive advantage for unit trusts and investment funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem with capital gains tax it is a tax on savings. Because it taxes savings and particularly because it is does so at the same rate as income tax, it makes people indifferent about whether they save or consume; indeed, it encourages people to consume when they ought to be encouraged to save. It is one of the great tragedies of our economy that our savings ratio is too low. We must fundamentally object to a capital gains tax regime that positively discourages savings and encourages people's natural tendency towards momentary gratification through consumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the only savers who would be deterred would be those who could save more than £750 a month? One can put £9,000 a year into a PEP, which accumulates without income tax of capital gains tax. How many savers could save more than £750 a month?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point, and I shall come to PEPs and TESSAs shortly. My hon. Friend is right: the structuring of the capital gains tax system and all its exemptions are an attempt to address the fundamental problem with CGT. We create CGT, then say that such distortions in the decision of the investor between consumption and saving have been created that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
becomes necessary to create other vehicles to redress the balance in favour of savings. We end up, as my hon. Friend said, with a system that produces vehicles to enable people to avoid paying capital gains. Such complexity is wholly undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not discussing the abolition of capital gains tax as such in the new clauses. Rather, we are talking about the tapering system leading up to eventual abolition. The tapering system is a means of reducing the capital gains tax rate in years after the first year. Reducing the amount of capital gains subject to tax has the effect of reducing the capital gains rate. The new clause proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-west suggests a tapering of the capital gains tax rate over seven years, which is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause tackles Lord Lawson's reason for raising the capital gains tax rate from 30 to 40 per cent.—straightforward anti-avoidance. I recall sitting in the Committee considering the Finance Bill when Lord Lawson introduced that change. His argument was largely based on anti-avoidance problems. He saw an opportunity for individuals to switch income from an income tax into a capital gains tax regime. The only way in which Lord Lawson could envisage avoiding that was to have marginal tax rates of both at the same rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether Lord Lawson was right then. I suspected at the time and still suspect that he was not. I agree rather with my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West that anti-avoidance provisions that were already built into the system to avoid switching from income tax to capital gains tax worked quite effectively in most instances. Nevertheless Lord Lawson, presumably on advice from the Inland Revenue, believed that that was not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Lawson's argument is a reason for keeping capital gains tax at 40 per cent. for the first year. No individual would want to go through the expense of converting income into capital gain if the delay built into the system outweighs the marginal advantage in the tax rate. So the anti-avoidance argument strongly supports the new clause's proposal for tapering. It is the first stage towards the eventual abolition of capital gains tax and it is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. One of the major problems of the capital gains tax system is how it works in practice. Presently an individual investor has an option either to invest in listed equity securities or to put his money into one of a number of different schemes such as PEPs and TESSAs that will avoid capital gains tax. An individual investor also has the choice of purchasing unit trusts which, in their own dealings in equities, are exempt from capital gains on their own transactions. The capital gains tax liability for the investor occurs when he sells out of his unit trust—when he cashes in his money at the period of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
the disinvestment. Effectively, the capital gains tax system means that the individual investor is discouraged from taking his own investment decisions. He will deal with institutional vehicles such as PEPs, TESSAs or unit trusts. In other words, he will employ a professional manager to manage his equities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that some PEP structures can be self-managed, but that is rather an expensive method and most TESSAs and PEPs are institutionally managed, as indeed are unit trusts. The pernicious effect on unit trusts is that people are discouraged from trading out of one unit trust and into another. Once they have got into a unit trust, they will tend to be stuck in it because the consequences of selling out of it is to incur capital gains tax liability. Therefore, an underperforming unit trust has no pressure to raise its performance from its existing investors, although it has pressure from people who are investing in it for the first time. People already in it will incur a capital gains tax liability on trading out of the unit trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My strong belief is that distortion by the capital gains tax system of the personal investment market into the institutional investment market has serious consequences for people in corporate governance. One of the great tragedies in Britain is that individual investors have been driven into the institutional investment market by a combination of the tax system and the preference of large corporations not to have a great many small investors. The new CREST clearing system on the stock exchange has the same effect. The result is that individual investors will no longer be voting shareholders in the companies in which they invest and will no longer have any real or potential say in how the companies in which they invest operate either on ethical or salary grounds or on the basis of whether they are performing well in their industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the liquidity in the stock market is also reduced. Consequently, liquidity lies essentially with institutional decisions: investment decisions and liquidity decisions are taken by institutions rather than by individuals. The liquidity flows in the market are thereby reduced which means that the pressures on underperforming companies are largely brought by institutions rather than by individual investors, which is highly undesirable. That tendency might be unavoidable, but the tax system ought not to encourage it as the capital gains tax system does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons—because of complexity, the fact that the capital gains tax is a tax on the wrong types of earnings and the distorting effects that it has on the investment markets—I urge a move towards abolishing capital gains tax. The new clause, so ably tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, is a first stage along that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any tax should ideally be fair and simple, have a broad base and be cheap to collect. Capital gains tax meets none of those criteria: it is not fair for reasons already outlined; it certainly is not simple, but is very complex when one takes indexation into account; it has no broad base—in fact, it has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
narrow base and a high rate, whereas I favour taxes with a broad base and a low rate; and it is very expensive to collect. I consider it to be a thoroughly unsatisfactory tax and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West on having raised the subject. However, I cannot agree with his approach. There is no doubt that capital gains tax distorts economic behaviour because one can to some extent choose when one pays it—or whether to pay it at all. The new clause would introduce a huge new complexity into the system because pooling would no longer operate and people would have to keep records of each purchase and sale so that they knew which year of the proposed seven years the sale subsequently fell into. Apart from that complexity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend would accept that investors have at the moment to keep records to calculate the indexation. My new clause would simplify matters because after seven years there would no longer be a capital gain and individuals would no longer have to keep detailed records, so that rebasing—going back to 1982 and getting values on value assets—would go by the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One has only to look at my hon. Friend's new clause to see how complex it is; at the moment, we have two rates of capital gains tax, but he wants seven rates. I do not favour having endless rates of one tax; I would prefer a broadly based tax with a low rate instead of the current narrow base with a high rate. However, far more important than the complexity of the new clause is the fact that it would bring in further distortions in economic behaviour because people would have a major incentive for holding on to their assets for as long as possible to minimise their gains. Most taxable gains have been made over a long period, so the effect of abolishing capital gains tax after seven years would be to reduce the yield by more than half at one go. One of my hon. Friends said that £1 billion is not much, but I think that £1,000 million is rather a lot of revenue. Indeed, last week I was castigated for suggesting a relatively minor change to the taxation of the film industry that would cost £15 million a year for three years, when it would terminate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend accepts because he was also trained as an accountant, that materiality is usually 5, 10, 15 or 20 per cent. and that £1 billion in relation to £300 billion is not an enormous sum of money. If that £1 billion prevents 20 or 30 businesses a year form starting up and gaining investment, we are losing income tax that might be more than the £1 billion raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject is important, but I do not believe that capital gains tax prevents 20 or 30 businesses a year from starting up. Apart from anything else, the venture capital industry has been extremely successful over the past 15 years; that is where most of the cash for growth businesses has come from and those funds do not pay any capital gains tax. I acknowledge that for any entrepreneur
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
thinking about setting up a business the possibility that he may, if he is successful, have to pay capital gains tax at some stage must be some disincentive. I am sorry that some successful business men move offshore—although they cannot take their businesses with them. A constituent of mine who set up a successful business that was floated on the stock exchange in 1992 is now a wealthy man and moving to the Bahamas so that he does not have to pay capital gains tax—but his business, which employs hundreds of people, operates in the United Kingdom and he cannot take it to the Bahamas with him. So one should exaggerate that aspect of the issue. The proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Dover would create even more of a distortion than that of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West; instead of a slope, he proposes that for 10, 12 or 15 years the rate should be 40 per cent., after which there would suddenly be a precipice when no tax is payable. That would create an even greater incentive for people to hang on to their assets until the end of the relevant period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend describes a situation in which someone says that he is leaving the United Kingdom and going to the Bahamas to avoid a pernicious tax of 40 per cent. Would not it have been better if that business man had not had to pay the tax and had stayed in my hon. Friend's constituency—or, better still, my constituency—creating some jobs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that the business man set the business up and created hundreds of jobs. He was not deterred by the existence of capital gains tax.

I am not trying to defend the status quo. I believe that capital gains tax should, in due course, be abolished. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West spent 22 minutes telling the Committee why the rate is too high before he got around to the point about tapering. I agree that the rate is too high and that the rise in the rate in 1988 depressed the yield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>Surely it would be more sensible simply to reduce the rate to 30 per cent., or 20 per cent., or whatever level would maximise the yield. In due course the tax could be abolished. However, we should not deal with the matter in the way proposed in the new clauses. That would be unfair and cause even more economic distortions than at present. Moreover, I imagine that the proposals would be expensive. Their cost has not be discussed, but no one can argue that yield will rise if a person suddenly does not have to pay capital gains tax after seven years. There will be no yield after seven years, nor would there be any yield after 10, 12 or 15 years, if the new clauses tabled my hon. Friend the Member for Dover were accepted. Therefore the proposals must be expensive.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
	<p>There are other priorities apart from reducing or abolishing capital gains tax, but, when the time is right, we must proceed in the way that I have suggested—by reducing the rate. That approach is much simpler than what my hon. Friends have suggested.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. We approach the end of an interesting and constructive debate. I join with my hon. Friends in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. The hon. Member for Rotherham insisted on pronouncing the name of my hon. Friend's constituency in accordance with the pronunciation of the name of a defunct and discredited economist. The hon. Gentleman should not visit that town if he carries on doing that, he should stick to the proper pronunciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with what my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said about complexity. He describes a system in which rich people can avoid paying tax by going abroad, but in which the poor old middle classes get clobbered and trapped because they are not rich enough or mobile enough to avoid paying tax by setting up offshore trusts or going to live in the Bahamas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital gains tax is absurd and ridiculous. I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and of the Prime Minister that it should be abolished eventually. The new clause reflects a degree of consensus on the matter. That consensus was clear among the CBI and the other organisations that my hon. Friend mentioned. It has even found an echo on the Labour Front Bench, and the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) has spoken about the desirability of a tapered capital gains tax system. I wait with baited breath to hear what the shadow spokesman for Her Majesty's official Opposition—which is quite a title—has to say about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absurd speech from the hon. Member for Rotherham showed that he was probably not responsible for drafting the amendments tabled in his name. I hope that we may look forward to something more intelligent than that speech, as there appears to be a consensus that the heavy taxation of long-term capital gains is a bad thing that needs to be remedied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noticed that no hon. Member on the Opposition Front Bench appear to intend to speak in the debate? [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall deal with avoidance. We are told that Sir Terence Burns and the Inland Revenue are worried that people might avoid income tax by converting their income into capital gains. Sir Terence Burns is wrong about that, just as he was wrong about the ERM. A wealth of legislation allows for careful discrimination between income and capital gains. We gave powers to the courts to enable them to see through transactions to their intentions. If a transaction is structured to convert an income into a capital gain, the courts can rule that that is not allowed because the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
transaction intends to avoid income tax. Other countries, such as Singapore, Japan, Germany and Switzerland, where a big differential exists between capital gains and income, do not get hung up about the problem. They do not fear that individuals will try to deceive their equivalent of the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West was right when he claimed that capital gains tax changes people's behaviour. It has even changed the Government's behaviour. The most blatant way in which the Government are trying to ameliorate the damaging effects of the rate of capital gains tax, and to find money for small businesses, is through venture capital trusts. We had a debate about venture capital trusts, in which we heard that they were too complicated. The entrepreneurs to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield referred will take their businesses elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my constituents has made one fortune in Britain and wants to make more. He has gone to California because he does not want to be bothered with the ridiculous capital gains tax. In California, he will be able to invest his money freely and benefit from the growth of the businesses that he has helped to finance. He has got the Inland Revenue out of his hair, but we have lost him and the benefit to our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want to establish a framework for higher growth than we have hitherto enjoyed in the post-war period, we must examine the absurdity of capital gains tax. The entrepreneurs who create wealth want the tax out of their hair. I have great sympathy with the new clause. I hope that the Financial Secretary will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few points although I do not want to prolong the eager anticipation of the hon. Member for Colchester, North of the speech of my hon. Friend for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), or delay the Financial Secretary's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not very impressed with new clause 15, or our amendments, which are steering rather than probing amendments. The debate has focused on whether capital gains tax rates should be cut or whether a broad tapering mechanism, such as that which the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West proposes, should be established. The steering objective of our amendments is to draw attention to a third proposal, which is to examine a series of focused exemptions to provide incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support Conservative Members' comments about the need to provide incentives for people to start up in business. I also support greater incentives for people to keep their money in small businesses. At present, the capital gains tax system does not do that, and it should change. Yesterday, the Prime Minister spoke of the need to provide more help for small businesses, which the Government should actively consider. The Opposition are very interested in doing something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 15 and the other proposals relating to 10, 12 and 15-year exemptions have too broad a brush.
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
I want a system of CGT exemptions focussed on unquoted companies, although I appreciate that not all wealth is created by the manufacturing sector. The new clause would support wealthy investors in quoted equities which, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said, is the largest market. Such widely based incentives would be of little benefit to the taxpayer. The hon. Member for Colchester, North said that rich people can go abroad, but the middle classes get clobbered; however, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield rightly said, only those who can afford to save more than £750 a month are likely to be liable to CGT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to see the benefit to the Exchequer in providing an incentive for people to invest in unit trust tracker funds, in which there has been a growth in the past 12 months. Those funds invest and track the FTSE 100—the biggest companies in the United Kingdom. They are designed to be long-term vehicles for investment, and I do not understand why individuals who are already wealthy should benefit from the greater tax break of not having to pay capital gains tax on unit trusts that invest in tracker funds in large, stable companies. I would prefer a series of focussed exemptions, such as venture capital trusts, which I support. Something specific should be done in respect of unquoted companies—my theme throughout the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strangely, I find myself agreeing with the very valid comment by the hon. Member for Dover about the need for a study of capital gains tax and its effects. There should be an overall review of CGT, focusing on how the system can be redesigned to provide greater support and impetus to small businesses, rather than comfort and assistance to investors who are already extremely wealthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Conservative Members pleaded for cross-party agreement on the issue, and there is some consensus on the importance of stimulating investment and enterprise. It is clear from the debate that there is a case for a review of capital gains taxation, but it is equally clear that the new clauses are not the right way forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West said, the proposals are too wide and indiscriminate and would cost too much. I agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that £1 billion is a lot of money for his hon. Friends to toss around as if it were neither here nor there.

Those considerations must be thoroughly examined. On that matter, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West that the hon. Member for Dover was right to say that there was a good case for a considered and measured study of the review of capital gains tax, to shed more light on the arguments advanced this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are seeing today is the shameless manoeuvring of the Labour Front Bench spokesmen, who are posing as capital-friendly when they know that even if they formed the next Government and introduced proposals to reduce or ameliorate the current damaging rates of capital gains tax, they would be frustrated by the lumpen Luddites on their Back Benches, who still pursue the politics of envy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Colchester, North and for Milton Keynes, South-West were not in the Committee Room when I started my remarks, and therefore missed what I said about Labour's position. The tone of the hon. Gentleman's comments says something about how sincere were the invocations of cross-party consensus and the talk about the need for broader public agreement on the need for reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made our position clear. There is a case for examining how capital gains taxation operates. We are keen to stimulate enterprise and new investment. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
worth examining what a tapered or two-tiered system might have to offer. We approach the matter with intelligent and serious interest, and we want to be informed by the evidence. There is no point in hiding our objections to the new clause. As has been pointed out, even by Conservative Members, there are questions involving cost, complexity and avoidance. We need to examine the subject seriously before running the risk of adding to compliance costs, and possibly of giving perverse incentives and opening up opportunities for the avoidance of industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West made a number of claims about the comparisons between the position in the United Kingdom and that in other countries. One fact not often mentioned in the debate was that we have indexation, which many other countries do not. That makes a considerable difference. I am advised that in the United States the federal rate on gains is now the same as that on income. When the rates were equalised in the late 1980s the United States' revenues from capital gains increased. The current United States pressure to reduce the rate of United States tax on gains largely reflects the fact that that country does not have indexation. The current overall rates in the United States, taking account of rates at federal, state and city level, are broadly comparable with those in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some confusion during the debate between new investment and what is essentially transfer of assets. I do not say that the health of the market in terms of the exchange of assets is not also an important consideration, but it is not the same as the new net investment with a productive return to companies or to the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusion of the debate ought to be that capital gains tax needs examining to see what more can be done to stimulate investment and enterprise. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West made a particularly strong point about unquoted companies. But it is equally clear that the new clause would be costly and complex, and would lead to a growth in avoidance activity. It therefore should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a lengthy but important and informative debate on capital gains tax. It is clear from the contributions of my hon. Friends that though we may disagree about the path that we should take towards the ultimate objective of abolishing capital gains tax, we are committed to the removal of that tax. That remains the Government's long-term objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a moment ago from the hon. Member for Oxford, East—he, at least, had caught a whiff of spring in the air—about the need to look again at capital gains tax. That is perhaps a shift in the Opposition's position from their line just before the Budget, when they attempted to rubbish any kind of claim made in public to change, abolish or modify capital gains tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that there is an important difference between proposals sensibly to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
reform capital gains tax, which we support, and abolition, which we oppose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but we have had a fairly thin diet in respect of what reform the Opposition think should take place. As in all matters, one judges the degree of reform against one's commitment to change. Without doubt, Conservative Members have put a lot of thought into the matter, as demonstrated by the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West for a taper, and by the alternative view, centred on a lower rate, proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to examine the arguments carefully and to treat them with the seriousness that they deserve, and I want to give the Committee some further information about the proposals that form the centre of our discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield put his finger on the turning point of the arguments before us. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West advocated a route towards changing capital gains tax—and its ultimate removal—by the creation of a taper system whereby the rate reduces over a seven-year period to a nil rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative—and simpler—proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield was that, when the Government can afford to do so, we should move in stages towards a lower rate of capital gains tax, thus avoiding many of the complex practical difficulties of introducing a taper system to what I think Committee members of all parties agree is already a complicated tax. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said, it is an expensive tax to collect. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield also touched on that point. That is the turning point of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members understand and are comfortable and at ease with the workings of the free market and a free enterprise system, and we all agree that we need to promote investment and encourage a flexible capital market, free of distortion. That came out strongly in the first 22 minutes of the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. Getting rid of distortions in the capital market is something that we all agree with, but my hon. Friend's proposal to move towards that virtuous position by a complicated set of stages, introducing a taper system, would effectively leave in place for five years the very distortions that currently cause problems with capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to my hon. Friend that his proposal is a somewhat un-Conservative way of looking at the world. Ideally, we all want the removal of capital gains tax so that capital markets can operate freely and without distortion. Any formulation of a tapering nature adds a distortion for precisely the reasons expressed by those who have gone down an alternative route. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover advocated a taper at 10, 12 or 15 years as a simple approach. In my notes I christened that the "white
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
cliffs" approach—one is either on the top of on the bottom, but there ain't no choice on the way down. Any such activity would inevitably create a distortion in the capital investment decisions of some people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Financial Secretary for giving way, because it is important to be clear about his future policy intentions on capital gains tax and on distortion effects. Why does he favour reducing rates of capital gains tax, when that is likely to increase distortions by changing the equalisation of marginal rates between income tax and capital gains tax? Why does he want to go down that route as a policy prescription, rather than increasing thresholds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come on to that in the later arguments that I want to deploy before the Committee. We start from a position very different from that of the hon. Gentleman. We stated unequivocally that we wanted to remove capital gains tax. Our task is to get from where we are to where we want to be, and there are several choices before us. Some of my hon. Friends advocated taper arrangements, but I believe that those would distort individual investment decisions because people would have one eye on the taper and one eye on the investment opportunity. That is not the best way to ensure that full and proper investment decisions are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has been somewhat critical of the taper approach; he described the attitude of my hon. Friend the Member for Dover as the "white cliffs" approach. What comments would he make about the German system of dealing with capital gains, which is similar to that advocated by me and by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover? The Germans tax short-term capital gains at one rate, and ensure that long-term capital gains are free of tax. All members of the Committee are aware of Germany's economic successes, and especially of how medium-sized companies have been built up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not discuss the German system in detail, because I am here to discuss our policies and to explain how we are trying to remove capital gains tax. However, in advocating change to one tax, one should not see that change in isolation from the total tax situation. My hon. Friend might recall that earlier in our proceedings, I mentioned the 1993 OECD survey on the burden of tax as a proportion of GDP. The United Kingdom came second only to Portugal in that survey, with the rest of the developed world—certainly the rest of Europe—trailing behind. With respect, my hon. Friend must consider the totality of the tax system because any investment decision, especially in the business sense, will take into account not just capital gains tax but other taxation costs. Ultimately what counts is the rate of return on investment projects in the United Kingdom. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover advocated the need to attract entrepreneurs to the United Kingdom, and for United Kingdom residents to make such investments. Ultimately, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
rate of return, which is a composite of all those factors, is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend comment specifically on my initial point that a lower rate of capital gains tax helps the economy to grow overall? I referred to America, where research showed that Reagan's capital gains tax cuts caused a ninefold increase in gross domestic product. Does my hon. Friend accept that such relationships exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there may be such relationships. We need to study the issue very carefully. I was anxious to learn what work had been done. I wonder whether my hon. Friend could comment on a recent study by Burman and Randolph in the "American Economic Review", 1994, which casts doubt on some of the findings that he has put forward. Has he had a chance to study that research?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is discussing studies, will he embrace the suggestion of the hon. Member for Dover, which enjoys a measure of cross-party support, to initiate a proper study of the options for a reform of capital gains tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a responsible Government, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we maintain a constant review of the operation of all taxes. It would be irresponsible to do otherwise. I commend the hon. Gentleman to a little study of his own: he might care to examine the Inland Revenue statistics, which give a clear picture of the impact of capital gains tax on an annual basis. Once he has studied those, he might be able to share our rejoicing in our long-term objective to get rid of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss some of the implications of the proposals made by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West because, in fairness, we must treat them seriously. I understand that my hon. Friend has an army of supporters for his proposals, and I am not surprised. Any group of people faced with an opportunity to implement a change that it deems beneficial is bound to sign up and say yes. Although I take my hon. Friend and his supporters seriously, I want to suggest to them what some of the implications of their proposals may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where do I start in that analysis? I start from the position that when the Chancellor casts his Budget, sets out his public spending programme and identifies the public expenditure survey's constituent elements in the Red Book, he predicates his plans on there being revenues from capital gains tax in current circumstances. We should therefore ask what the revenue implications of relieving potential gains of that tax would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said that the taper system would quickly realise gains for people who have held their assets for five to six, six to seven and, indeed, for more than
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
seven years. He said that there would then be a one-off increase in tax. If that were the case, however, there would still be a revenue shortage. The Government estimate—estimates will always differ—is that the total cost of new clause 15 would be £1 billion in the financial year 1997–98 and £1.7 billion the next year. By the turn of the century it would be £2.2 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those arguments, naturally, are predicated on an improving economy in which gains would increase. My hon. Friend shakes his head, and I am quite prepared to consider alternative studies and arguments. Those are the facts, however, and I have to work with the information that I am given. That is the best advise that I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. What are the assumptions behind those figures? What account have my hon. Friend's officials taken of behavioural changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stored-up gains are currently available to tax, but the assumption behind the figures is that they would not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to finish because I need to give some information to my hon. Friend the Member for Dover. But perhaps I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Did he say that most of the tax would be lost because people would realise capital gains that they would not otherwise have realised, in order to benefit from the reduced tax structure? Is not he comparing a situation in which capital gains are in store, pending a time in the long-distant future when they might be realised and subject to a 40 per cent. tax rate, with one in which people realise them in the present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to deal with my hon. Friend's point. The direct cost of the taper, which I have given, takes into account not behavioural effects, but the current pattern of disposals and the tax revenue losses. There would be such losses, and we would have to address that problem. Under the new clause, we would have to find a way to make up for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make progress. We would have to make up lost revenues of the magnitude to which I referred. For the sake of completeness, I shall add that the first-year cost of new clause 41 would be £850 million, the 12-year cut-off for new clause 42 would cost £750 million, and new clause 43 would cost £650 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind my hon. Friend that the proposals that the then Member for Blaby and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Lawson, introduced to reduce the top rate of income tax were premised on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
the belief that they would reduce revenue. But that did not happen. Instead we raised substantial extra revenue from those taxpayers because we changed the behaviour of the economy, which increased the tax revenue from the top 5 per cent. The top 5 per cent. of income tax payers now pay a higher proportion of the income tax take than before. Does not my hon. Friend recognise that the Inland Revenue and the Treasury are pathologically incapable of making proper assessments when they make adjustments to tax rates? His figures are totally irrelevant to the Committee's thinking on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to my hon. Friend—I must wipe the blood from my elbow—he has not listened carefully enough to what I said. The proposal has a tax cost. Before, gains would have been taxable. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor, in framing the Budget, included those revenues in his forward projections. There is no disagreement about the fact that there will be a loss of tax revenue in the first instance. Behavioural effects may well affect the future, but I cannot comment on that—especially regarding economic activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, but I want to deal properly with the point raised by my hon. Fiend the Member for Colchester, North, who rubbished the best advice that I was given. I must tell him straightforwardly that I have been advised that there will be a tax loss of the magnitude that I indicated. That issue must be addressed before the proposal can be evaluated. Real knock-on consequences will result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give my hon. Friend an example. The cost of the increased personal allowances that have been introduced amounts to some £700 million. I could mention many other potential trade-offs, so my hon. Friend would have to make up his mind—as would my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor, who would receive the same advice as I have received—about the costing of his overall programme. This particular proposal cannot be viewed in splendid isolation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Is he aware that the Treasury has recently been criticised for overestimating Government revenues? Is it not irresponsible to make arbitrary assumptions about changes in economic behaviour and increased revenues? Is it not inevitable that the Treasury and the Revenue adopt a conservative approach to estimating the cost of major changes in the tax system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. We would have been derelict in our duty if we had not taken such information into account. I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Dover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to my hon. Friend what amounts to shocking information? Around a half or a third of the revenue from capital gains tax comes from people who have made a major commitment to the United Kingdom by investing their money for 15 or more years. Those people who have backed this country are then hit hard by a 40 per cent. tax at the end of that 15-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also suggest to my hon. Friend that his figures are rubbish anyway. If the money is spent, VAT is payable at the rate of 17.5 per cent., so £250 million of the £650 million would return to the Exchequer anyway. If the money is saved, income tax is payable on the yield from the investments. Over a period, the Exchequer would recover much of the money. My hon. Friend asks about someone buying a country house, but he forgets the question of who built the house. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Dover, I believe that the promptings, stage right, answered the questions very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me summarise for everyone's benefit the argument about the financial impact of the taper. The direct cost of the taper, before the behavioural effects, of the proposal are considered, would be about 90 per cent. of current yield. I do not believe that it would be possible for the yield from the remaining 10 per cent. to increase by more than tenfold. In fact, the net cost, after the behavioural effect, is reduced to around 85 per cent. of the current yield. I start from the position of an assumed yield from the taxation of capital gains as the system is currently constructed. If we are seriously to address whether the tapered proposal is a runner or not, we must consider the impact on the Chancellor's future financial planning. That argument has not been sustained by my hon. Friends so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend provide a little more clarity on that important point? The Red Book for the 1996–97 financial year shows that the expected yield from capital gains tax is £900 million. Could he set the figures that he is trying to give to members of the Committee in that context? Could he also address what I said about officials being wrong when they advised Lord Lawson that if he went to a 40 per cent. tax rate he would get more tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was advice given to Lord Lawson and not to me. I will tell my hon. Friend the precise situation. The projected yield from capital gains tax on the non-corporate side is £1 billion for 1996–97, £1.3 billion for 1997–98, £1.65 billion for 1998–99 and £2 billion for 1999–2000. For corporation tax on gains, the projected figures are £300 million for 1996–97, £475 million for 1997–98, £700 million for 1998–99 and £875 million for 1999–2000.

	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
Nobody who debates the issue seriously can escape the fact that we start from the proposition that the Chancellor has an expectation of tax revenue from those taxes on gains. We must consider the effect of the taper, which is intended to relieve tax on those gains in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and his colleagues have suggested. I have given a clear indication of the substantial reduction in tax revenue that we estimate would result. Until I receive solid evidence to the contrary, we must use that estimate as a basis. My hon. Friends must think seriously about the totality of options available to change any future tax policy that may be in the mind of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the Committee on the historical point about Lord Lawson, because I worked for him at the time. The advice that he received did not argue that by aligning capital gains tax with the higher rate of income tax that he proposed to introduce in the Budget, he would increase revenue. Rather, the more important tax avoidance point was made: were he tempted, as I think he was at one stage, to introduce a capital gains tax rate that was substantially lower than the higher rate of income tax, it would lead to an obvious and predictable loss of revenue. To that extent, he was concerned to protect the revenue in the first year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his help on that point. He speaks from a unique base of knowledge and involvement in these matters because of his association with Lord Lawson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West noted that capital gains tax receipts have fallen. The method of computing capital gains tax has changed since 1988 and only gains since 1982 are charged. The reduction in yield may also have something to do with the reduction in value of the property market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing that my hon. Friend's speech lacked was an acknowledgement that the Government have already started to dismantle capital gains tax. That is an indication of our wish ultimately to see that tax removed. To that extent, we talked about the enterprise investment scheme, venture capital trusts, reinvestment relief, the extension of retirement relief and other changes. We want to make progress with the reform and ultimate removal of capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made a telling point about the uptake of personal equity plans: there are 6.5 million such plans covering £22 billion worth of investment. Those plans take the ordinary investor away from capital gains tax. That is a significant dismantling of the tax as it applies to individuals and we should take pride in that achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be the practical effects of the taper? We have heard little about the way in which the proposal
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
would be introduced. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield referred to pooling and the consequences of that. For all disposals under such a taper proposal it would be necessary to identify the date that an asset was required. The current rules for shares would have to be unravelled and rewritten, because currently all shares of the same class, date and cost of acquisition are included in the same pooling arrangement. That is to the advantage of those who have such assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Institutions that are considering this matter—perhaps not the supporters club of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West—say that they may not be able to cope with such complexity and would not relish such a change. Other knock-on effects would have to be examined, especially on the totality of the present reliefs, but I shall not dwell on that in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about the United States. The hon. Member for Oxford, East gave us some interesting information. The effective rate in the United Kingdom is 20 per cent. What I find compelling about the tax system in the United States, which has no indexation or exceptions, is that the effective rate is at a higher level: gains are charged at 40 per cent. if assets are sold early, and if they are sold after the first year the rate is capped at 28 per cent. Even at 28 per cent., the rate in America compares favourably with the 20 per cent. rate in the United Kingdom. So we have an advantage in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been challenged from both sides of the Committee to say how we propose to make progress towards our ultimate objective. I understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and his supporters have pressed hard for the Government to take up his proposition of a taper. I hope that I have made it clear to him that, because of its nature and complexity, a taper would be inconsistent with our objective of a distortion-free capital market in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with three options, one of which is the simple option of changing the rate of capital gains tax. The second option involves the individual level of allowances. We are familiar with both those matters. The third options is to consider other ways in which assets could be relieved of capital gains tax. I referred to the progress that we have made in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenge that we must face is that we cannot get from where we are now to where we want to be without considerable cost. We must make progress on the basis of what we can afford to do when we can afford to do it. My hon. Friend cannot escape that issue. He may disagree about the level of cost, but he must agree about the loss of tax revenue on the basis of the plans of my right hon and learned Friend the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the Government's longterm objective is to remain four square behind the view that we want ultimately to abolish capital gains tax. My right hon. and learned Friend is considering carefully the options that I have outlined. In making

his judgment on how to deploy future resources in any Budget, he will have to consider many calls, including calls for public spending alongside any reforms he wants to make to tax.

When my hon. Friends judge this matter they should consider whether they want to go down a route that would continue to lock capital in with the tapers that have been suggested. Plainly, my hon. Friend the Member for Dover would lock in capital for 10, 12 or 15 years; only at various points would his new rate of capital gains tax come in. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West wants to lock it in for five years. Neither proposal meets our long-term objective, which is a distortion-free investment market. I hope that I have illustrated that there are complexities in the matter and substantial costs. We are committed in the long-term to removing capital gains tax altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the good intentions of my hon. Friend the Minister. He set out several options with excellent intentions but, from his argument, I fear that those intentions will not be realised. His argument that considerable costs would be involved in reforming capital gains is not valid. In other countries where reform has taken place and rates have been reduced extra revenue has been generated. My hon. Friend did not address that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accused members of the Committee who seek in various ways to reform capital gains—and there is certainly no shortage of ideas on that—of locking in capital gains. At the start of the debate, I referred to £14 billion of capital gains tax on shares alone that has been locked in by the current system. That shows how flawed was the advice given to Lord Lawson in 1988 when he increased the rate of capital

gains tax to 40 per cent. If hon. Members consult the Red Book issued then, they will find that the Inland Revenue advised the then Chancellor that more revenue would be generated from capital gains by that change. The reality has been the reverse; revenue has fallen against the background of an extremely buoyant equity market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The property market has been mentioned. Most members of the Committee know that most properties in the United Kingdom are free of capital gains tax. Principal private residences, in which there has been a fall in value in recent years, are free of capital gains tax. The Inland Revenue's own figures show that revenue has fallen significantly against buoyant increases in asset value. Too many people will not change their current configurations of investment because they know that they will have to pay tax at 40 per cent. Unless we change that we will not benefit the United Kingdom economy.

The Chancellor would have more revenue, not less, from such a change, and would have more revenue for public services and to reduce taxes in other areas. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dover said when he spoke so ably, our problem is that this tax is a tax on success. To free people to be more successful and generate more revenue must be the message given by the Committee.

My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield referred to a constituent who has fled to the Bahamas. We do not want successful business men to go to the Bahamas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
