<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Before we get engrossed in the excitement of today's business, I wish to raise a matter that arises from what we have already dealt with in Committee. A document from Conservative central office has come into my hands. It is about tax rates on classic cars and is a collaborative venture between Conservative central office and the Paymaster General. It is the first time in my political career that I have been targeted by Conservative central office. Whether it is a peak or a pinnacle, I wish to savour the moment. I want to raise a point of order about the inaccuracies contained in this document—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for the Chair. We must proceed with today's business.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CHARGE AND RATES OF INCOME TAX FOR 1996–97</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 42, line 30, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4) In respect of reclaims by charities of basic rate income tax deducted from Charitable Covenants entered into before 28th November 1995, such income tax repayments to charities shall be calculated with reference to a deemed basic rate of income tax of 25 per cent.'.</p></blockquote>
This is a simple but important amendment and I hope that the Government will accept it or at least give it serious attention. Over the past few years the Government have pursued a policy that was once presented as a tax-cutting strategy. But it can no longer be presented as that because taxes have increased. It has been a tax-switching strategy—cutting tax on income and increasing indirect taxes, especially VAT.<br><br>
Arguments about the impact of the tax burden may divide the Committee, but there has been a side effect which it may not have been the Government's intention to produce. I am talking about the impact of the tax changes on charities. Members of the Committee will be aware that a significant part of the income for charities derives from covenants signed by people to pay a certain amount of money over a number of years on which the charities can recover the tax that the covenator would have paid out of gross income.<br><br>
A specific example may help the Committee. When a charity receives income under a deed of covenant for £75, it can reclaim £25 from the Inland Revenue. That £25 represents tax at the basic rate prior to this Budget
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
of 25 per cent. on that part of the covenator's gross income of £100 out of which the £75 covenant has been paid. I trust that the Committee is with me thus far.<br><br>
As a result of the reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 25p to 24p, a charity receiving a covenant income of £75 will be able to reclaim only £23.68 from the Revenue. For every £100 donation by covenant to charity there will be a reduction of 5.25 per cent. in total benefit. That equals a drop of about £260 on a charity's annual receipts of £5,000. There is some uncertainty about the total cost to charities. An early estimate put the figure of £17 million, but that has been revised to a more accurate £10 million to £12 million. That is not a huge amount of money to the Government, but it is a significant source of income to charities.<br><br>
When I mentioned on Second Reading that I intended to table this amendment, I got what I thought—and hoped—was an encouraging nod from the Minister. I was not alone in thinking that that was the Minister's response: some people sitting in the Gallery thought so too. <i>The Observer reported</i>:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hope of a concession came last week as Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill which would cut charities' losses.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The Minister nodded when Bruce proposed that the Government allow charitable covenants signed before the Budget should continue to qualify for relief at the old rate of 25 per cent. He said he would 'listen hard' to this proposal.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Members of Parliament, charities and tax reform groups have interpreted this as a sign that the Government may consider helping charities recoup losses incurred after the 1p tax cut."</p></blockquote>
As the Committee will recall, I tried to intervene on the Minister in his winding-up speech, but he would not give way. I wait in eager anticipation for his response to this constructive proposal.<br><br>
If the Minister thinks that the cost of the concession might be a little high, I would point out that the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) successfully tabled amendment on the Floor of the House to increase the concession on share option schemes from £20,000 to £30,000. This amendment would cost slightly less than that. It will be an interesting test for the Government. Are they prepared to put share option schemes ahead of a concession that would benefit charities? What value might be put on resistance to this amendment?<br><br>
The effect on individual charities will vary according to circumstances. I have a letter from the National Trust, which is keen that the amendment is accepted. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Trust notes the statutory provision in Clause 64 for a reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 25p to 24p in the pound, which is in line with the Government's long term strategy of reaching the 20p basic rate of taxation.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>However, this does have serious implications for charities who gain a significant portion of their operating income by reclaiming the basic rate of income tax deducted from charitable covenants. The Trust greatly values this additional income derived from its covenanted membership subscriptions which is allocated to conversation work on the Trust's properties. We are already having to reschedule and prioritise essential maintenance and restoration work on the Trust's properties due to a reduction in grant aid."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
Perhaps I should declare an interest as a member of the National Trust for Scotland, but there is support on both sides of the House for the work of that body and of the National Trust representing England and Wales. I am sure that Conservative Members will be especially worried that stately homes and important properties in the care of the National Trust may suffer damage as a direct result of the change proposed in the Bill and of the National Trust's inability to keep up the maintenance programme for properties. The letter continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the 1996–97 financial year…the Trust will lose income in the region of £360,000."</p></blockquote>
My amendment does not address that problem, but that extract shows what the charities have lost while this process has been going on and what they will lose if it continues. The Trust's letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Should a 20p basic rate of tax be achieved, in line with Government's long-term strategy, the Trust would suffer a permanent reduction in annual income of £1.8 million."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, this matter is of legitimate concern to the charities that are affected.<br><br>
In campaigning or representational terms, charities are more concerned about the impact of the switch to VAT. The amendment does not deal with that, but to put it in context and show why this is a small gesture to charities compared with a large shift to their disadvantage, it is now estimated that non-recoverable VAT—for non-business, purely charitable activities—is running at about £350 million a year. One does not have to be a mathematical genius to calculate the difference between 17 per cent. and 8 per cent., which was the rate of VAT when the Government began this shift.<br><br>
In the past couple of years the impact of the lottery has been mixed. Charities get some benefit from it, but that does not compensate them for their losses due to additional taxation. Moreover, charities have to compete with the lottery in the fundraising process.<br><br>
The amendment would do one simple thing, so the Government could and should accept it. All it seeks to do is to allow those covenants that were signed and in place before the Budget to continue to receive tax relief at the rate of 25p in the pound as opposed to 24p in the pound. Charities are becoming more professional. When promoting covenants, they make the tax implications clear to potential covenators. When people write covenants, they make their donations on the basis of what they calculate the charity will receive. When selling the idea to potential givers, charities say, "If you want us to have this amount, you can sign a covenant for that much less and the tax relief will give us the net benefit." Many people make out their covenants to achieve the net effect for the charity that they want to support.<br><br>
I shall round off my argument by referring to the impact of the change as calculated by a few other charities. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which initially estimated that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
reduction would cost £17 million in lost revenue, on the basis of further research has now concluded that, although it is difficult to be precise, the relevant figure—I am sure that that is the figure that matters to the Government—would be between £5 million and £10 million. So it is at the low end of the scale compared with the share option proposal of the hon. Member for Dover, and I am sure that the Government will want to be at least as generous.<br><br>
Oxfam calculates that the loss of revenue per annum would be £150,000. Other members of the Committee may be more familiar with what Oxfam does with its money, but we all know that £150,000 goes an awfully long way in an organisation like Oxfam, which has low overheads and a good record on the delivery of essential services.<br><br>
The Royal National Institute for the Blind estimates a loss of £35,000, the National Trust a loss of £360,000 and no doubt others are paging us with details of their expected losses. The Cancer relief Macmillan Fund, which is highly valued in my constituency, expects to lose about £25,000. The amount varies from charity to charity, but there could be significant impacts on important charities, the work of which I am sure all members of the Committee value—the Government in particular recognise that they do important work.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
We should not take issue with the Government's basic tax strategy—that is a political view and we can argue about it. I am sure that the Government accept that their tax strategy was introduced without serious consideration of the charities and I do not really blame them for that. However, they must accept that it has had and continues to have a significant effect and that the amendment has considerable merit, especially as it arrives at the end of the first year in which the full impact of the national lottery has been felt.<br><br>
In those circumstances, I hope that the nods and encouraging noises that I picked up from the Minister on Second Reading and which people in the Strangers Gallery and the Press Gallery detected, are an indication that the Government recognise the force of the argument and that they want to show the same generosity to charities that they have already shown to people who adopt share option schemes at slightly less cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the comments by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr Bruce). I have been told to watch my language in the past, but not my body language. I realise that sitting in the Chamber during discussions on the Finance Bill is a bit like being at an auction—twitching at the wrong time might land a person with a large bid. If the hon. Gentleman recalls, just before he rose to speak, Opposition Members invited Ministers to listen. My body language, when I nodded in his direction, was to make it absolutely clear that I was listening to him. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
was a courtesy of attention and I think that the hon. Gentleman has rather over-read, as have other observers, what I was trying to say.<br><br>
I noted the merits of the hon. Gentleman's argument, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate them. We must consider the matter in terms of the help that the Government currently give to charities. In the financial year 1994–95, tax relief for charities totalled about £1.5 billion, so I do not think that the needs of charities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the broad thrust of the Finance Bill towards charities? There are several issues in the Bill which affect charities. Will charities be net gainers or losers under the Finance Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised that point Charities have the potential to gain substantially from the Budget, which aims at long-term prosperity and seeks to leave people with more of their money to do with as they want. By definition, that means that people will potentially have more disposable income after they have met their tax and other responsibilities to spend on charitable donations if they want.<br><br>
I thought that the hon. Member for Gordon was being a little adventurous in speaking to his amendment. I noted from a publication from a Mr Gareth Roberts who, I understand, used to advise the Liberal Democrats on tax, that he chastised them for being a high-tax party. The amendment refers to charitable giving, but it has been tabled by a party that advocates a high-tax strategy which, by definition, would leave people with less money in their pockets to give to charities if they wanted.<br><br>
In his analysis, the hon. Gentleman described accurately the effect on those with current covenants of the change in the basic rate of tax, which is the subject of clause 64. The matter can immediately be sorted out by individual givers if they so wish, simply by changing the covenant. Such givers will no doubt be aware of the issue, because the charities will have let them know that there is a problem and will have asked them to do something about it. I appreciate, however, that it may not be possible for supporters of some charities to change their covenants, nor will they necessarily have received the available information. But the fact that clause 64 refers in substantive terms to putting more money back into people's pockets should be good news for charities. They will realise that the matter can be sorted out in the way that I have described.<br><br>
There are other solutions to the problem. We are increasing the allowance for what people can donate through payroll giving, which is the subject of a later clause, from £900 to £1,200 a year. I am sure that the hon. Member for Gordon will know that that way of giving money to charities is not affected by the tax effect, as he described it, on those who want to give by covenant.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the specific point, what calculation have the Minister and his officials done as to the net benefit to charities of increasing the limit from £900 to £1,200? Will the gain be more or less than the loss resulting from clause 64?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It greatly depends on what individuals do. We have merely presented the opportunity. However, I do not want to trespass on the debate on clause 100, when that matter will be more fully discussed. The combination of reduced personal taxation and the opportunity for more payroll giving should be to the benefit of charities; I very much hope so. But there is another method by which charities can, if they so wish, divert fundraising activities to avoid the problem that the hon. Member for Gordon raised.<br><br>
We must see the issue in the context of charities' funding sources. They raise by straightforward giving by individuals, without any tax-beneficial effects, some £800 million. The clause would therefore not affect the totality of their income. Covenanted donations account for some £250 million in tax relief. That puts the matter in context. It is a problem, but one with an immediate solution. Gift aid is a growing area for charitable help, for which tax relief amounts to some £125 million. Therefore, because those who have covenants can do something about it, the amendment is unnecessary.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gordon mentioned the National Trust, whose representation many hon. and right hon. Members on the Committee will have received. In 1989, the Government legislated to ignore the benefit of free admission to properties that are maintained by such charities when they decided whether the 25 per cent. test was met. Thus, the National Trust and similar charities are already given privilege compared with other charities. They ask people to make a covenant, which effectively pays for their subscriptions; that is why the National Trust is affected. If such charities sought to raise money by another method, they could insulate themselves from that effect.<br><br>
The logical conclusion of the system is that if there were no tax, there would be no relief. It would then be a straightforward question of how much people were prepared to give to a charity from their pockets. I understand the point by the hon. Member for Gordon, but I hope that I have shown members of the Committee other ways of fundraising for charities that will insulate them from this effect. With the reductions in tax which I hope the Committee will ultimately confirm to the House, there is an opportunity for people to increase their giving to charities to overcome any of those problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disappointed that the Minister chose to use Japanese body language. Perhaps I should remind members of the Committee that it is polite always to say yes in Japan. When somebody asks a question, one always answers yes, even if one means no, in order not to offend. Of course, when people find out that one means no, they are just as—if not more—offended. The Minister says
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
that his body language was misinterpreted. I remind him that it was misinterpreted not only by me. Perhaps he should give way in his winding-up speech to secure clarification.<br><br>
I was disappointed to hear the arguments that the Minister used to resist the amendment. The Minister knows perfectly well that it is not a simple matter to encourage people to change a covenant. People have been persuaded to sign up and make a donation. They are unlikely to change it spontaneously; it is already in the bag. Moreover, there will be serious administrative costs in writing to everybody concerned. The loss on £100 is £1.32, so it is worth bothering to write only with respect to the largest donations. It is unrealistic for the Minister to suggest that charities can or will write to other than the largest.<br><br>
The Minister spoke about the £1.5 billion of tax relief that charities receive. That is true, but that relief is built into the calculation. Charities are worried that the balance of relief and benefit is shifting against them. They have found that the consistent reduction of income tax balanced by a substantial increase in VAT has had a serious effect on their ability to raise funds in competition with other forms of giving and the national lottery.<br><br>
It is estimated that non-recoverable VAT in 1994 amounted to between £222 million and £334 million—about twice the amount that the national lottery charities board is likely to receive over the same period. The collective benefit gained by charities from the lottery is only half what is lost through additional VAT. Moreover, the system works on a variable basis: some charities gain nothing, others proportionately more or less. In those circumstances, the Government have shown a lack of concern for the serious impact of the simple change in taxation.<br><br>
The £900 payroll giving may increase to £1,200; the Minister is unable to estimate what it will be worth. In any case, it will mean new administrative and promotional costs to charities in order to compensate for money that they thought they possessed but which has been taken away from them. It is entirely legitimate for charities to regard three-year, five-year or lifetime covenants as predictable money in the bag: yet that money has been clawed back.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for Dover moved on the Floor of the House his amendment to increase relief on share options from £20,000 to £30,000, I was surprised that the Government accepted it so readily. The right level is debatable, but the beneficiaries of share option schemes are much less deserving or needing of that sort of money than charities. The Government are relaxed about an extra £10 million of tax concessions going in that quarter, but they are not relaxed enough to allow a sum estimated between £5 million and £10 million to be returned to charities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
Liberal Democrats do not support the £30,000 limit on share options and that they would prefer it to have remained at £20,000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put it the other way round. Presented with a choice of raising the share option scheme from £20,000 to £30,000 or the Government accepting my amendment on charities, there is no doubt that the Liberal Democrats would choose the charity option. We did not oppose the hon. Gentleman's amendment on share options but it was not presented as an either/or option. The Government took the view that it was acceptable for an extra £10 million of tax relief that had not been calculated for in the Budget to go on share options but not to charities.<br><br>
We are all getting used to and will continue to enjoy the attempts of Conservative Members to use the inhouse briefing of Gareth Roberts, but he does not advise the party on tax. I am the Liberal Democrat spokesman on that. Gareth Roberts said exactly what the Minister claimed—that we will be accused by Conservatives of being a high-tax party. So be it: we do not accept that we are a high-tax party, but we are committed to putting extra money into education and we are prepared to say where that money will come from. Any party that does not have the honesty to say that can have no shred of integrity.<br><br>
I do not want to repeat debates that are relevant elsewhere, but the Government claim to have put money into education when they have allowed local authorities only to spend money—they have not provided them with the money to fund that spending.</span></p>

I have much sympathy for the problems faced by charities, but there is a strong case for arguing that charities' business plans will be based on tax expected as a result of covenant payments in the 1995–96 financial year. Similar sums will have been allowed for in future years, Although that may not have been prudent, given that the Government stated in the Budget that they intend to reduce income tax.<br><br>
I should have a great deal of sympathy for an amendment that was narrowly focused and which gave an exception in the 1995–96 financial year. However, we must accept that charities operate in a market place and that that market place changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an intervention, It take it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Please keep it short then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Gordon feel that the amendment is defective in that it does not apply only to one financial year? Would not it find more sympathy if it were limited in that way?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the amendment is defective. However, if Labour Members thought that what the hon. Gentleman suggests was the right way to go about the matter, they could have tabled their own amendment. They chose not to, and I incline to the view that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) has issued a strict instruction to the effect that labour Members should not put their names to anything that might cost even three ha'pence because it will be used against the party.<br><br>
There are times when decisions must be made, and when specific proposals must be advanced. The amendment is reasonable. The amounts involved are easy to calculate. It would help charities and merits support. I do not deny for a minute that charities have to go out and redeploy and resell their packages to encourage giving, nor do I deny that the Government are helping charities in other ways. However, the Committee knows perfectly well the charities are finding the going difficult as a direct result of the competition from the national lottery, the lack of a feelgood factor in the economy, and the combined effect of the increase in VAT and the reduction in income tax.<br><br>
The amendment would elicit a gesture from the Government to show their readiness to respond in a simple and constructive way. If the Government had said that, although they could not accept the thrust of this amendment, they were willing to table another amendment—it might have been limited to one year or contained some other concession that recognised that charities were losing out as a nett result of the Bill—I would have been prepared to withdraw my amendment. However, what the Minister has said so far has revealed no evidence of that. Someone needs to put down a marker to show that he understands that charities being squeezed as a result of Government strategy are entitled to some relief.</span></p>

<p><i>Question Accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have already made clear our attitude to the clause and the 1p tax cut. When people have been hit as hard as they have been by the Conservative party's broken general election promises—22 tax increases since the 1992 general
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
election—we will not stand in the way when the Government, under enormous pressure from the public and from us, find that they must return a little of what they have taken away. But the Government are giving back is just a little and the public have not been distracted from the terrible Tory tax record by the measures in the Budget. In the minds of the public, it remains very much the 7p up, 1p down Budget.<br><br>
People know that the clause is not the product of Government success any more than the rest of the Bill is but the product of Government failure and fear. Ordinary families in Britain are still more than £600 a year worse off because of the impact of tax changes since the 1992 general election when the Prime Minister promised tax cuts year on year. In place of those tax cuts, people have faced 22 Tory tax increases. There has been a record of giving with one hand and taking with the other, and a good deal more has been taken than has been given.<br><br>
When we examine the record on living standards, which the clause effects, we can see the take with one hand approach at full throttle. When it suited their propaganda purposes, the Conservatives were fond of quoting the taxes and prices index that was introduced in 1979, I think. I seem to remember the noble Lords Howe and Lawson arguing that it ought to displace other measures. We have heard a little less about the taxes and prices index from Conservative Members in recent years. I wonder why. Is it because it shows up the Government's record very badly? If we apply that index to deflating last year's average earnings, we find the worst fall in living standards for 14 years. No wonder the feel-good factor is so elusive. As a consequence of Conservative economic failure and the extra charges that are being piled on, people not only feel worse off: they have become worse off.<br><br>
Alongside the 1p in the pound tax cut, people are faced with a plethora of other charges. They include the council tax increases, which even the Chief Secretary to the Treasury admitted to the Select Committee would average 8 per cent., and which the Secretary of State for the Environment, in response to parliamentary questions, calculated would mean an average extra £40 on the council tax. On top of that a raft of other charges is hitting people's living standards and eating away at the value of the 1p in the pound tax cut.<br><br>
Just last week there was an increase in prescription charges, which went up by 25p to £5.50—another hidden tax rise, and a tax on the sick at that. Prescription charges are now at 10 times the level in real terms—even allowing for inflation—that they were in 1979.<br><br>
Members of the Committee have already heard about the increase of £5 in vehicle excise duty. There is also to be a petrol duty increase, which will cost a typical family more than £75; an increase in the cost of a television licence; an increase in tube and rail fares, which will cost an average family an extra £48; an increase in bus and coach fares and an increase in water bills, as well as more increases on dental charges and school meals. The list goes on and on.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
Allowing for the pattern of a typical family's expenditure in the family expenditure survey, such increases mean that more than £230 extra charges will be introduced this year alongside the 1p in the pound cut in income tax. Those charges will be double that amount for those who need to take extra mortgage protection insurance as a consequence of the cuts in housing help for the unemployed which the Government have forced through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When all those charges are added up, they reveal the lowest inflation for 40 years, which means that the Government are on target to meet their inflation target of 2.5 per cent. by the middle of next year. Why does not Labour have an inflation target, if it claims to be so concerned about price increases? Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what target his party would set for inflation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have made it very clear how determined we are to have low inflation in this country. The hon. Gentleman's point will not be welcomed by families who have faced those 22 tax increases in breach of all the Conservative promises that were made at the last general election and who saw their living standards fall in the next year. Whether the hon. Gentleman calls it an inflationary increase in charges or not, it is extra money that people have to pay out of their wages, their savings or their benefits. The Government are hitting people hard. Opposition Members wonder where the elusive feel-good factor is because of the Government's broken tax promises, because of their economic failure and because of people's fall in living standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend focused on the impact on families but he did not mentioned the airport tax, which was raised last year. I have four children, and it added £60—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given the Opposition spokesman great leeway on this. We are discussing income tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The benefits, such as they are, of the 1p in the pound cut in income tax have been largely eaten up—in many cases more than eaten up—by the increase in charges and the fall in living standards that people have suffered. All those people are bound to ask why they are suffering in that way. Why, according to the House of Commons Library, will a typical family now pay—under the impact of clause 64, Mr. Hill—35.4 per cent. of their gross income to the Exchequer in total taxation, whereas they paid 32.2 per cent. in 1979? So as a share of income, the average family pays more in taxation—those are House of Commons Library figures, not mine.<br><br>
People will want an explanation also as to why the Red Book shows that total taxes and national insurance as a share of national income are higher, at 35¾ per
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
cent. for the forthcoming year compared with 34¼ per cent. in 1978–79, than when the Conservatives came to office. Moreover, they are set to rise year-on-year from now through into the millenium. Whey is it, when Conservative Members promise tax cuts every year, that people find that they are paying more in tax after 16 years of Conservative Government, in terms of a share both of their income and of the national income?<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Taxes are higher under the Conservatives. Conservative Members cannot escape their responsibility for that, and neither can they escape the electoral consequences. The Conservative party has become the party of high taxation because it is the party of economic failure, which imposes on people all the costs of keeping more than 2 million people unemployed. It is the party that has achieved a non-oil growth record averaging just 1.7 per cent. since 1979. It is the party that has left Britain with the lowest share of world trade this century, and which has left Britain down at 21st in the world league of levels of investment. As a consequence, Britain has fallen from 13th to 18th in the world prosperity league.<br><br>
After all those broken promises on tax, we are clear that we shall not oppose the 1p tax cut that the Conservative Government have offered. The little bit that is being given back is the very least that Conservative Members can do. They cannot and should not pretend that that is any substitute for the investment, training and welfare-to-work policies that the country needs. The country also needs the dedication to a strong economy and a fair society that it will only get with Labour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is rather odd to hear Labour Members refer solely to the tax burden while conveniently forgetting about the debt burden. When Labour left office in 1979, it left this country with what may be regarded as a not enormously high—although still significant—tax burden as a proportion of gross domestic product. But people forget that the country was borrowing a massive amount as well because not enough was being raised through taxation to balance the books. Today's public sector borrowing requirement of about 4 per cent. of GDP is falling rapidly and is forecast to reach zero, yet when Labour left office, the figure amounted to some 8 per cent. of GDP and we were in serious difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should look at the figures that I asked the Library to find for me. When Labour left office in 1978–79, the PSBR was at about 5.4 per cent. of GDP. Last year, under the Conservatives, it was 6.2 per cent. The previous year it was 7.9 per cent. The year before that it was 7.3 per cent., excluding privatisation receipts. During the period of the last Labour Government, the PSBR averaged £8.2 billion a year. The average for the 17 years of Conservative Government, excluding privatisation, receipts, was £16.3 billion a year—almost twice as high as under the last Labour Government.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not need to waste Library assistants' time to find those figures, which are available on page 87 of the Red Book. The same source shows that, in the year before Labour left office, the PSBR was 3.5 per cent. of GDP. By the time that Labour left office, it had shot up by 2 per cent. of GDP to 5.5 per cent. When the Conservative Government came into office they were faced with a crisis of a rapidly increasing PSBR as a proportion of GDP. It was difficult and it took a number of years to stabilise, but the Conservative Government got to grips with the situation. Under Margaret Thatcher, we ended up repaying debt for the first time that I can recall—probably for the first time this century or the previous century; certainly for many a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago before my intervention, the hon. Gentleman claimed that the proportion of GDP that represented the PSBR when the previous Labour Government left office was 8 per cent. That is what the hon. Gentleman told the Committee. I intervened to tell him that it was 5.4 per cent., which he accepted. I am not surprised because the Library's figures are compiled by independent researchers. The amount of money borrowed under the Conservative Government has been twice as high each year throughout their period of office than it was under the previous Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I said 8 per cent., I was referring to an annualised basis. Obviously, when the Labour Government left office, there was only a short period for calculating the PSBR: the accounting year starts in April and the Labour party left office in June. The fact remains that the PSBR was rapidly increasing on a full annual basis from 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. Not enough revenue was taken in to balance the books. There was a real danger of getting into a serious deficit. The figures clearly show that under a Labour Government, the peak was 9.5 per cent. of GDP. Even during the worst part of the recession of 1993–94, under the Conservative Government public finances hit only 7 per cent. of GDP and it is now rapidly falling.<br><br>
General government expenditure as a proportion of GDP was 44 per cent. when Labour was last in office. It rose to 47 per cent. before the Conservative Government brought it under control. It has subsequently gone down from 47¼ per cent. to 42½ per cent. today. It is scheduled to fall to 37¾ per cent. which is consistent with the Chancellor of the Exchequers intention to get it below 40 per cent. and the Prime Minister's long-term desire to get it down to 35 per cent.<br><br>
I want to introduce the concept of the flat-rate tax rather than have a massive debate about the PSBR.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a shame to detain the hon. Gentleman a further moment from getting on to the flat-rate tax, on which I am sure that we shall have another entertaining debate.<br><br>
Is the hon. Gentleman quoting the 37¾ per cent. figure as being consistent with the desire of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
Chancellor and the Prime Minister because it comes half way between their respective objectives of 40 and 35 per cent.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was most amused when some journalists telephoned me and other Conservative Back Benchers to comment on the so-called divisions between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. That was entertaining. I have some respect for financial journalists but they seem to have great difficulty in holding on to their papers for a long time. When I asked some of them whether they had looked at the Red Book produced by the Chancellor in November—it forecast that public expenditure would be reduced to 37¾ per cent. of GDP—they said, "Oh dear, we haven't". The Prime Minister's and the Chancellors statements were entirely consistent. Indeed, the Chancellor recently wrote to the hon. Gentleman to tell him that he forecast well below 40 per cent. in the Budget statement. I think that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have always been consistent in their statements, but they were talking about different time horizons in the interviews that they were asked to discuss. The Chancellor discussed the situation leading up to the general election when we had a firm Red Book forecast of below 40 per cent. and the Prime Minister discussed a long-term aim for at least another three Conservative Governments of getting down to 35 per cent. I want to discuss the flat-rate tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Chancellor's forecast is dependant on a growth forecast of 3 per cent. with which one of his advisers agree? We are not even sure that he agrees with it now. Therefore, his 37.5 per cent. forecast will not be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Red Book forecasts were prepared before the French decided to have their little problems in December. I know that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that in my constituency of Dover we have had a tremendous feeling for the French for a long time—I shall not go into the details of that feeling, although one prominent Labour councillor recently said that the French hate us and we hate the French. I do not think that I could possibly comment along those lines.<br><br>
It would be appropriate were we to return to discussing the rate of taxation. In America, an interesting debate is going on and has been mirrored, to a certain extent, in Britain. It concerns the issue of smaller and larger Government. I am a firm believer that the election in the United States of America will have a little impact here, as we often have an impact on thinking in America. In terms of government and the rate of taxation, which are definitely interrelated, the United States and Britain have been moving towards smaller government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman quite sure that the debate is simply between big and small government? Is not it between centralised and devolved government? My reading of Mr. Gingrich in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
particular is that he wants to transfer powers from the centre in Washington on a subsidiary basis to the states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will fully appreciate that no Government have done more to decentralise power in the United Kingdom than the Conservative Government—[<i>Laughter.</i>] I shall not go into detail with a long list of the measures that the Government have undertaken in that regard, but it would be appropriate to emphasise that part of decentralisation is to make smaller government. I believe that better decentralisation is achieved if the Government's role in the national economy is reduced. That is where we get down to the interesting debate of whether public expenditure should be 40 per cent. or 35 per cent. of GDP. We then move on to the impact that that will have on the rate of taxation and to the issue of whether a flat-rate tax would be beneficial to a country such as the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I was grateful to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for his answer to my recent parliamentary question about the impact of a flat-rate tax, given a couple of preliminary assumptions. I suggested that a flat-rate tax might be introduced on the basis that the first £7,000 or £10,000 of each taxpayer's income be exempted from tax. On the face of it, some alarming figures were produced, until one analysed some of the assumptions behind them. It was shown that there could be an income tax revenue cost of between £18 billion and £51 billion. Bearing in mind that income tax revenue is only about £80 billion, that would represent a considerable change in the amount of tax revenue that was taken in. At the higher end of the range, that would be fiscally impossible to implement.<br><br>
When one considers that some of the assumptions that the Treasury made on my specific parliamentary question were based on keeping several allowances, one begins to realise that those assumptions do not necessarily equate to taking full account of how a flat-rate tax could operate. A flat-rate tax that abolished all allowances would enormously simplify the tax system, but would be a delicate issue for people who benefit from current allowances, some of which are sensitive. No one—certainly no Conservative Member—would propose a flat-rate tax unless the winners and losers had been carefully analysed and the tax minimised or avoided the need for losers. I have in mind allowances such as those for the elderly, which are well established. No one would propose that the elderly should lose out because of the introduction of a flat-rate tax.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The flat-rate tax none the less has benefits. Self-assessment will greatly benefit the country, but will involve the production of a large document because of all the allowances and calculations that our tax system requires. If we introduced a flat-rate tax, however, much of that documentation could go. Whether we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
could reduce it to the size of the postcard that Mr. Forbes has taken around the primaries in America is another matter. It would, however, be a wonderful achievement if we could get down to one side of an A4 sheet of paper for self-assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not possible in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The flat-rate tax would be better than the rate in the clause. If we want to avoid severe consequences for the public sector borrowing requirement and ensure that no one in the system loses out significantly, we must introduce a flat-rate tax of at least 15 per cent. To achieve that, we must carefully time the changes so that the economy can bear them.<br><br>
I am interested in my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary's response to my next point. As we move towards 1999 and the possibility of a negative public sector borrowing requirement—a public sector debt repayment in effect—we shall have opportunities to consider introducing a flat-rate tax as low perhaps as 15 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman analysed how a flat-rate tax would affect people in different income groups. The Central Statistical Office produces estimates of the net effect of taxation, such as the benefits for families in the five quintiles. What effect would the flat-rate tax have on the tax and benefit burden of people in the highest and lowest quintiles—those in the top and bottom 20 per cent. of the population?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will understand that much would depend on the allowance that existed before the rate of taxation was introduced. However, everyone accepts that many people on higher incomes would not pay tax at 40 per cent. under a flat-rate tax—they would pay no more than 15 per cent., as in my scenario. It is time that we questioned what benefits higher tax rates have brought us. Unemployment went up as the rate of taxation increased and hit 98 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Does he not think that the quickest route to a flat rate tax would be to abolish the higher rates of tax? In the 1980's when we cut the higher rates of tax, we got more revenue from the higher earners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The 40 per cent. rate was welcomed by many people but it is still very high and leads to avoidance. The number of methods of avoidance has been reduced in recent years, and the evidence backs up my hon. Friend's point that the revenue obtained from cutting the higher rates of tax is greater than was obtained from raising them—to as high as 98 per cent. at their peak.<br><br>
There is much evidence for, and a strong argument in favour of, the proposition that revenues could be increased even further if we could get down to a 15 per cent. rate of tax. People would go in for many fewer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
avoidance schemes, and at 15 per cent. there would not exist schemes and other arrangements for pensions. Moreover, all the allowances could be abolished at that sort of tax level.<br><br>
The benefit would be that many people who currently pay tax at 40 per cent. would recycle back into the economy the additional money that would not go in tax. The result could be a fall in unemployment and a rise in employment. It is possible too that there would be more savings and more capital creation.<br><br>
The debate about taxation should focus on how more wealth and capital can be created in the economy, and on how we can ensure that there is more investment. Labour Members argue that more investment in the economy is needed. Why not try abolishing the top rate of tax for a few years? Why not see whether that creates more wealth and capital in the economy, and whether it creates more employment?<br><br>
It would be helpful to have a good debate on the matter and to move towards a 15 per cent. flat rate of tax. At that level, we cold get rid of all the allowances that are given today. People would not lose out if the threshold attracting a nil rate of tax—what is, effectively, the personal allowance—was set relatively high. There would be many winners. At some stage in the economic cycle between now and 1999, we will have the opportunity to bring that flat rate of tax into being in a way that would ensure that the number of losers is either negligible or very small. The proposition is worth contemplating and examining.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In political terms, this is one of the most important clause stand part debates of the whole Bill. As the election approaches, we know that the Government will have two economic strategies. First, they will have a selective presentation of economic "facts", such as we saw in the Prime Minister's new year newspaper advertisements. They could be described as a quarter per cent. truth, or 1 per cent. truth. The speech that we have just heard, with its "facts" about Labour's borrowing in the 1970s and the Government's decentralisation of power, rated about 0.1 per cent. of truth.<br><br>
The Government's second strategy will concentrate on the headline rate of tax. That is how they will present evidence in support of the contention that they have reduced taxation to 24 per cent. Next year, they will want to bring that percentage down further at all costs.<br><br>
Labour Members will concentrate on countering those claims, and it will not be difficult. We have three messages to get across. First, an examination of direct tax—income tax and national insurance contributions—shows that people are still paying more now than when this Government came to power. Secondly, we will demonstrate how people are paying more of all taxes. Thirdly, we will point to the fundamental hypocrisy of the Conservative party in what was presented at the last election.<br><br>
As we are talking about income tax rates, let us go back to what emerged in the Finance Bill proceedings two years ago. At that time, it was accepted even by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
Opposition Members that income tax had gone down while indirect tax had gone up. In the Finance Bill debate two years ago, as a result of the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms Harman): who led the Opposition Treasury team at that time, aided by <i>The Times</i> and some parliamentary answers from the Treasury Minister, it emerged that people were paying more direct taxes from April 1994 then they did in 1979. The situation has not changed since. Income tax went up because of the allowance changes in 1995 and has come down slightly this year. Direct tax two years ago was very similar to what it is now.<br><br>
In answer to a parliamentary question in January 1994, the then Financial Secretary said that direct tax rates then were 21.9 per cent. of the average family's income, which was 1 per cent. more than in 1979. Research showed that the gap was even bigger because that answer had not taken mortgage interest relief into account.<br><br>
People began to explain why that gap existed. It is easier to disguise increases in income tax than in any other form of taxation. Even if the headline rate has come down, there have been other changes during the Conservatives' time in office. They have affected mortgage interest, national insurance contributions, which are up by 3.5 per cent, and—perhaps most fundamentally—allowances, which we shall discuss later.<br><br>
The key point is that personal allowances have fallen rapidly in relation to average earnings. That is why people have paid more in direct tax over the Conservative years. We are putting—and will continue to put—that fundamental challenge to the Government. One reason for that fall is that an employee on average wages now starts paying tax at 24 per cent. of the average income, whereas the figure was 36 per cent. in 1979. The whole direct tax equation must be considered, not just the standard rate but national insurances contributions, allowances and mortgage tax relief. We will draw that to the attention of the public.<br><br>
The total tax take is of even more basic importance to the public. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) has already pointed out that the typical family now pays 35.4 per cent. in tax, whereas it paid 32.2 per cent. in 1979. Of course, many of those increases have occurred in this Parliament. Thirdly, before the next election we will remind people—not that they need much reminding—of what the Government said at the last election and what they have done since. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East reminded us of the 22 tax rises and of the fact that the equivalent of 7p has gone on the basic rate since the last general election. The changes proposed by the clause make a small dent in that increase.<br><br>
We shall remind people of what Conservative Members said at the last election. In particular, I remind the Conservative Members on the Committee of what they said. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The burden of income tax has been reduced and only the Conservatives promise further reduction".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
He did add "when circumstances permit", so he was protecting himself slightly. The right hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ten good reasons to vote Conservative—(1) Keep taxes low."</p></blockquote>
I wonder what his constituents think about that now. The hon. Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin) must have been using the same Central Office brief, because he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ten good reasons to vote Conservative… (4) Low taxes."</p></blockquote>
The manifesto of the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) contains the key words "lower taxes". The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Robinson) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Now is not the moment for massive personal and business tax increases."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that they waited a few weeks after April 1992 to do that. The hon. Member for Dover said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Two vital messages to remember: 1. David lives locally… 2. David Shaw supports lower income tax".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Taxes have been cut. That is the choice. Between lower taxes and higher standards of living or higher taxes and a return to the shambles of the 1970s".</p></blockquote>
Conservative Members will be reminded of what they said then many more times before the next general election.<br><br>
Apart from the overall burden of taxation, our second main charge is that tax changes have been unfair in distributional terms. We do not oppose reductions in income tax but we want a more complete picture of how tax is raised to make reductions fairer. The Treasury Select Committee has drawn attention to that in its report this year. It stated that information on the distributional impact of tax changes should be made in the Red Book in future.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I hope that the Government will accept that. The analysis was done by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and appears in appendix 2 of the Treasury Select Committee report. Hon. Members should be aware of the distributional impact: it reflects the sort of pattern that we have often seen in Conservative years with the poorest two deciles losing out in this year's Finance Bill and deciles three and four gaining 5p and 35p respectively. At decile five, it is just above £1 and it increases gradually up to the highest decile which gains £7.30. As I say, that reflects a common pattern during the years of Conservative Government.<br><br>
A man on half average earnings with two children and an unmarried spouse will have had the proportion of income paid in tax increased by 33 per cent. since 1992. The tax rises over recent years have been especially cruel on those on low incomes. The Government like to present the 20 per cent. tax band as a measure to help low income groups, but we should remember that anyone earning up to £7,000 a year
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
before the Budget has not been helped in any way by the extension of that 20 per cent. band. That is why the Labour party advanced the idea of a 10 per cent. band to help people on low incomes. The pattern has been repeated in all the budgets since the last general election. The two 1993 Budgets and the Budget increases—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member mentioned fleetingly the lop tax. Will that rather illusory policy cover the whole area of our current 20p band or is it, as others have suggested, not quite so generous?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the measures will have to be phased in. We shall inherit an undesirable economic situation. Nevertheless, it is valid to express an intention in terms of fairness to the low paid and as part of our welfare into work package. The speed at which we make progress will obviously depend on the economic situation. That stands to reason. The Government are adopting a similar strategy in their policy on the 20p band—they are not making the changes all in one go.<br><br>
The 1993 Budgets were the big tax-increasing Budgets of this Parliament. The focus on national insurance contributions was especially unfair to the low paid. We must remember that national insurance is another direct tax. People do not generally distinguish between it and income tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that 1993 saw the biggest peacetime tax-raising Budget in British history, let alone of this Parliament? Is my hon. Friend also aware that the second biggest tax-raising Budget was that of 1981?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that information. Some people with short memories may recall problems in the previous two or three years but forget what happened earlier. There were some tax cuts in the late 1980s but they were focused especially on the very rich. It is worth recalling that the top 1 per cent. have gained 30 per cent. of income tax benefits since 1979, most in the late 1980s. Only 3.4 per cent. of their income had to be paid in the tax increases of 1993, which was less than the average of 3.9 per cent. There was some tax reductions then.<br><br>
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) reminded us of the early 1980's—a long time ago. National insurance contributions went up in 1980 and in 1981, and in 1981 personal allowances were frozen—that has also been a feature of the 1990s and we shall discuss that later. The Conservatives' period in office began with various tax increases; there were some reductions in the late 1980s; and now we have increases again. People should remember that pattern. The oft-quoted document produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies compared 1985 with 1995 and showed that a majority of families lost during that period, but the comparison was kind to the Government because it did not take into account the tax increases of the early 1980s.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
We should consider the distributional effects of the recent and past tax changes. It is typical of the Conservative party to want to increase the regressive tendency: the hon. Member for Dover has suggested that higher rates should be abolished. We shall come on to inheritance tax, which is more of the same—a tax that affects only a few rich people. The allowance for inheritance tax has been indexed way beyond the rate of inflation for the past 10 years, whereas other allowances, such as personal allowances, have regularly been frozen.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East said, the proposed tax reductions—which are mainly for the rich, although to some extent will apply to those on lower incomes, except for the bottom two deciles—will be offset by other tax increases, principally the Council tax. People will not distinguish between income tax and council tax. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has admitted that, on average, council tax in England will increase by 8 per cent., and in the next three years further increases in England will be equivalent to 2p on the standard rate. I do not have figures for Scotland, but I suspect that the position is worse there and that the figures are even higher. Edinburgh, where I come from, faces a 10 per cent. increase in council tax plus massive cuts, and Glasgow is talking about a 30 per cent. increase in council tax, which also includes massive cuts in services. In addition, prescription charges were increased last week.<br><br>
The Conservative party does not like us saying that the Government give with one hand and take with the other, but that is how people will perceive the meagre tax reductions that they will receive. As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East said, such as they are, the reductions are not proof of economic success: they have been produced through public expenditure cuts. Not one penny of the £3 billion tax reductions mentioned in the Red Book—which excludes the council tax increases—has been produced by economic success.<br><br>
The main problem has been the huge deterioration in the public sector borrowing requirement. I was amazed that the hon. Member for Dover had the nerve to criticise the Labour Government for having a borrowing requirement of 5.4 per cent. at the end of their term of office considering the high figures of the past three years, to which my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) referred. The hon. Member for Dover says that the position is improving, but the figure that we were given in December was very bad and borrowing is at the same level this year as last year. Many people are sceptical about whether the final figure will be £7 billion below last year's figure, which is the Chancellor's latest prediction, although that prediction may go the way of all the others he made last year.<br><br>
The fundamental problems affecting borrowing are economic growth and the mystery of the disappearing revenues—which the Treasury Committee dealt with at some length. Revenues from income tax, VAT and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
corporation tax are less than predicted. The Treasury Committee, with its Conservative majority, makes the point that the level of income tax yield relative to changes in employment is changing. That is not really a staggering statement, if we consider the nature of the employment market. The labour force survey, for example, tells us that in the three months to November, employment rose by 38,000—a rise of 47,000 in part-time employment, but a fall of 9,000 in full-time employment. That will have a major effect on tax revenues. Specific problems related to the changing labour market have affected tax revenues and, of course, the weakness of consumer demand will affect VAT. Last year, real disposable income fell for most of the year, all of which had an effect.<br><br>
As I said, the clause stand part debate is important because the Government's flagship economic policy hinges on the rate of income tax. But people are not stupid; they know what has happened to their standard of living and to the tax that they have had to pay. In spite of all the complexities of allowances and national insurance contributions, people know that they are worse off under the Conservatives. That will be one of the fundamental messages and battlegrounds of the next election.<br><br>
The tragedy of the Finance Bill and the Budget is that they propose no action to improve the fundamentals of the economy, which lead to the tax disaster with which people have been and continue to be confronted. All that the Bill proposes is the slashing of public investment to make way for tax cuts—there are no measures to stimulate private investment.<br><br>
The tax argument and the tax facts reflect the Government's economic failure. Whatever gloss Conservative Members try to put on the issue, and however desperate they become in trying to misrepresent the previous Labour Government's record, people will not be fooled: they will understand what has happened to their income and their taxation; they will remember what the Conservatives said at the last election and will rightly feel that they were cheated and deceived. The Conservative party will pay the price. I hope that they will pay it very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) in debates, whether on the Floor of the House or in Committee, not least because when he quotes me, he is usually sufficiently fastidious to quote the small print which attaches to some of my comments in election leaflets as well as the headlines. I am grateful to him for that.<br><br>
While listening to his speech, I was struck by a couple of points. I thought that he was uncharacteristically less than fair in taking account of the substantial reduction in the standard rate of income tax which has been experienced by the vast majority of taxpayers since the Conservative party has been in office. The rate has fallen from 33p in the pound to 24p. For that reason, apart from others, I warmly welcome clause 64.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary sought to elucidate Opposition comments about the famous, or infamous, prospect of a lop band of income tax with which those on the Labour Front Bench briefly appeared to flirt. I can only suppose that it will t urn out to be a chimera. It is not at all clear that the hon. Member for Oxford, East or any of his colleagues have costed that proposal—nor it is clear over what time scale they would introduce it. The electorate should be suspicious of that type of carrot being dangled before them.<br><br>
I want to open my remarks about clause 64 by reminding Committee members of the interests that are declared in the register. I am not saying that any of these is especially relevant to the clause, but it is always as well on such occasions for the Committee to be reminded of where and in what capacity hon. Members' outside interests lie. In so far as it takes a further step towards reducing the standard rate of income tax, clause 64 is welcome.<br><br>
I sought to catch your eye, Mr. Hill—I hope you will be as indulgent with me as with previous speakers—because this wide-ranging debate is a good opportunity to consider the arguments for adopting a single positive rate of income tax.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
From that point of view, I agree partly, although not 100 per cent. with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dover. I share some of his tax policy objectives, although not his francophobia. As he said, the move towards a single positive rate of income tax is a radical policy and requires careful consideration. It would, therefore, be better to implement it after a few years of careful planning, rather than immediately.<br><br>
The proposals' implications for the level of personal savings are important, and we must take full account of that. My research leads me to the interim conclusion that there is an important relationship between the structure, rates and system of income tax and the level of personal savings, which is encouraged by substantial and varied tax relief.<br><br>
We have developed a complicated and expensive tax relief and exemption structure, which is largely an historical legacy of high marginal income tax rates and powerful vested interests. Such interests are effective in gaining what often turns out to be a temporary and illusory advantage—it is usually blotted out or blocked off by subsequent tax changes.<br><br>
As I said to the hon. Member for Leith, the Government have progressively cut marginal income tax rates and simplified the tax structure by reducing the number of tax rates and bands. That has taken us in the right direction, and there is now less justification for the attenuated personal tax reliefs that remain. They are still costly, but nothing like as cumbersome and complicated as those that we inherited in 1979. Such reliefs include the married couples allowance, which cost taxpayers £2.7 billion at the latest estimate;
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
income tax relief on pensions, which totals £9.5 billion; and mortgage interest tax relief, which has fallen to £2.8 billion because the Government's steady policy—which I support—has allowed it to wither on the vine. Several other tax reliefs are allowable against income tax.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dover suggested, moves towards a single positive rate of income tax would have to be accompanied by the exemption of a substantial proportion of household income before any income tax was paid. That should mean that the average or effective rate of tax that is paid by middle-income households—that is the rate that counts—would be lower than the rates for high earners. That would make the tax structure progressive at the bottom of the income scale and proportional higher up. It is, therefore, a myth to say that that radical reform would remove the substantial progressive element in the current income tax structure. Michael Prouse's recent, interesting article in the <i>Financial Times</i> dealt with the American experience of such measures, and I commend it particularly to Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman goes further, does he accept that one of the difficulties is that if all tax raising and distribution were centralised—in other words, if it all came into one centre up the road and were then redistributed across the nation to the citizens—that would cause a problem? The argument in the United States and in other countries is for disaggregating tax-raising centres and bringing them much closer to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an argument for having tax raised as close as possible to the people and at as local a level as possible, but that is unrealistic in our country with its traditions. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee believe in the merit of transfer payments, as they are called, for certain deserving social causes and certain essential forms of public expenditure. I need cite only the recent arguments of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor for that point of view, which he strongly defended in his recent lecture at the London school of economics. I do not think that one would want to throw overboard that principle of our tax and social security system.<br><br>
There is something to be said for making tax as subsidiary as possible. That argument has already been made in Committee, and relates to the European as well as to the national situation. However, I do not want to strain your patience, Mr. Hill, by digressing too much.<br><br>
A single positive rate of tax on income from work—that is, on wages and salaries—would need to be matched by similar tax at source on all returns on capital, whether that is dividends, rents, or interest. Were such tax changes to be introduced, they would highlight two fundamental questions of tax policy.<br><br>
The first, as I have already suggested, regards the tax treatment of savings, especially in the current
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
situation, which is effectively double taxation with income derived from personal investment in companies. That often strikes those who benefit from such income schemes as, a priori, somewhat unjust.<br><br>
The second question that would have to be addressed is whether the tax system should be used for social engineering or even, in some cases, for attracting votes. Thus, it might aim to redistribute income between different groups or to encourage saving, owner occupation, marriage and many other social objectives. It is not clear that that is a wise trend if it is taken too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not feel that the Conservative party might be accused of using tax as a key issue for garnering votes? Does he recall any of the posters that were used by the Conservative party at the last election? Were they possibly in conflict with his argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not have in mind the posters that were used at the last general election. I was thinking of the characteristics of the tax system as it applies to income tax. Special lobby groups of the kind to which I referred earlier have been very effective over the years in arguing their corner for their particular tax break or form of tax relief. I was making what I hope was a fairly objective case in favour of a dispassionate consideration of all those pleas. The general argument for a broad tax base, for low rates and a simple structure, which I shall come to shortly, is a strong one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might make a simple, objective observation. During the last general election the Conservative party produced a poster that warned of Labour's tax bombshell of some £636 per family. Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the tax increase for an average family in Britain under the Conservatives since the last general election has been larger than that which their poster threatened a Labour Government would introduce?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to dwell on the point; I am sure that it would strain your patience, Mr. Hill. Suffice it to say that it strains credulity to hear from the hon. Gentleman or from anyone else that if there were to be a future Labour Government, their aspirations would not mean higher rates of tax and higher burdens of borrowing, as has always been the case in the past.<br><br>
There would be considerable advantages in moving, after suitable thought and preparation, to a single positive rate of income tax of, as my hon. Friend and Member for Dover suggested, perhaps 15 per cent. The first £5,000 of personal income would be exempt from tax and it would be assumed that all existing tax expenditures and reliefs relating to income tax would be abolished. Those are the premises behind my argument.<br><br>
The first advantage of a single rate would be greater simplicity in the income tax system when compared to the existing position, in which there are three positive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
rates, at least 15 reliefs and 15 exemptions as well as the structural relief of personal allowances that would have to reappear in some form if my proposal were adopted. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dover said, that ideal may be particularly attractive in the context of self-assessment after 1997. It would greatly simplify some of the calculations that taxpayers will have to make after that date.<br><br>
The second advantage would be the creation of a more cost effective and efficient income tax system. That should involve lower overhead expenditure in the Inland Revenue and in the tax-paying private sector to raise a given amount of tax. Less money would have to be spent on employing Inland Revenue officials or their counterparts, the accountants and tax advisers, in the private sector. Furthermore, there is a significant probability that more revenue would be raised from income tax than at present. As the hon. Member for Leith said, we are all concerned by the lack of buoyancy in income tax revenue. A rate of 15 per cent. on all personal income above a tax-exempt allowance of £5,000 per person could raise more revenue than the present system, with its 30 or so tax shelters and distortions that produce a narrower income tax base.<br><br>
The third advantage would be to enhance this country's competitive position internationally, a matter that all hon. Members care about. The more simple and attractive we can make our personal tax rates, the more likely we are to attract to these shores and to retain mobile and enterprising individuals, who might otherwise decide to create wealth and jobs elsewhere under different jurisdictions. Members of the Committee will be aware that I have made that point with increasing frequency in recent debates in the House. In the modern global economy there is growing competition between rival tax and regulatory jurisdictions. It is in our national interest not to fall behind in that new form of global competition.<br><br>
The fourth advantage would be the creation of a larger constituency of support for public expenditure restraint, which is dear to the heart of my hon. Friends. More people would pay tax on income at a reasonable average rate of tax. Therefore, more people would be likely to take a closer interest in the tax consequences of any proposed increase in public expenditure.<br><br>
The fifth advantage of the scheme should appeal especially to my hon. Friends. Such a reform would, by definition, reduce the opportunities for social engineering that now exist in the income tax system. I refer, of course, to the conscious use of the tax system by successive Governments of all parties to encourage this or that form of behaviour or sector of economic activity via the incentive mechanism of tax relief. We all know what I am talking about. This Government have used the tax system to encourage home ownership and personal pensions to mention but two prominent examples. Previous Labour Governments used the system to introduce high, almost sumptary, rates of tax, but were then obliged to cushion what would have been the otherwise penal effects on wealth creators. Such use of the tax system has created
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
considerable distortions and has led many people with taxable income to take too many decisions that are tax driven rather than taken on their merits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's proposal is extremely thoughtful and well-prepared, and he is making a strong case. However, is he not worried that if we abolished tax reliefs on savings, and especially on provision for pensions, two things may happen? First, the aggregate savings ratio in this country would be inclined to fall. One of the worrying aspects of the British economy is that that ratio has always been low by international standards and, sadly, remains so. Secondly, many people would not make provision for their pensions and would be inclined to spend their current income, so more people would be a burden on the state in their old age.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of that argument. I said earlier that the interaction between that aspect of the tax system and the tax system as it affects and encourages personal savings is probably the most sensitive and difficult question that would have to be addressed to anyone seriously propounding the case from the Front Bench.<br><br>
Having said that, one need only look to the newly emergent economies in Asia and the Pacific rim to find countries where there is a single positive rate of tax on income and where the incentive to save from the income thus left in people's pockets and handbags is considerable, because people realise that it is worth saving the surplus income for their old age.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to interrupt him a second time. On the analogy with the newly emergent economies in the far east, surely the issue is that they do not have the carrot, the incentive, to save out of taxable income that we have in this country. Instead, they have a considerable stick that we do not have, because the state does not provide—at least, not nearly as comprehensively as here—for the hazards of life, including the hazards of old age. People are driven to save because of the need to pay for their own health care and pensions. My hon. Friend is surely not suggesting that we should introduce such a stick here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I was not speaking of sticks. I had better pass swiftly on, in the interests of progress.<br><br>
The effect of the social engineering tendency in our income tax systems has reduced the revenue secured for the Exchequer below what it could otherwise have been, and has been a deterrent to enterprise and to mobile individuals.<br><br>
I have mentioned five factors, all of which provide strong, positive arguments that the Inland Revenue, Treasury Ministers and their advisers should consider carefully in the context of the Bill and of future
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
Finance Bills. I recognise that there are strong arguments on the other side, as several interventions have underlined, which would have to be taken into account. I do not want the Committee to have the impression that I am Panglossian or hyper-optimistic and that I do not see some of the difficulties.<br><br>
For example, I understand the difficulty of the first-year cost and the first-year impact on the Revenue. That is an important matter, but I suggest to Ministers that much would depend on the actual rate chosen for a single positive rate of tax, the actual amount of tax-free income and the extent to which existing tax reliefs and expenditures were abolished or curtailed as part of the package.<br><br>
It is also important to note that in terms of the macro-economic argument, the second-round and subsequent effects of such a reform package could be extremely positive if the package helped to bring about a higher level of overall activity in the economy, as I believe it would.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dover said, a tricky political problem is involved in almost any radical package of tax reform, because inevitably winners and losers are created. We as Members of Parliament tend to hear more from the losers while the winners slink away, having pocketed their gains with hardly a word of thanks to those who made the change.<br><br>
There is another argument, which my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary may touch upon, that tends to be used against any ambitious tax reform—the doctrine of the unripe time. Specifically, that tends to mean that such audacity is politically possible only in the first Budget of a new Parliament. Even then, it could well be argued that audacious and far-reaching tax changes, because of their economic and social consequences, should first be trailed in party manifestos. According to what is loosely described as the mandate theory of Government, there is strong case for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman arguing for the flat rate tax proposal to be included in the next Conservative manifesto?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am arguing that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor and my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury can consider the ideas and not make the glib assumption that it is ripe for discussion only in the United States. There may be a useful application for it in this country and consideration is all that I ask.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary may well touch too on what is my final point and one likely to be used against the flat-rate tax idea. A flat-rate tax might gratuitously deprive Ministers of one of their main levers for influencing economic and social behaviour in what many believe is the relatively painless and cost-free way of tax relief and exemptions. That belief is wrong. From the Treasury ready reckoner, I calculate that the total cost of tax expenditure and relief against income tax alone in 1995–96 is £52 billion. Even excluding the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
£27 billion of personal allowances that would be more than replicated in a radical reform package, that still leaves perhaps between £10 billion and £20 billion with which to finance the kind of tax reform package that I have spoken about.<br><br>
Taxation—its system, rates and structures—is undoubtedly at the heart of national politics, a point already made by the hon. Member for Leith, and helps to define where parties stand ideologically and philosophically. I hope that the Financial Secretary and his Front-Bench colleagues will give serious thought to the ideas that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Dover have put to them, which strike a chord of sympathy among many of my hon. Friends. I hope that they will engage constructively in debate, although I realise that it would be unrealistic to expect any definitive statements today. I want my hon. Friend to give the matter serious consideration because it is the way in which the world is moving in the long-run.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. I have listened to many interesting speeches from him in the House and in Committee and have had many positive private discussions with him. On tax reform, particularly income tax, he makes valid points.<br><br>
He did not, however, address the point that we are dealing with only one clause in a Bill that has 191 clauses and 35 schedules. I do not think that income tax can be taken out of the context of the extraordinary mosaic of revenue-raising procedures in this country, some of which date back hundreds of years.<br><br>
The flat-rate tax proposal had an outing this year from Mr. Steve Forbes, who is a millionaire and is therefore highly attracted by it. He is also a draft-dodger, and a tax-dodger and, according to <i>The Times</i> this morning, one of his chief advisers is a racist. I am astonished that his representative on the earth of England is the hon. Member for Dover, although he is not a draft-dodger or tax-dodger and I would under no circumstances accuse him of being a racist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He does not like the French.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, there we are.<br><br>
In advancing the case of Mr. Steve Forbes, the hon. Member for Dover is in dubious company. A similar case was advanced in the US primaries four years ago by Senator Paul Tsongas who proposed a flat-rate US tax of 17 per cent.—2 per cent. more than was advocated by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington in his theoretical discourse. The men in white coats came for Mr Tsongas and we have heard nothing more of him. Of the two Conservatives who contributed to the debate, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is under no circumstances, by the common recognition of the House, a candidate for the men in white coats. We can all agree that he, at least does not fit that bill. However, unless the strong claim for an immense tax reduction for the wealthy is not combined with a much broader tax reform along
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
the lines advanced by the Shadow Chancellor, my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), it will fall on stony ground. Even from a Conservative point of view, going into the next election with huge poster saying, "Vote Conservative and we will take away relief on mortgage repayments" will not command much support among the hon. Gentleman's colleagues.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) made an interesting intervention, citing the tiger economies of Asia, where income tax rates are indeed, much lower than they are in this country. But in exchange, the levels of compulsion and direction in other areas are much greater. For example, in Singapore, the central provident fund set up by the Government involves a 25 per cent. compulsory deduction from all income and a 15 per cent. deduction from the employer's payroll. That is an income tax or a tax for future provision under a different name. There is a greater element of individual control over the money thus deposited under the aegis of the state, but the law of the land says, "We won't take much away from you in the form of income tax, but we will take away 25 per cent. of your income to ensure that you make adequate provision for health, housing, pensions and so on."<br><br>
Similarly, the Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, introduced a compulsory pension scheme there to ensure that people are obliged to make some provision for their old age. It will be extremely interesting to see whether it is maintained after 1997.<br><br>
Let us consider the Asian tigers—a part of the world about which I am knowledgeable. In Korea, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan there is much greater concern that, because they have so effectively shot fast and high in their overall growth rate, they have crashed through areas of development that took 100 or more years in this country. If the graphs are extrapolated, one finds that their demographic timebomb—to use that cliché—is much more serious than that of Britain or the rest of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is correct about that. It is certainly true that, in prospect, Japan is a more ageing society than most western European societies. However, the more vibrant economies of south-east Asia—Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore—are young societies and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am praying in aid the Prime Minister of Singapore, who pointed out that, by 2020, more than 30 per cent. of the Singapore population will be aged 60 or over. Singapore has been so successful in raising life expectancy and health standards, that it will have an old population relatively quickly—in 20 or 25 years, which is just a blink in the construction of a society.<br><br>
China is not a richly endowed country, but on present life projections, it will have 300 million people over the age of 60 by 2020. As the economy takes off,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
people move, create enterprises and shift from one part of the country to another. That is perhaps less possible in Singapore, but as I know from experience in Malaysia people come from cantons into the cities. As they do so, the old family networks, which looked after old people, simply disappear.<br><br>
I share, in part, the desire of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington for a debate on reforming our tax system. He referred to sumptary taxes, as if those were a mediaeval concept for punishing the elders of a city as they wandered around in their cloaks of ermine, eating over-ripe oysters, as Browning might have said.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Conservative policies for the past 16 years have encouraged sumptuous consumption—the message has been, "if you've got it, flaunt it". The growth in the number of millionaires and the extraordinary sight of the rich descending from their rolls-royces to step gently over beggars on their way to clubs, watering holes and opera houses testify to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It sounds like the old Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that the hon. Member for Dover mentions the Soviet Union, because elements of "Animal Farm" are visible in current Conservatism. The pigs looked at the humans and back and found that they could not tell the difference. That sums up the nose-in-the-trough philosophy of contemporary Conservatism.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington will have to deal with the sumptuary point. If a flat rate of taxation is to produce the benefits he outlined—I accept that there is force in his argument—there must be a change in culture, so that the tax is not interpreted as an immense reward for the wealthy. We are rightly moving from the 17th to the 21st century, but we must be careful that, as we strip from the dukes and earls their right to be lawmakers because of their birth, we do not replace their right to vote with a right to spend, spend, spend.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman wants to go down the road of flat-rate taxes—and I am willing to discuss it with him—we must examine other mechanisms for creating a tax structure that restores social cohesion, represents the values of one nation, and does not further divide our society into two nations; one based on the rich, and the other on an ever-growing army of poor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In their advocacy of a flat-rate tax, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, meekly and moderately, and the hon. Member for Dover, rashly and boldly, set out the Conservative vision of tax policy for the future. They propose to redistribute the tax burden from the better off to ordinary middle class people, pensioners and the poor. It shows consistency, because for the 16 years for which it has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
been in Government, the Conservative party has raised taxes for those at the middle and lower end of the income spectrum, and reduced the tax burden at the top end.<br><br>
The arguments that the hon. Member for Dover presented were based on Tolkein economics—they showed a mystical, romantic, gothic belief in turning history into anything that one wants it to be. He said that when higher rates of income tax were greater, they caused unemployment to lift off. That does not square with the facts. The one and only tax pledge in relation to which the Conservative party can put its hand on its heart and claim that it has delivered its promise is the reduction of the higher rate. Whenever the higher rate has been reduced, unemployment has risen significantly—and is structurally twice the level, in real terms, of it peak under the last Labour Government.<br><br>
The flat-rate tax also fails the fairness test, which the Conservative party seems to have forgotten about, but which the public understand. They realise that the burden of taxation has been shifted from the top to the middle and they consider that to be unfair. A party that abandons the fairness test on taxation abandons public opinion and loses public support.<br><br>
The penny has dropped. The public now realise that the talk of cutting taxes is not reflected in the amounts that they see deducted from their salaries every month or week or the taxes that they pay in shops or to local government. The Conservative party has been rumbled. Regardless of their bluster and pretence, people do not believe that the Conservatives are a party of low taxation. People believe the evidence of their eyes and the truth revealed in their bank balance more than Conservative party propaganda.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dover suggested that if the tax burden on the better-off were reduced, they would recycle that extra money to provide opportunities and increase the incomes of those less fortunate than themselves. A parallel argument was made in the late 1980s, when Lord Lawson reduced the higher rate of income tax from 60 per cent. to 40 per cent. Charities said that the move would hit their covenant incomes. They were reassured that, because so much more money was in the pockets of the better-off, increased donations to charity would more than make up the difference. The Charities Aid Foundation knows that the net take for charities went down after that tax cut. People did not use the extra money in their pockets to help those who were less fortunate than themselves, they used it to help themselves.<br><br>
The following day's press coverage summed up the effects of the Budget. The <i>Financial Times</i> said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In his third Budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke…helps richer people more in cash terms than the poor. In fact, his largesse did not extend to those on the lowest incomes at all."</p></blockquote>
It also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"These tax cuts are small by comparison with the tax increases introduced since 1993 by Mr. Clarke and his predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
According to the <i>Financial Times,</i> we had an 8p up, 1p down Budget. The public understand that. They know that they were taken for a ride by those posters during the general election campaign, in which it was alleged that Labour could not be trusted on tax. They have learnt from the evidence that a Conservative Government cannot be trusted on tax.<br><br>
The Prime Minister promised that there would be no increase in the scope of VAT, but it was expanded to include fuel. He promised that national insurance contributions, which are a tax on income, would not be increased, but they were. The Conservatives made promises to the electorate and then broke them. The public now know that not a word of what the Conservatives say on tax can be trusted. The Conservatives are naked and their cover is blown. They promised tax cuts and they have delivered tax increases for most people.<br><br>
Last month, I asked the Library statistician to calculate the changes in the tax burden on the British people year by year since the Conservatives came to power and to compare it with the tax burden under the previous Labour Government. I expected the results to show a punishing rate of tax on the British people at many points during the Conservative tenure of office, but nothing could have prepared me for the evidence of those figure, which show that tax in real terms has been higher in every year since 1979—during which time the Conservatives have been in power—than it was in 1978–79 under the last Labour Government. Last year, the amount of money raised by the Exchequer in taxes, royalties and national insurance totalled £236.6 billion; in 1978–79, at current prices, that figure was £170.9 billion. The actual amount raised in 1978–79 was £58.6 billion, which is £170.9 billion in today's prices. In some ways, that illustrates what has happened to the value of the pound during the period in which the Conservatives have been in power.<br><br>
If the Conservatives had kept tax in real terms down to the level that they inherited from the last Labour Government, they would have taken £735 billion less out of the pockets of the British people. That amounts to an additional £2,053 taken per household, per year in each of the 16 completed tax years that the Conservatives have been in office. Yet the Conservative party parades itself as the party of lower taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the hon. Gentleman mind coming back to clause 64, which deals with income tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the advice.<br><br>
In relation to income tax especially, Conservative Members might argue that the burden of income tax would be expected to rise in real terms because the economy has grown. That is a poor argument from a party that claimed to want to reduce the size, scope and spending of the state.<br><br>
I asked the Library to prepare figures broken down to show income tax and other taxes as a proportion of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
gross domestic product. Those statistics show that, in 1978–79, the tax burden took 34.3 per cent. of Britain's GDP. The average during the 16 years that the Conservatives have been in office has been 37.3 per cent.—it has been three percentage points higher, on average, under the Conservatives than in Labour's last year of office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say that, and he is welcome to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That particular statistic is laid out on a comparable basis on page 87 of the Red Book. I remind the hon. Gentleman that it is not enough to look at Government receipts in isolation as a proportion of money GDP; the amount of Government borrowing must also be added—receipts and borrowing must be considered together. The hon. Gentleman will see that, when Labour left office, borrowing and Government receipts were 43¼ per cent. of GDP, whereas today Government receipts and the public sector borrowing requirement together are down to 42 per cent. of GDP and falling. By the time of the general election, that figure will be down to 40 per cent. of GDP—some 4 per cent. less than what Labour took out of the economy via Government receipts and public sector borrowing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a good shot, but the hon. Gentleman's reading of the table is highly selective. The hon. Gentleman should draw a line under the 1994–95 figures because those are the figures that we know to be accurate. Figures beyond that year are only projections. We know from the Chancellor's 1995 Budget speech that for the 1994 Budget, he made the greatest errors in the economic projections that have been made by a Chancellor during peacetime—perhaps the greatest ever, although I do not know what happened at the start of the second world war. I suspect that the projections then were, understandably, found to be awry.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should reflect on the figures that he used. He mentioned that the total figure for 1978–79 was 42¼ per cent. under a Labour Government; however, in 1994–95, it is 42¾ per cent., so the trend is going in the wrong direction. The Chancellor's predictions may bring a better performance in the future, but we do not know that they will. It is wishful thinking on the part of Conservative Members to assert that things will get better. All members of the Committee hope that they will, but we need to see evidence before we pat the Chancellor on the back and congratulate him on his performance.<br><br>
In conclusion—you will be pleased to hear that I am coming to the end of my speech Mr. Hill—the figures that the Library provided show that the Tories' claim to be a party of low taxation is not borne out by the facts.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
Those facts were independently calculated and show that there has been an increase in the proportion of this country's gross domestic product—which is created by the people of this country—that is taken out of the pockets of the people of this country in the form of taxes imposed by the Conservative Government. That proves the old adage that a lie gets round the world before truth has got its boots on. However, truth is now fully shod, and the people of Britain now understand what has happened. The Conservative Government have taken them for a ride. They voted Tory on a promise of lower taxation, but they have paid higher taxes. The penny has dropped and they will not make the same mistake again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have my eye on the clock, and I shall be very brief, Mr. Hill. I was prompted to rise to my feet by the contributions of the hon. Members for Dover and for Carshalton and Wallington, who argued for a flat-rate tax. We have had a flat-rate tax before: it was called poll tax; it cost the country £14 billion; and it was riddled with unfairness and inequities. That was why the Government got rid of it and brought in the council tax, which has not two or three but eight bands. It has that many because property is widely seen as a proxy for wealth, and it should be taxed.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for York said, the tax burden has never been heavier. People have been crushed under the increased taxes that the Government impose on people. The world outside will never again trust what Conservative Members say about tax. The hon. Member for Dover was clutching at straws when he said that the 40 per cent. figure would save the Conservatives at the next general election. The penny has dropped, and people will not be fooled again.<br><br>
What is wrong with taxes being used to redistribute wealth? Our society in Britain is very unfair. It is astonishing to read that the most wealthy 50 per cent. of the population own 92 per cent. of the wealth; that implies that 8 per cent. of the wealth is owned by half the population. Figures that were cited earlier show that the top 1 per cent. with regard to income—those who earn more than £120,000 a year—have received 30 per cent. of the tax cuts since 1979. Ours is an unequal and unfair society, and the tax system should be used to redistribute wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a wide-ranging debate. It would be churlish of me not to remind hon. Members on both sides of the Committee what clause 64 is about and why I hope it will stand part of the Bill. It reimposes income tax for 1996–97 and sets the rates of income tax and the size of the tax bands. The basic rate is reduced from 25 per cent. to 24 per cent, but the lower and higher rates remain at the same level as in 1995–96. The lower rate limit is set at £3,900, an increase of £700—£500 more than indexation—and the basic rate limit is set at £25,000, an increase of £1,200 or 20 per cent. over indexation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
By cutting the basic rate of income tax to 24 per cent. and increasing the lower rate band by £700, we are taking two of the three steps towards our goal of a 20 per cent. basic rate—an achievable 20 per cent. basic rate, not one of the illusory ideas of Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about a 15 per cent. rate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) mention a 50 per cent. rate of tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, 15 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we had flushed out their high-rate proposals.<br><br>
The increase in the lower rate band means that about a quarter of all taxpayers—6.3 million people—will now pay tax only at the 20 per cent. rate. That deals conclusively with many of the Oppositions points.<br><br>
In all, 26 million taxpayers gain from the proposals in the clause. To pick up on a point made by the hon. Member for York, 220,000 are taken out of tax completely.<br><br>
In this smoke and mirrors debate, with the Opposition trying to clothe themselves in a veil of respectability as a tax-cutting, low-tax party, the hon. Member for York should have asked the Library what would have happened if we had carried on indexing the Labour tax regime as it was in 1978–79. He might be interested to know that 1 million more people would be paying tax today. I hope that he would be able to face them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is extremely kind. [<i>Laughter.</i>] He is suggesting that because people are taken out of tax, the people at the bottom are benefiting. Tax table published by the newspapers the day after the debate showed that a married self-employed man with two children on £3,500 a year would lost just over £2 a week as a result of the Budget. The same man on £5,000 a year would lose £2.46 a week. At the other end of the scale, a similar family on £100,000 a year would gain £33. If the Government want to reduce the tax burden on people on lower incomes, they have not done so with this Budget. How do they intend to achieve that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I could talk at length about the assistance given by the Government through family credit to low-income families who want to stay in work. However, I shall desist from that.<br><br>
The debate was notable for the Opposition not having the confidence to put before us their tax proposals. We have heard only a smoke and mirrors argument outlining why they want to attack our tax proposals, which are going in the right direction of reducing tax. Where is the 10p tax? It has gone into the dustbin of bad ideas. The Opposition have realised that it would cost £8 billion and many Opposition
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
Members would like to see that money spent on other things. That reinforces the opinion that when it comes to tax, Conservative Members are intuitive tax cutters and Labour Members are intuitive tax raisers and spenders. They want to increase public spending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What specific tax proposals did Lord Howe and Lord Lawson put to Committees considering finance Bills during the late 1970s?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was not a member of those Committees in the late 1970s, I choose not to answer that question. But as my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington knows because he was there at the time, the noble Lord Lawson indulged in a fearsome reduction in higher rates of tax. That is why the Conservative party was elected in 1979—in case it had escaped the hon. Gentleman's notice—on an agenda to reduce tax rates in this country. We have carried that out. Even through the difficult recession when the Opposition chastised us for raising taxes, we did not increase those marginal rates of income tax. We protected people from that and maintained the work incentive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister offer a simple explanation of why, if the Government have set that tax-cutting agenda, an average family is paying a higher proportion of its income in tax than it was paying in 1979, and why taxes as a share of national income are higher than they were in 1979?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I shall be delighted to deal with that point. In relation to the narrow issue raised by the hon. Member for York about the percentage of GDP made up of income tax and national insurance, I remind the Committee that, in the year 1978–79, 17¼ per cent. of GDP was accounted for by income tax and national insurance charges. In 1996–97, that figure is projected to be 15½ per cent. of GDP. The hon. Members for York and for Oxford, East cannot run away from the simple fact that, under the last Labour Government, the PSBR averaged 7 per cent. Under the Conservative's tenure of office, it has averaged 2½ per cent. I suspect that the only talk that we will hear about the lop tax is what the tax rate would have been under a Labour Government. They would have had to increase tax by some 10p in the pound. That is the only 10p tax that the Opposition understand, which would have been imposed on the British people, if the Opposition had had the honesty to tell us that their level of borrowing disguised their level of tax.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, we have heard enough from the hon. Member for York.<br><br>
The Government have made an honest proposition about taxation. We have laid out our plans in the Red Book for the British people to judge. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor had to make difficult choices during the past two years when he had to increase taxes—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—I do not shy away from that because the Conservative party is capable of making difficult decisions. The Opposition have shown in debate that they are not even capable of defending their policy of the lop tax or the windfall tax. They have not tabled those issues for debate or had the courage to advocate those arguments here today. We understand what they are saying and why they are saying it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East mentioned 22 tax increases. Those were made as a result of difficult decisions by the Chancellor but, as a result, our economic policy has delivered the best inflation rate for 50 years, the lowest mortgage rate for 30 years, unemployment is falling, the British economy is one of the strongest in Europe, export levels are rising and Britain is number one in growth in inward investment. That was summed up very well in a balanced article in <i>The Times</i> at the beginning of this week entitled,
<br><blockquote><p>"Warm Economic Front".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"Cheerful government forecasts are not wishful thinking".</p></blockquote>
That makes uncomfortable reading for Opposition Members, but it justifies our position.<br><br>
On living standards, I see that the Opposition have fought shy today of trying to run their argument and have not challenged the figures that we issued at the time of the Budget, which showed that the average family on average wages would be £450 a year better off as a result of a combination of rising earnings and tax reductions. That is the benefit of the tax proposals contained in clause 64.<br><br>
In considering the overall burden of taxation, I remind the hon. Member for York that, when the OECD examined the question of the tax burden in 1993, the United Kingdom was 33—</span></p>
