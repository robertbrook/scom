	<p>[MR. JAMES HILL 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
	<p>	<b>(Except clauses 36, 105, 112 and 139 and schedule 15)</b></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. On Friday afternoon, the Government tabled 166 amendments on the subject of loan relationships, which appeared on the amendment paper yesterday. I wonder whether you have had time to study and take in their full impact and meaning, Mr. Hill, because I am sure that most members of the Committee have not. That is further evidence that the Government are in chaos and show contempt for Parliament, the public, the Committee and the many businesses that will be affected by this far-reaching legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have clearly admitted that they have made a hash of drafting the Bill. They should have discovered their mistake earlier and tabled the amendments in sufficient time to allow proper consultation and public comment. They should not drive them through the Committee, as they plainly intend to. It would be better to defer consideration of the relevant provisions, or to withdraw them and return to them in another Bill—perhaps a future Finance Bill. Parliament and the public have been treated with contempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everything was in order. The amendments were tabled on Friday, and it is now Tuesday morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the clauses because they are complex. They deal with taxation changes—primarily with regard to corporate finance. They have been subject to extensive consultation, which is why so many amendments now appear on the amendment paper. We have consulted with all the representative bodies and with numerous companies, which suggested many amendments that they felt would make the Bill more satisfactory for the affected companies. The majority of companies with straightforward borrowings will, of course, scarcely be affected by the Bill, if at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All parties were well aware of the consultation process—indeed, the Labour party spoke to many of the bodies—and the amendments are the result. I have offered those Opposition Members who want to speak the possibility of an official briefing. The amendments were not intended to make life difficult for the Committee. Those with whom we consulted said loudly and clearly that they do not want the changes—which they proposed—to be delayed. They want the
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
Bill on the statute book so that corporate loans can continue under the new taxation provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my point of order, Mr. Hill. I do not want to detain the Committee, but extensive amendments have been tabled at the last minute, and that raises an important principle. It clearly make sense to take notice of consultation. We saw with self-assessment, however, that the Government did not get their approach right the first time and had to rush legislation through. We therefore have good grounds for thinking that they may not have got it right now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have had the opportunity for proper consultation on the amendments, which substantially change the content of important, complex and far-reaching provisions in the Bill. The amendments are another example of the Government introducing legislation in haste and discovering their mistakes at leisure. That brings our proceedings into contempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. Consultation started last May and gave rise to the amendments. When we initiated the consultation process, we talked about changes to allow the gilts strips market to go ahead. The practitioners whom we consulted wanted the changes to be spread more widely. It would have been wrong for us to ignore their proposals and not amend the Bill. They did not want us to delay the matter. In tabling the amendments, we sought to do what the Government and the Committee ought to do, which is to meet the requirements of those who are affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee for the timing of the amendments. Many of them cascade from earlier amendments. If we had tabled them earlier, before the consultation was completed, they would not have been coherent. It is a complicated area. The consultation period was long and the amendments are in response to the requirements of the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. I am sure that the hon. Lady does not want to mislead the Committee, so I would like to clarify two points that she has just made. She said that all the people whom the Government consulted said that they sought no delay. Will she confirm that that is the view of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and the Institute of Chartered Accountants? It was suggested to us, albeit before these complex amendments were tabled, that that was not their view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady suggested that the amendments were tabled as a result of consultations that had begun in May. Will she confirm that the consultation that began on 25 May ended on 10 July when the Inland Revenue published a press release setting out its proposals and that there was no further consultation until after 29 November, when 93 pages of draft legislation were published? The amendments, therefore, are a result of consultation that ran not from 25 May but from 29 November and did not end until 12 January. That is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
significant date, because the Bill was published on 4 January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you comment, Mr. Hill, on the procedures used by the Government? They introduced a Bill on 4 January knowing that the consultation that they had undertaken would not end until 12 January. That is likely to produce chaos, because this is a complex and important area of the Bill. Should the Government be able to do that in future? Should not you express your displeasure, Mr. Hill, at the way in which the Government have proceeded?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in effect, Mr. Hill, you are the Speaker of the Committee and seek to protect the reputation of Parliament as a legislative forum. Is it right for such a substantial change to be rushed through, given that it affects thousands of businesses throughout the country and is enormously complex? The amendments were tabled—I am not suggesting that they were not in order—on Friday after lunch, which is the latest possible time that they could be tabled, on a non-sitting day. It was likely that the Opposition would not get full sight of them until they were printed on Monday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons for Governments tabling amendments on non-sitting days. First, by behaving surreptitiously they hope to reduce the Opposition's opportunity to debate fully and understand the clauses. That is a breach of the proper operation of Parliament and it is a disgrace. I am sure that you will agree with that, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Governments do that because they have problems. Perhaps the Government were still drafting their amendments on that Friday morning, which suggests that they were prepared to hold the Committee in contempt by introducing a badly drafted Bill. Either way, their action undermines the reputation of Parliament and the right of Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen properly to consider amendments. The rights of Back Benchers on both sides of the Committee should also be properly considered. The Government have provided no proper notes on amendments and we have had no proper or full explanation. All that we have heard from the Economic Secretary is a brief explanation along with a couple of letters that arrived yesterday. That is unsatisfactory, it is a bad way to make law and it will lead to bad law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the organisations that we have consulted. I met representatives of the Chartered Institute of Taxation on Valentine's day—of the many things that one does on Valentine's day, meeting the Chartered Institute of Taxation was a new one—and they wanted the legislation to proceed. As to the other names read out by the hon. Gentleman, the Institute of Chartered Accountants wanted the legislation to continue. I have a list of names which I will let the hon. Gentleman have. Without searching through them, I cannot tell him whether the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland is on the list. However, of all the
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
organisations that I saw, not one wanted the clauses not to proceed or not to be implemented at the usual time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second question dealt with the consultation and was a fair point. When the consultation started in May, it aimed primarily to ensure that the taxation system would allow the strips market in gilts to proceed. As a consequence of that consultation, after which we had information from all those with whom we had discussed the issue, there was overwhelming pressure for us to broaden the taxation system to encompass all corporate debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the measures would affect thousands of companies. I suggest that he looks a little closer. Because most companies have straightforward borrowings with banks, the hon. Gentleman will find that, in fact, the measure touches them a little or not at all. The companies that it will affect are those with complex borrowings and that is why the consultation has been long and extensive. Between July and the publication of the draft clauses, officials from the Inland Revenue discussed the proposals in a variety of forums, groups and meetings—the Revenue estimates that 2,000 or 3,000 practitioners were involved. The consultation was extensive. I, too, would have liked the draft clauses to be available earlier than they were, but I am assured that that was not possible. The lesson that needs to be learned is that when draft clauses deal with an issue which is not in itself politically contentious—this issue alters the taxation of corporate debt—they should be made available as early as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the publication of the draft clauses, the question about when the consultation period stopped rather answers itself. Although there is an effective date on the consultation period, we have not stopped talking with any of the bodies which want to discuss the matters with us, because it is right and proper that we should continue to have a close relationship with them. That relationship must continue after the Bill is enacted so that it achieves what it is expected to achieve and what both sides want it to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next issue that was raised by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) dealt with the tabling of the amendments. I assure the Committee that had it been possible to table them earlier, I would have done so. I briefly notified the hon. Gentleman on Thursday that amendments would be tabled on Friday. I intended to get the amendments to members of the Committee over the weekend and it was only on Monday morning that I found that that had not been possible. Again, I apologise to the Committee for that. However, so that proper scrutiny can take place, I have offered the hon. Gentleman a briefing with officials. It is right and proper that such a briefing be offered under the circumstances. We are trying to ensure that this aspect of the legislation is correctly implemented and accepted by the Committee, and amended as wanted by those who will deal with it when the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise again for tabling the amendments on Friday, which was a non-sitting day. That was not within my power. I assure you, Mr. Hill, that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
number of amendments is in no way meant to be disrespectful to you, to members of the Committee or to Parliament. It makes more sense to table amendments to ensure that the legislation is right than to pretend that such amendments do not have to be made. It is also common sense to ensure that we continue to discuss with practitioners so that the Bill is passed in the form in which they want it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. We appreciate the Economic Secretary's apology but she has not answered adequately the points that my hon. Friend and I have made. It seems from what she said that Government Ministers are not fully in charge of events. That bears out the claim of chaos in the Government to which I referred earlier. When will explanatory notes be available to members of the Committee so that we may understand the meaning and impact of the amendments and new clause? Will the offer of a briefing, which she has made to my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire be extended to all members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. I will endeavour to ensure that the briefing information is made available today. However, my understanding is that such a briefing has not been offered to members of the Finance Committee before. I made the offer because of particular circumstances. I thought that the appropriate route forward was to ensure that that briefing was available to the hon. Member who would lead for the Opposition on that issue. Perhaps we may discuss the offer in a few moments, if it is satisfactory to you, Mr. Hill, and to members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. I have no wish to prolong the discussion but while we appreciate the hon. Lady's apology, what she has said is not good enough. The procedure is not good enough. We move forward having registered our protest at the contemptuous way in which the Committee and the public are being treated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. I do not believe that it is fair to say that the Committee has been treated contemptuously. I have made a full and fair offer to members of the Committee and I hope that they will take it as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is important and complex. It requires and will continue to require a significant amount of consultation and contact with practitioners in the field. I do not mean to be disrespectful in any way when I offer members of the Committee an opportunity that they have never been offered in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. I have been an
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
interested spectator for the past 20 minutes but what the hon. Lady has just said is not true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1992, exactly the same facility was offered to Opposition spokesmen. I use that term advisedly, because the offer was not made just to the hon. Member who led in the subject under discussion—foreign exchange dealings—who happened to be me, but to all of us. It was an extremely useful offer, because it became abundantly obvious during the proceedings that although Opposition Members were new to the subject, so too were the Treasury Ministers. The officials were the only people who understood what was going on. It might, therefore, be advisable for the hon. Lady to extend exactly the same facilities and to attend herself—she might even benefit. I am sure that it was quite inadvertent, but the hon. Lady did mislead the Committee and she might want to correct herself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. I inquired about the practice and was told that such an offer had not been made to the Committee before. If it has, then clearly the hon. Gentleman is right and I apologise for my information being incorrect and for the phrase that I used. However, the offer of consultation still stands and I hope that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire and I can discuss the procedure in a few moments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hill. I join this interesting discourse between our Front Bench Members as a humble Back Bencher. I find it appalling that the amendments have been tabled in such a way that we have had no chance to examine them or to consult specialist bodies. They are technical amendments, but they will affect firms in my constituency. The Finance Committee has been treated with something not much short of contempt. Perhaps Treasury Ministers—at least the key absentee, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the right hon. Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Waldegrave)—have other matters on their minds, but Opposition Members welcome the action of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 14, tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), insists on a 60-day consultation period for the public. Members of the House and of the Committee have not had even a 60-minute consultation period and it behoves the Minister to make a much more generous and clear concession; she could put off discussion of the amendments until we have had a chance to think about the issue. It is intolerable that the Economic Secretary should go about matters in such a way; that would not have been tolerated even on Sheffield city council. The hon. Lady should be ashamed of behaving like that in the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will agree that we have had a fairly long discussion on that point of order. Concessions by the Government may have helped the situation and we had better move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>LOANS TO PARTICIPATORS ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the clause will amend section 419 of the Taxes Act 1988. That section imposes a charge to tax when a closed company—a company controlled by five or fewer participators—makes a loan to one of its participators. I also understand that when a closed company makes a loan, it is required to account for tax as if the loan were a dividend. That is an understandable, anti-avoidance measure. If the loan is repaid, the tax is repaid by the Revenue. At present, when a company makes a loan, tax on it is due 14 days after the end of the accounting period in which the loan is made. I understand the clause to amend that system with the aim of simplifying it and providing that taxes be paid or repaid—because the tax becomes repayable if the loan is repayable—at the end, not of a 14-day, but of a nine-month accounting period. Yet what is to stop a closed company making a series of loans over a period amounting to, say, eight months and 3 weeks and thereby altogether avoiding paying tax? I understand that the de minimis rule must apply at some point, but is it possible for companies effectively not to pay any tax because of the longer accounting period which means that the loans will have been made and repaid within the much longer period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point arises from that. The Law Society has told us that in its view the clause does not make it sufficiently clear that if the loan is repaid within nine months there will be no tax due. If that uncertainty exists, we might be creating a larger loophole. If the measure simplifies the tax, reduces costs and makes the system more effective, that is fine but it would be helpful if the Financial Secretary—I presume that he is the Minister on the Treasury Bench dealing with the issue—told us what problem the clause is intended to remedy.

Friend, I want to clarify one matter. My hon. Friend spoke about loans being repaid within the nine-month period. It is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
clear from the Bill whether a company could offer a loan to a family member at the start of the financial year and avoid paying advanced corporation tax if it is repaid within 21 months. We need a fuller explanation of the accounting period. I have spoken to people who have told me that tax is payable 14 days after the end of a company's financial year, rather than in the present accounting period. Will the Minister confirm that we are talking about extending the period from 12 to 21 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) rightly probes me on some points relating to the anti-avoidance proposition. His first point was why the measure is being introduced. I should like to take the hon. Gentleman back to an exercise established by my right hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Dorrell), when Financial Secretary, who pursued ways of simplifying the tax system. He held a meeting with representative organisations as part of his exercise. The view taken there was that the old period of 14 days for settling tax on loans at the end of the accounting period was a complicated exercise—usually because of the complex nature of the loans offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to familiarise myself with how the system worked in the real world. The picture painted was of a close relationship between those who owned the company and the company itself. Sometimes it was difficult for individuals to ascertain whether moneys received from the company were loans until the accountant did the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can it be difficult to ascertain whether an amount of money is a loan? Surely people in receipt of moneys must be sure about its basis. There must be some intention—a term central to many discussions at present—on the part of the person paying the money as to whether it is a loan, a gift, a dividend or income. How can there be uncertainty about that? The treatment actually given by an accountant may be different from what should properly be given, which should reflect the intention of the parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any difficulty in deciding whether moneys received by a director of closely controlled companies are a loan. If the director is spending the majority of his or her time in running the business, however, and has made arrangements for drawings to be made from within the company, at the instant of receipt of the said moneys the immediate proposition suggested by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central may not be uppermost in his—the director' s—mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of the anti-avoidance law is about simplifying the administration, not altering the legal basis. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of current legal provisions since his questions relate to them. My main point is that there must be sorting out process at the end of the year when the accounts are drawn up to determine clearly what is a loan and what a payment. That may not be possible until the accountant has done his job. The measures seek, therefore to simplify the procedure's operation.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked whether subsequent loans could be made in the time that is allowed for repayment of the loan and suggested that that might lead to further avoidance. I hope that I understood his point correctly; he is right to suggest a proposition of his own invention. The accountant and/or the company, however, sort out the loans and payments at the end of the account period. A tax charge is incurred during the period of the loan and can be extinguished by a repayment within nine months of the accounting period having closed. The hon. Gentleman did not take full note of the fact that we are dealing with the period after the end of an accounting period. If more loans could be made in the nine months, we would, by definition, move into a new accounting period. We are, therefore, not dealing with an avoidance scam, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a point on behalf of the Law Society, which has suggested to the Government that no charge should arise if the loan is repaid before the tax falls due. Legislation that creates a contingent charge is, however, impractical. It would be better to introduce a charge and allow a claim for relief, which would ensure that the provision worked for partial repayments of the loan. The Law Society's simple amendment would, however, not deal with partial repayments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) asked about a possible loophole with regard to PAYE. In that respect, there can be a charge on the individual. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central rightly said, the granting of loans, which are deemed to be distributions to the company's directors, results in the liability to advanced corporation tax. If the loans have a beneficial element, however, those people who run the company could, in their own right, clearly face a further tax liability in terms of benefit in kind. I hope that that deals with the point of the hon. Member for Dudley, West—I am glad that he is nodding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that the company makes a £10,000 loan to one of its participators in an accounting period—perhaps on 1 February—and that the loan is repaid four months later. The company will presumably have to report the loan to the Revenue. Is it the case that a tax charge will be made for the duration of that four-month loan unless it is subsequently repaid? Or is it the case that the Revenue would receive none of the money because it would repay it and that the company could invest or put to other uses the notional tax payable, which would subsequently be repayable? The Revenue would never get its hands on the money. Because of the longer period, there is much more time to decide whether the money is a loan and to utilise money that would otherwise be in the Revenue's hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman did not say when the accounting period ended. He simply picked 1 February out of the ether. If the circumstances that he described arose in the context of a continuing accounting period, the taxi meter of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
charge would start ticking, because there would be an outstanding loan. Until the company settled up, there would be an outstanding claim. I made that point in response to the Law Society. Part of the loan could be expunged, but there would still be an outstanding claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is to bring the method of settling those matters in line with corporation tax pay and file, which gives the company nine months after the end of the accounting period in which to settle its tax affairs. The Revenue's claim hangs like the sword of Damocles over the company, and it can be expunged if the loan is repaid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue that we are all concerned about and which the Minister mentioned almost in passing is that the company accountant will decide how to treat this money. Those of us who have had occasion to look at the accounts of partnerships or small companies never cease to be amazed at the inventiveness of accountants in this country. By the time the accounts have been prepared, some items have been turned into something different depending on the fiscal, economic and trading circumstances. There is obviously a risk that giving accountants nine months to come up with a more favourable version of events will lead to the creation of tax loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the Government want to rationalise the nine-month period and bring it into line with other aspects of the tax regime. We will not oppose the measure: only time will tell and I accept that 14 days is rather tight. It would be interesting to know whether the Revenue has ever insisted on 14 days, because I suspect that not everyone has met that amibitious target. However, I am concerned that we will enable the tax system to be used by participators in a closed company to avoid tax in a way that is not open to other people who do not have closed companies or who are caught by some other aspect of the tax regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the genuine concerns of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, but, with respect, he trespasses into potentially dangerous territory. Any firm of accountants employed to draw up accounts has an obligation to provide correctness. People employ accountants under the circumstances to ensure that the accounts are done correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue is experienced in dealing with anti-avoidance legislation. We did not seek to make fundamental changes to the law; merely to change the period in which outstanding loans can be settled without a charge to tax to the same period that is afforded to any incorporated company to settle its tax affairs. The hon. Gentleman's logic, taken to its extreme, implies that it is wrong to allow people nine months to sort out a company's accounts because they would have plenty of time to undertake all kinds of nefarious activities. I do not think that that is what he meant, and I shall not press him on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important point to reflect on is that the underlying avoidance legislation does not change as a result of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify two points. The measure will apply from 31 March 1996. Will the Minister confirm that if a company made a loan to a family member on 1 April 1995, because of the way in which the legislation is drawn that loan could be repaid before 31 December 1996 and no ACT would be payable? Is that how the clause will work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the real world. I appreciate the fact that this is an administrative measure and it does not affect legislation on beneficial loans, for example. However, it provides an opportunity to engage in tax planning and to massage the figures as the financial year ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the typical shoe box accounting system practised by many family-owned businesses, an area manager will often take money out of the company's finances during the year and instruct his accountant to minimise tax liability—who can blame him for that? However, under current legislation, if it were deemed that a company was tax efficient because of its healthy profits and if a portion of the moneys drawn during the year was in the form of a loan that would be repaid if the company did less well in the subsequent financial year, a tax liability would have crystallised within 14 days after the end of the financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most accountants will not have set about the appropriate tasks within such a period. A cash flow problem will have been created because the ACT would be payable in those circumstances. So we are now providing tax accountants with a greater period of time to regularise a company's affairs and thereby minimise tax liability. I have no objections to that, but it must be made clear that that is what we are doing—effectively making life easier for accountants preparing the accounts of small owner-managed businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be easier if I spoke now to save the Minister from having to rise again and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to develop a point arising from the Minister's comments and from the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West. The vast majority of people who control closed companies are scrupulously honest and stick to the rules. The vast majority of accountants do likewise. However, the concern that I want to express is also shared by the Revenue: we all know that some people in this world take actions that we wish they did not. Equally, accountants can take a different view about the interpretation of the same set of facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a lawyer and I know that, if asked, two lawyers will give a different interpretation of the same set of facts. If 57 lawyers are asked, multiply the interpretations accordingly. Quite ethically and properly, it is possible for different accountants to put a different interpretation on the same set of facts. The Revenue knows—as do accountants—that there may not be enough time or resources to establish the truth about loans or other transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to make too much of a song and dance about the issue, but it is important to recognise that
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
there are legitimate concerns here. I hope that the Minister will not treat me to a lecture—that this amounts to an attack on accountants and business—because we all know of worrying cases. I recall a man who ran a small business. He was a staunch Conservative and it always surprised me that all his transactions were conducted in cash produced literally from his back pocket. He used to plead that he traded at a loss, but the feel-good factor seemed to be alive and well in his household.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not painting a widespread picture of corruption, but we know that people sometimes behave unacceptably. We shall not oppose the clause, but the Minister should be wise to what can and does happen. If nothing else, I hope that the Revenue will note a desire expressed by Members on both sides of the Committee to keep an eye on abuses. If they develop, we may have to revisit the provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Gentleman's Conservative friend needed a good lawyer and probably found one in his private exchanges. No, I do not want to trespass into making accusations about what the hon. Gentleman said. I am grateful for his general support. As a man of experience where companies and their affairs are concerned, I take seriously what he said about potential abuse. No doubt members of the Revenue, who read our debates, will weigh his remarks carefully and take careful note.

The hon. Member for Dudley, West asked about tax planning. Section 419 of the Taxes Act 1988 ensures that when money is taken out and kept out, no tax advantage arises. He also asked a question about the timetable of the introduction of the measure, which is dealt with in the Revenue press release. If a company's accounting period runs from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1996, a loan that is made on 1 April 1995 can be repaid on 31 December 1996 with no tax charge and no interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would substitute a new version of clause 160(4) for the current version.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 160 amends section 13 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which allocates the gains of closely held non-resident companies. Clause 160 means that those gains will be allocated in proportion to the interests of participators in a company. A participator is a person who has a share or an interest in the capital or income of a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is complex but the Institute of Chartered Accountants was concerned about one aspect of it, with which my amendment would deal. Section 13(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 relieves gains from charge under section 13 where the gain is distributed within two years of being made. Clause 160(4) replaces that relief with a system whereby any capital gains tax that is charged on a person under section 13 is credited against future income or capital gains tax liabilities of the same person on a subsequent distribution by the Company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provisions provide no relief where either the original gain or the subsequent distribution is relieved in some other way—for example, by loss relief, reinvestment relief or double tax relief. They do not provide relief where the original gain or subsequent distribution is subject to corporation tax, or where the subsequent distribution is made to a person other than the person to whom the distribution is made. To avoid such difficulties, amendment No. 168 would provide that the subsequent distribution should be exempted from tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 13 of the 1992 Act provides that the relief for future distributions is available only if the distribution is made within two years. That is perfectly logical where the original gain is exempted from tax because otherwise, the taxpayer would obtain a considerable cash-flow advantage. For example, a gain made in 1996 by a non-resident company might otherwise be exempt from tax under section 13 if the company were liquidated 20 years later, but the liquidation proceeds would be taxable only at that later date. Where relief is given to the subsequent distribution, however it makes no sense at all to provide a time limit for the distribution. If it is proper to prevent double taxation where the gain is distributed within two years, why should double taxation arise if the gain is distributed within, say, four years? The amendment would deal with that difficulty by removing the two-year time limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several serious concerns have been raised about clause 160 by all the professional bodies, but it does not seem as though most have been taken on board by the Government, apart from in amendment No. 146, which is an extremely sensible measure. One wonders what the Government were up to in introducing the £500 de minimis limit in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has some serious defects. Although I appreciate the sentiments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield in drawing up his amendment, I am not
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
convinced that it deals with the problem of unrelieved tax losses as it needs to. As I understand it, subsection (5A) allows any tax paid as a result of an apportionment to be treated as extinguishing liability to tax if the gain is remitted within two years. But the subsection does not appear to offer any relief if the gain is offset by losses or any reliefs or if the gain or income arising on the remittance is itself offset by losses or other reliefs. That sounds like complicated gobbledygook. I think that it means that if, for example, an asset held by an offshore company appreciates by £1 million and the taxpayer has capital losses of £1 million elsewhere, the taxpayer has no true tax liability. However, when the gain is remitted, the taxpayer will have a chargeable gain of £1 million, but no reliefs or losses left to offset against it. I do not think that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield deals with that problem. The clause remains defective in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation raised several problems. To focus on one, if a gain is not remitted within two years, tax assessed under section 13 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 can be treated as a deduction in computing the chargeable gain on the shares in the offshore company. I do not think that that is exactly fair. For example, a gain of £1 million could arise and be taxed and the tax could amount to £400,000. Under the proposed legislation, as I understand it, the £400,000 is added to the base cost of the shares. However, that still leaves £600,000 to be taxed when the shareholder disposes of the shares in the offshore company—a further liability of £240,000. We appear to be building in potential double taxation as a result of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several other concerns. In particular, the Minister needs to take note of comments from the Chartered Institute of Taxation which said that the clause is on the
	<br><blockquote><p>"verge of being unworkable in terms of potential administrative complexity."</p></blockquote>
If I had the money and I wanted to invest in a friend's business in France—perhaps to give him a long-term loan to help to start up the business—I would have to assess several things when I compiled my tax return under self-assessment. I would have to assess whether the company is a closed company, what capital gains had been made as a result of the long-term loan to a friend—I might not know a great deal about how the business is run—and how that is treated under United Kingdom law. I would also have to calculate my share of the apportioned gain. People's ability to do that under self-assessment is likely to be extremely limited and that constitutes a major problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to put on record another comment from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which puts such things far better than I can. In a damning comment at 1.2.20, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 160 needs to be rethought. The revised proposals must target the avoidance which is to be attacked and introduce some form of motive test. Non-resident companies are too common and too important to be exposed to his kind of legislative treatment."</p></blockquote>
That comment is worth serious consideration and I should be grateful if the Minister would address it in his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that is another anti-avoidance measure, so we do not criticise it—although, predictably, there are protests from the industry when the Revenue tries to tighten up on avoidance. Some of those protests are justified: for example, on subsection 13(b), which talks about a just and reasonable apportionment. That term is always debatable—what is just and reasonable to the Revenue is not necessarily so to the taxpayer. There is an argument that the definition should be more precise. An article by Philip Shirley in this month's edition of the magazine Taxation, entitled "Finance Bill Folly", drew attention to the fact that uncertainty exists. As we ask taxpayers to do more, the desire for certainty in the tax system understandably increases. Can the Minister tell us whether a more precise formula in that and similar cases has been considered, although it clearly has not been in this Finance Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's amendment removes the £500 limit. Had he thought about having a limit of, say, £5,000 instead? If he has not, can he tell us whether the Revenue anticipates any tax loss? Five per cent. could be a substantial sum, depending on the size of the company. It would be interesting to know, from the experience of the Revenue, whether the measure will result in any tax loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government amendment. It makes an essential change, particularly with the advent of self-assessment, and means that people who might be deemed very small participators do not have such a problem with the legislation. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central made a point about the term "just and reasonable"; I too would like to hear the Financial Secretary's comments on that because it has caused problems in the past. It was a term used in the Capital Gains Taxes Act 1979, which had to be revised by the Inland Revenue after the case of Leedale 	<i>v</i> Lewis. I would also like to hear from the Financial Secretary about the decision to make the legislation apply to participators rather than shareholders. The hon. Member for Dudley, West gave an example of a problem that might arise from that. As the clause is drafted, it may be possible to attribute gains to participators who have no economic interest in capital gains. The hon. Gentleman cited the case of a loanholder: any holder of non-convertible loan capital might have a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the last point raised by my hon. Friend, the clause seeks to address that very issue. It has been possible for people to avoid the law as it was originally framed simply by not having a shareholding in an overseas venture—such ventures are largely created for avoidance purposes. People could effectively say that because they do not have a shareholding, they do not have a gain and so do not have an interest in capital gain. That was clearly a way of avoiding tax and we have laid down a different definition of "participator", which I shall address shortly, to get around that element of avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
My comments on the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield will draw his attention to the fact that, under the clause, in some cases a United Kingdom resident may pay tax on a gain and later receive a distribution of that gain; that could mean that he pays tax twice. The clause therefore gives tax relief on the gain against tax on the distribution made within two years when the same person is charged. The question of that period of two years was raised by Opposition Members. There is inevitably a rough and ready element in such measures. However, people become involved in these arrangements as an opportunity to invest overseas and avoid a liability to capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with sophisticated investors who know the anti-avoidance procedures and will also know of the time scale within which the provisions of the clause will operate. I have little sympathy with arguments in favour of a longer time scale, especially with reference to the type of investors relevant here. My hon. Friend's amendment would alter the circumstances so that when tax has been paid in respect of a gain and there is a later distribution, it will be exempt from tax. However, the amendment goes too far in addressing possible rough edges in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abandoning the two-year limit would be impossible to administer. It would be increasingly difficult to relate the gain to the subsequent distribution. The two-year period provides reasonable time within which a company can realise and distribute a gain and the taxpayer claim benefit for the relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would be open to exploitation. For example, the tax on a small distribution from an offshore trust of £10 in respect of a gain of £1 million could mean that no further tax was payable in respect of the subsequent distribution of £999,990. I fully accept that my hon. Friend does not intend that, but it could be the effect of his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is also worried about double taxation when gains are apportioned to trusts. I hope that I can write to my hon. Friend about that matter in greater detail to flesh out a complex area. Interaction with trusts depends on the nature of the trust and how it has been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said before, we are not dealing with an area into which innocent taxpayers stumble inadvertently. They do not set up non-resident trusts to invest in nonresident companies without being aware of what they are doing. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central rightly drew our attention to anti-avoidance. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg), that is what the clause is centrally about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to balance the need for fairness with the need to protect the Exchequer, and to do that as simply as possible. I have explained to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that the clause and the Government amendments deal precisely with that and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
that his amendment would have unintended effects. He also mentioned relief when gains are subject to corporation tax, and the problem of losses. Relief is available when the distribution is subject to corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a particular participator has losses available to set against the gains attributed under the clause, it might have the effect of extinguishing the liability of that year. There would then be no tax to credit against the tax liability of the subsequent year when the gain is distributed. It is contended that there is double taxation in these circumstances because the losses have been used up. However, that is an integral feature of all tax credit relief systems. For example, the crediting of foreign tax against UK tax is dependent upon there being sufficient UK tax. If a foreign gain is reduced by losses available in the UK, the credit for the foreign tax is lost. The principle is the same here. Given that we are dealing with nonresident companies under the control of a few persons, it is likely that the timing can be arranged so that such problems are minimised. Even if it were agreed that the point should be addressed, it is likely that a change would be complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West offered a critique of my hon. Friend's amendment and mentioned the two-year period. He concluded by asking how the interest on the money that someone had lent his friend in France would be determined under the new arrangements for a just and reasonable apportionment. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West also asked about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message that we have received from those who are affected by the proposal is that taxpayers do not like the alternative of a motive test, which would be subject to more uncertainty than the just and reasonable test. The reference to certainty in self-assessment was important because without certainty, taxpayers might have to make assumptions about how their actions will be viewed. In the case of a nonresident company, it is more difficult for the Revenue to gain information, and it would be easier for taxpayers to dress up their action in such a way as to suggest that they had a commercial purpose. In any case, the exemption for disposals of trading assets already gives relief in which a true commercial motive exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires attribution to be made according to the test of a just and reasonable basis, which is not unknown in tax law judgments. People may have differing arrangements depending on their overseas company. The hon. Member for Dudley, West spoke of a person who loaned somebody some money. Those parties would have to agree on how that person should be rewarded for the loan. It would, therefore, be easy to identify participation. When sophisticated investors put money into enterprises, they do so in a way that will enable them to receive some return on their investment. Therefore when we examine the relationship between the foreign enterprise and the individual participator and the way in which gains are apportioned, we shall find a clearly definable relationship and a basis for giving the reward. Disagreements and doubts can be settled by
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
the special commissioners, who can give independent arbitration. I hope that that deals with the point by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. The hon. Member for Dudley, West mentioned double taxation, and I hope that I dealt with that in my remarks to my hon. Friend. I also mentioned self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central spoke about Government amendment No. 146. He asked whether we had considered a figure greater than £500 and whether we should have a double lock on the apportionment of gains for non-resident companies. We tabled the amendment because we wanted to ensure that two approaches were open to us. The representations that we received noted that, given the complex way in which such companies are established, £500 would be a small amount. Innocent taxpayers with various arrangements may not know that such a small sum has been allocated to them in their role as participators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in response to that representation we decided to retain the 5 per cent. figure so as to include serious investors, to whom we want to apply the anti-avoidance provisions in order to get round the problem to which my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West referred. The straight answer to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central is that, having decided that there was no need for this de minimis amount in cash terms, we did not consider a higher figure because we felt that the 5 per cent. gain rule, which is retained by amendment No. 146, would be sufficient to involve or capture anyone covered by the substantive part of the clause. I have done my best to answer hon. Members' questions and to underscore the reasons why the Government's amendment is cast in such terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A clause such as this places members of a Standing Committee in great difficulty. On the one hand, we know that it is an anti-avoidance clause and none of us supports deliberate tax avoidance. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has listed four different techniques that were being used to avoid paying tax. On the other hand, it is described by the Chartered Institute of Taxation as unfair, giving rise to considerable scope for double tax or tax that can never be received. The hon. Member for Dudley, West criticised my amendment for not going far enough to deal with the concerns that have been expressed, but my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said that it went too far and would allow people to pay tax on £10 and avoid it on £999,990. It is difficult to make a judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no forewarning of the clause. That may have been because it is an anti-avoidance provision: if there had been forewarning, there may have been forestalling. But it was not announced in the Budget, so the first we knew of it was when it was published on 6 January. Even though the provision is backdated to Budget day, it was not covered by a press release on Budget day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just trying to understand the question of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may explain the intention of clause 161. Nothing in the long established anti-avoidance legislation for closed companies changes as a result of it. We want to clarify the application of that anti-avoidance legislation to those closed companies in the context of the establishment of new forms of exchange—where shares may be bought and sold—in addition to the official listing on the London stock exchange and on the unlisted securities market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause proposes that the companies that are listed on the official list or on the unlisted securities market will not be affected by the proposals, except in the case of closed companies that are controlled by five persons or fewer. That is the current situation. However, because of the less demanding requirements on companies that are listed on the alternative investment market and other exchanges, we seek to apply the anti-avoidance proposals to them. I would point out that other benefits—for example, the avoidance of capital gains tax—are available to companies that are quoted on AIM.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our intention that the measures should in any way discourage companies on AIM. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will know, if it can be shown that any of the practices that are subject to the anti-avoidance codes are done for legitimate commercial purposes, then, after proper application to the Revenue under the law as it currently stands—I note that the majority of such applications are agreed—such practices can be carried out legitimately and should not, therefore, be seen as an inhibiting factor to those various exchanges. I hope that that deals adequately with the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the clause is designed as an anti-avoidance measure on closed foreign company legislation. I want to make some general points on the clause and its schedule—I suspect that we shall deal with more specific points when we discuss schedule 32 in the next debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern about the clause comes from the Confederation of British Industry, which raised certain issues. I should be most grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister could respond to them. The CBI is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
concerned that the whole subject of legislation and taxation of controlled foreign companies—the closed foreign company legislation—is under review. I understand that a consultation document on CFCs was issued and that it invited comments by 29 March 1996. The time for comments has, therefore, not yet expired. There is a considerable worry that the legislation on closed foreign companies is very complex already and that the clause and schedule will increase its complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the result of the consultation exercise, there is a likelihood—indeed, given the nature of such matters, a probability—that additional legislation will be required in the future, possibly in the next Finance Bill. Therefore, my first question is whether it would be more sensible to wait for the results of the consultation, which covers the same issues as the clause and schedule, before introducing the legislation and to introduce any required legislative tax changes in one fell swoop—possibly in next year's Finance Bill. I understand from the figures given in the Red Book that the revenue consequences of the schedule and clause are minimal. Consequently, I presume that the risks of waiting on legislation would not be very great for the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second concern is that I understand that the clause and schedule are specifically directed at captive insurance companies, which is where most abuse is believed to occur. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister could confirm that that is indeed the case. If it is, I should point out that the schedule is very widely drawn and would encompass all controlled foreign companies, including those that are genuine trading companies. It would put a substantial increased tax burden on genuine trading companies that are also CFCs and would put them at a disadvantage against their locally registered competition in the foreign markets in which they apply. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend could examine whether the legislation is drawn sufficiently tightly to exclude genuine trading companies and catch only those companies where abuses occur. If the legislation is aimed at captive insurance companies, could not it be specifically drafted so that it attacks captive insurance companies and excludes all other controlled foreign companies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is to inquire whether any assessment has been made of the compliance burden that the schedule and clause impose on companies. There is a suspicion that the compliance burden might be quite substantial and that before introducing such complex legislation, it would be better to make some assessment of the compliance costs so that the balance of benefit could be assessed. That ties in with my original point that there is a case for delaying the legislation until the consultation exercise is completed and has been evaluated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point is that the distribution made under the schedule and clause for tax purposes from controlled foreign corporations must be done according to United Kingdom accounting principles. That is fine in principle, but many other accounting regimes are equally valid. Is it not sensible to extend
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
the flexibility of CFCs to any internationally acceptable accounting regime?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the size of the contribution required from CFCs to be paid back to the UK, group provisions need to be incorporated. Will my hon. Friend confirm that it is his intention to allow group relief on such distributions? The group relief requirements for this level of distribution could have a significant impact on the financial viability of many companies' overseas operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have come to an odd stage in our proceedings when the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) is urging Ministers to abandon, or at least modify, a provision in the Bill. I support the Government. Indeed, I congratulate them on the clause and on schedule 32, which are about closing tax loopholes highlighted by the shadow Chancellor in his paper on tax abuses at the time of the Budget of November 1994. I hope that the Minister will have the courtesy to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) as I pay tribute to the Minister and his Treasury colleagues for seriously considering sensible Opposition proposals to clamp down on tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with one point made by the hon. Member for Fulham. He said that the Red Book establishes that the income generated by the proposal would be minimal. The tables in the Red Book suggest that in the next couple of years the revenue gained by the Exchequer would be small, but that is because of the delay in the accounting period for controlled foreign companies. One year's delay in implementing the clause would prolong the period before the Exchequer started to reap the benefits of closing the tax loophole. The Red Book establishes that the benefits in a full year amount to a considerable £100 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a mistake for the Government to bow to pressure from the Back Benches, the CBI, the Chartered Institute of Taxation or the Law Society, all of which have vested interests in having clients who would benefit from the preservation of the tax-avoidance opportunity for a longer period. Both sides of the Committee should recognise that it is in the national interest that the Treasury plugs tax loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of questions for the Minister. In the past, the Treasury has been unable to estimate the cost to the Exchequer of offshore tax havens. With respect to this provision, however, it has been estimated that the revenue gained by the Exchequer in a full tax year after the change bites will be f100 million. Will the Minister explain how that estimate was made and whether the Government are any closer to estimating the total value of tax avoided by individuals and companies in offshore tax havens. I also urge the Minister to be bold enough to continue with the policy line advocated in the clause when he has received responses to the consultation document on controlled foreign companies, which was issued at the time of the Budget. One of the principal ideas canvassed in that consultation document is the abolition of the acceptable distribution policy loophole that allows companies to avoid taxation on gains made on funds
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
lodged abroad. That is right and I urge the Government not to be deflected from their course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister help the Committee by giving us an estimate of the total value of sterling assets held offshore? According to a survey of the external positions of banks prepared by the Bank for International Settlements in May last year, the value equivalent of liabilities of banks in the Cayman Islands was $425 billion; that is more than the external liabilities of France and more than double those of Germany. As more money goes offshore, the world money supply stops being lodged in developed countries—the industrialised countries in the north of the globe—but goes offshore. An article by Sylvia Courtnage in the journal 	<i>Money Management,</i> which came out at the time of the shadow Chancellor's plea for action to close tax loopholes, said that 60 per cent. of the world money supply is now held offshore. Members on both sides of the Committee regard control of the money supply as an important economic lever that is available to our Chancellor of the Exchequer and to Finance Ministers in other industrialised countries. As more of the world's money supply ceases to be under the economic or tax jurisdiction of such Ministers, the ability to use that economic level is devalued. Could the Minister help me by estimating the value of sterling assets held offshore?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham for his interest in the matter. The Committee is unanimous that there should be proper anti-avoidance provision on offshore companies. My hon. Friend invited us to consider whether we should postpone all the proposals in the clause relating to schedule 32 until after the consultation period has ended. The consultation document that was issued on Budget day, which proposed reforms to the controlled foreign companies tax regime, addressed the question of how we bring the complex area into the context of self-assessment for companies. At present, there is no return or notification requirement on companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that if we are to talk about how to bring something into the context of self-assessment, it might be possible to look at the whole issue and consider whether we can wrap it up in some grand tour de table of the affairs and bring it back in the form of a revised piece of law. However, I draw attention to paragraph 4 of the Revenue press release that was published when the measure was first announced during the Budget. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal is expected to increase Exchequer yield by £100 million."</p></blockquote>
My view is that with such revenue at stake, we cannot afford to wait too long before we take action to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we seek to apply to a certain type of enterprise the provisions that already exist for other types of enterprise that we deem to be conducting
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
their affairs in such a way as to avoid paying their proper dues? Why do they have a tax regime under which they have effectively to remit 90 per cent. of their profits? Why is the test of the application of UK accounting principles applied when computing those profits? QED, why do we want to apply that test to the class of companies to which my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham referred? I shall talk about that in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain of those companies are already required to remit 50 per cent. of the profit that they make in their overseas location, where the determination of that profit is based on local accounting practices. One of the reasons for the proposed change is it has become evident to us that a number of companies are exploiting the flexibility of the local, non-UK element of accounting practice to depress their profits while maintaining their balances. They are stuffing their coffers with money in the tax haven, but, by using local accountancy principles—for example, for dealing with liabilities, which is a particular reference to the captive insurance company that my hon. Friend mentioned—they can depress their profitability and thus reduce the amount of profit that they have to send back to the UK. If they did not do that, they would be taxed as part of the group concerned, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham will understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have observed such behaviour since the last change was made to the relevant legislation in 1994. It is not just a question of captive insurance companies. For example, people might set up an invoicing operation in a tax haven so that the invoice comes from the tax haven and the money goes out there; the same local accounting procedures could also be used in that way. The transfers of trade marks is another such area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham dwelt on the subject of captive insurance companies so I shall settle on that for a minute. I want to make the important distinction between what I call good activities—genuine trading enterprises, which are not caught by the provisions—and those that are not so good and which are the subject of the provisions. That distinction addresses one of my hon. Friend's concerns and representations that we have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a UK retailer, for instance, had third-party claims for warranties in connection with the goods that he was selling, and had set up an insurance company in the so-called tax haven where that business was conducted, that would be an example of legitimate trading activity, because he was dealing with a third party. It would not, therefore, be caught by the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if he set up a captive insurance company to insure intra-company risk—in other words, if he set up a self-insured captive company to deal with his potential liability to, say, an environmental claim—he would have created an opportunity, using the type of manipulative activity which employs local accounting principles in the context of potential insurance liabilities, to hide away taxable profit. Hence, we want to deal with such situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
We have received inquiries from certain taxpayers—I use those terms because the Revenue is clearly right to deal with them anonymously. Taxpayers in a legitimate trade—perhaps they have set up an overseas company to do business, gain market share and battle on equal terms with their overseas competitors—are not generally caught by the provisions. Those who have sought comfort have generally found it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham asked about companies' compliance under the measures. Trading companies that are affected by the Bill will face increased compliance costs because their profits will have to be calculated as if they were taxable under United Kingdom law so that we can calculate how much dividend they must pay to satisfy the exclusion. Such companies currently have alternative ways of dealing with that. We are, however, talking about no more than 500 companies, almost all of which will be trading subsidiaries of UK multinationals. The people who are involved are relatively sophisticated and know what they are doing. Our business is to protect the Revenue in the ways that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked whether we could use another accounting regime. The purpose of using the UK accounting provision is to stop people using other regimes that give them the benefit that we seek to end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Cayman islands. I do not suggest that its accounting practices should be accepted, worthy though they are. A company may, however, use United States standard accounting practices, which are perfectly legitimate and internationally accepted. Would not it be possible to allow a little flexibility if a company, for internal purposes, uses United States, rather than United Kingdom, accounting standards for its captive subsidiary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would depend on what the company does. A company that was trading in the United States approached us, and we told it that the provision did not apply to it because its trade was legitimate. Provisions already exist for a certain class of tax-avoiding company, which require remittance of the 90 per cent. of profit that is back-calculated on United Kingdom terms. We want to apply that law to a further class of enterprise. I do not want to give my hon. Friend the impression that we could be flexible on
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
that. We want to apply a measure that is familiar in the corporate world to a new class of company, which is exploiting the loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned application of group relief on distribution. Any dividends that are paid by overseas companies that satisfy the remit distribution test will have income against which group relief can be set in the usual way under existing rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York encouraged the Government to continue its support for the proposals. He asked me why it is that in this context we can make an accurate estimate, whereas in other areas of avoidance we cannot always answer direct questions. It is important to reflect on the fact that under the present arrangements such companies are required to produce a remittance for 50 per cent. of their profits. Based on that, we can estimate the figure that could be saved under the proposals in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe I have dealt with the terms and nature of the consultation document to which my hon. Friend referred. Obviously, the Government keep the operation of any part of the tax code under close review. I have no doubt that its application to self-assessment will throw up other issues. We are robust in our view that we should proceed with this measure so as to protect the £100 million of revenue to which I referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most interested in the figure of £100 million. Has the estimate of the tax that will be saved by these avoidance and evasion measures been increased? The Red Book shows that the measures against avoidance and evasion will save £60 million next year. Has a further estimate been made since the Red Book was published that has put the figure up to a higher level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I should have been more precise. The Revenue's press release said that the full effect of this measure would be felt in 1999 and 2000. We want to make it clear that this process will be implemented, because the longer we postpone it, the longer we postpone the benefits of dealing with tax avoidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification. That emphasises the point that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West made. The tax benefits of this measure will, in time, be substantial, and we all support my hon. Friend's efforts to plug this loophole. However, while I accept that the scope of the consultation document is broader than these anti-avoidance provisions, I believe that there is likely to be an overlap between the legislative changes as a result of the consultation document and the legislative changes that we are now discussing. A delay of one year to get it right would have a minimal revenue effect. I urge my hon. Friend to think hard about whether implementing the clause now is the most sensible way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can draw a detail to my hon. Friend's attention. The reason for the longer time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
frame for the full effect of this measure to bite is that the dividends affected will not have to be paid back to the United Kingdom until 18 months after the end of the controlled foreign company's accounting period. If we are to deal with the problem, we must take action this far out because of the knock-on. effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can usually tell whether it is a fair cop—to use common parlance—by the amount of noise coming from those affected. It is fair to say that the concerns expressed to us have not been about the principle involved but about the practice, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham said. That is why I took seriously his remarks about the representations from the CBI. The noises off show that people appreciate that benefits can be gained from acting in this area. Some people have even wondered why it has taken us so long. We are careful about the way we act, and we are sure of our footing on this matter. To postpone action any longer would be a dereliction of our duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York asked about the estimate of sterling assets held offshore. I cannot give him any comfort on that point. His question was in a narrow business context, but there are all kinds of assets held by all kinds of people in all kinds of situations. Even if the hon. Gentleman were to submit a parliamentary question, it might be beyond the bounds of reasonable cost to give an accurate answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point about what happens if all that money is mobilised, but by and large assets held by UK companies exist for wholly legitimate trading purposes and I do not think that we should see a sudden disruption of monetary policy if all that money moved. In the real world, that is not why people invest in assets abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt thoroughly with my hon. Friend's comments and given clear reasons why we wish to proceed, but I assure him that I will look carefully at the practical points that arise from the consultation document and bear them in mind as we seek to apply the legislation in the context of self-assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There has been some concern that the definition of "interest" would involve any person, no matter how small his interest in the controlled foreign company.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause takes us to the subject of inheritance tax, a major part of the Bill. On 13 July last year, the Prime Minister said in answer to a question at Prime Minister's questions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When it is appropriate and when we can afford to do so, I wish to abolish both capital gains tax and inheritance tax."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 July 1995; Vol. 263, c. 1087.]</p></blockquote>
We are concerned by the Government's raising of the threshold at which that tax becomes payable. Can the Financial Secretary tell us whether that is part of the process of moving towards the Prime Minister's commitment to abolish inheritance tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways to approach such a change. One is that it is a recognition of a long-standing problem which has been getting worse because house prices were allowed to get out of hand towards the end of the 1980s. Also, several inheritances now fall within the tax bracket so that tax becomes payable, which was not the original intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other approach is that the change is part of the process of moving towards the Prime Minister's commitment on inheritance tax. If that is the case, it shows how the Government perceive their priorities. Patients are on trolleys in hospitals because there are insufficient beds and in my county of Warwickshire the police are underfunded by £6 million and have had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
to lose up to 172 officers this year. Local government services are massively overstretched and care in the community and other services are under enormous pressure. The poor often sleep in the streets and many poor people have a great deal of difficulty making ends meet. Our society is under a series of strains as a result of the economic failures of the Government, yet the Prime Minister's priority seems to be to abolish inheritance tax to benefit a small number of millionaires who pay the vast majority of that tax. That says something about the Government's priorities and a great deal about how they perceive society and the interests that they seek to represent in that society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister claims that inheritance tax is somehow a drag on enterprise. Few would agree with him, even 	<i>The Economist,</i> in which an article was published on 22 July 1995 about the Prime Minister's proposals. 	<i>The Economist</i> is not a magazine to which one would readily ascribe even a pinkish tinge, but the article said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed it is hard to make a convincing case for abolishing either tax"—</p></blockquote>
capital gains tax or inheritance tax—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on economic or political grounds."</p></blockquote>
The article went on to warn the Government that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"might lose votes by strengthening the belief that the government is unfairly biased towards the wealthy"</p></blockquote>
and that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Certainly if some redistribution of wealth from rich to poor is desirable, death is the most economically efficient time to do it.,'</p></blockquote>
In its pamphlet, "Death: the Unfinished Business", published in November 1988, the Institute for Fiscal Studies wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Today's very rich have mainly become wealthy by inheritance. This is at odds with the notion of wealth as a reward for effort … Everyone in a democratic society expects to have an equal chance of maximising their potential, regardless of their background. Thus the existence of unequal opportunities deriving from accidents of birth makes for social friction and disharmony."</p></blockquote>
If the Government are moving towards abolishing inheritance tax altogether and the clause represents a step in that direction, their intention must be to create unequal opportunities in our society, deriving from accidents of birth. They are conscious—they must be aware—of the social implications and the damage that that can do to society.

Labour wants to create wealth. We might argue that a Labour Government will create more millionaires than Mrs. Thatcher, but we want those millionaires to pay their fair share of taxes. That difference between fair and unfair tax is the key difference between the two main political parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would expand on his phrase, "we want those millionaires to pay their fair share of taxes." Will he define what he means by "fair"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely that a Minister in the present Government would not know what fair means. The concept is entirely beyond the Government. We know from the way in which they behave towards those who are deprived, the health service and those who are in any way in need that they have no concept of fairness. I could explain at great length the failures of the Government and range far wide on the inadequacies and unfairness that they have created in our society, but I suspect that you would call me to order, Mr. Hill. I shall concentrate on the matter before us—inheritance tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The priorities of the various parties are shown in what they believe is important. The Government believe that people who pay inheritance tax—especially those who pay a lot of inheritance tax because they are particularly wealthy—should pay less. Very few people would gain from the abolition of inheritance tax because the exemptions and reliefs mean that the vast majority of estates are not subject to the tax. On average, more than 600,000 estates are transferred each year and in 1991–92—the last year for which I have figures—only about 16,500 paid tax. I suspect that the figure will have increased since then because of the way in which estates have continued to move during the past few years, but less than 5 per cent. of estates would gain if inheritance tax were abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1991–92, only £231 million was collected from estates valued at less than £300,000. The vast majority of the revenue comes from Britain's richest estates. As with the proposed abolition of capital gains tax, a small elite would be subsidised at the expense of the hard-pressed majority. Again, the Conservative party is speaking for the vested interests of the wealthy and those who want to keep their wealth at the expense of others and not contribute properly and fairly to society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 22 July 1995 	<i>The Economist</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Half the benefit of ending inheritance tax would go to the heirs of the 2,000 biggest estates."</p></blockquote>
The Inland Revenue's statistics for 1995 state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each year the top 5,000 estates will gain over £800 million. An average of at least f 160,000 each."</p></blockquote>
The figures that I have make it difficult to give the precise number of those who would be taken out of inheritance tax under the proposal, but it is likely to be a few thousand. If inheritance tax were abolished, a greater number would benefit, especially the very rich. In 1994, the top 10 wills were worth £179 million. Those 10 estates would have gained up to £72 million. In the analysis by 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> one third of the richest 500 were on the list because they had inherited wealth. How many will it be if inheritance tax is abolished? Analysis of 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> richest 500 shows that if inheritance tax is abolished, Graham Kirkham's estate, worth £233 million, stands to gain up to £93 million; Lord Rothschild's estate, worth £160 million, stands to gain up to £64 million; Sir Phil Harris's estate, worth £99 million, stands to gain up to £40 million; John Whittacker's estate, worth £95 million, stands to gain up to £36 million; Paul Judge's estate, worth £30 million, stands to gain up to £12

The hon. Gentleman is being a little naive. Does he not realise that the estates to which he refers can purchase sophisticated legal advice so that they will, almost certainly, not pay such sums in inheritance tax? They may not even pay any significant sums in inheritance tax because they will have used the seven-year rule or trusts to avoid tax legally. The people who are really caught by inheritance tax are those with modest amounts of wealth—someone whose house is worth more than £200,000 and who has some savings—who are not so sophisticated and who are unable to purchase expensive and complicated legal advice, or who leave this world suddenly and unexpectedly and cannot benefit from the seven-year rule. The hon. Gentleman makes a case based on moral or social, rather than economic, considerations, the effect of which is perverse because it means that the tax is something of a lottery and the people who draw the unfortunate lots are those with whose position he would usually sympathise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The points made by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding will provoke sympathy throughout the country.

The inheritance tax is a different creature from capital transfer tax. It is a creature of the Government, who have created the circumstances in which the concerns of the hon.

He must reply to the issue raised by his hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding that the tax has become a lottery under his Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make Labour's position clear to the Financial Secretary. We would not join the Prime Minister in regarding the abolition of capital gains tax and inheritance tax as any sort of priority given the scale of problems in our society. I can make that clear answer to the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He described inheritance tax as the creature of the Government. Can we take it that a Labour Government will bring back capital transfer tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government changed capital transfer tax substantially during the 1980s and created, although we are talking about the value transfer to the chargeable transfer, something that is not the sort of tax that previously existed. The Government therefore have to take responsibility for the failures of that tax, which the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding has outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has put a question to the hon. Gentleman but has not received a response. Let me try again. If by some terrible misfortune the Labour party were to get into power, would the hon. Gentleman abolish the seven-year rule and the various reliefs under inheritance tax for business assets and agricultural assets? Would the hon. Gentleman make the burden more savage? If so, he would do great economic damage because he would be diluting wealth, transferring it to the Government's coffers and turning capital into current spending. That would deter people from accumulating wealth because people often do that much more for their children than for their own benefit. The hon. Gentleman would drive capital out of the country and those people who make substantial amounts of money would have a great inducement to make money and keep it outside the country. The hon. Gentleman would do economic damage if he went along the path that he is now proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman answer the specific point? It is all very well to say that it is a lottery, but would the hon. Gentleman address the shortcomings of
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
inheritance tax by abolishing the seven-year rule and other reliefs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman, who made a forceful plea for fairness in taxation a moment ago, should now be concerned about what he termed as deterring people from accumulating wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear that the Labour party wants business to succeed and that we want to create more millionaires than Margaret Thatcher did. However, we also want to ensure that taxation is fair. The hon. Gentleman earlier said that he wanted fair taxation. Given the eloquent way in which he stated his case, and given his vote last night, I wonder whether he soon may be joining us on the Opposition Benches as two of his former hon. Friends recently did. The hon. Gentleman would be most welcome on the Opposition Benches because he is a man of integrity, other members of the Committee may make any other contrasts that they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister's pledge to abolish inheritance tax is at odds with his previously stated desire to create a classless society. I know that some say that the right hon. Gentleman came up with the phrase "classless society" when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer just because he was contesting the leadership election with someone who had been to Eton and wanted to suggest that that person was not suitable to run modern Britain. I know that journalists have suggested that that was the Prime Minister's intention, but I have tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. If he meant what he said about creating a classless society, how can he, in all honesty, and with integrity, advocate such a society after making the case for the preservation of inherited wealth on the scale that he seems to have done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such proposals are a further sign of the Conservative party's lurch to the right. Abolition of inheritance tax would benefit a privileged few, but do nothing to create an enterprise economy. Genuine family businesses are already exempt from inheritance tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to dealing with the question of privilege, will my hon. Friend consider a problem that has always bothered me? The abolition of inheritance tax would increase rigidity and stratification as more and more people would hang on to their money—that could be private or business capital—to the last possible moment instead of seeing it fructify by transferring it to children or by making early use of it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
in a wider business sense. Abolition of inheritance tax would create a new generation of misers who would hang on to their money for as long as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes that point eloquently and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Succinctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Labour party's view, inheritance tax must operate fairly without penalising those who do not have access to sophisticated tax planning advice. During the debate, Conservative Members, including the Financial Secretary, have expressed concern that we might in some way hurt the interests of those who have access to sophisticated planning advice. Again, I say that the difference between Opposition and Conservative Members is that we are concerned with those who do not have that access or the money to pay for that sophisticated planning advice, and they are most concerned to ensure that those who have such access are given continued privileges so that they can avoid the tax that the Government created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abuse of the conditional exemption scheme, which was originally intended to safeguard art collections and family farm land, should be looked at again. The Labour party would introduce arrangements to prevent bona fide family businesses and farms from being broken up. We want the tax to work fairly and effectively, but we do not want to hamper the way in which the economy properly functions. The Labour party wants an inheritance tax system that does not penalise those on middle incomes, but ensures that millionaires pay their fair share of taxes. Raising the inheritance tax threshold and tackling abuse can be desirable reforms. Abolishing the tax will hand millions of pounds to multi-millionaires. That is not how the Government should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the proposed change in the clause is meant merely to acknowledge the way in which inheritances have risen, and if the original intentions of Parliament were not to catch those who have been caught by the tax because of recent changes in the value of estates and have had an unintended liability imposed on them, there is something to be said for the proposal and it may be desirable to increase the inheritance tax threshold. If, however, the Government seek to abolish inheritance tax, we say to them that they have the wrong sense of priorities. They are seeking to benefit a small minority at the expense of a vast majority and to give privileges to those who already have the privilege of wealth, and thereby deny the rest of society access to fair taxation and the services on which many in our society depend. That would be wrong, and we would oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly anxious that it has taken so long for the clause to be introduced because I have looked at the history of inheritance tax. [Interruption.] Conservative Members may scoff, but their record in recent years has not been good. In April 1992, the threshold for inheritance tax stood at £150,000. It was then frozen for two years. In April 1994, it was uprated with inflation to £154,000. That does not show dynamism on the part of Conservative Members who scoffed. I have tried to work the figures through. If the threshold had again been uprated with inflation, I calculate—perhaps the Financial Secretary will confirm this—that it would have risen to £160,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with the representation made to the Chancellor in 1994 by the Country Landowners Association, which said:

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Financial Secretary would confirm that, had the threshold risen with inflation, the figure would have stood at £160,000, but that, instead, it has been raised above the rate of inflation, to £200,000. Will he confirm that cost, as the exercise is a costly one? According to the Red Book it leads to a loss of income in the subsequent financial year of £130 million, rising, in 1998–99, to £295 million. That is a significant loss. The rising threshold leads me to conclude that the Prime Minister's desire to abolish inheritance tax is spreading in the Treasury. I should like to know more about the direction in which the Financial Secretary's opinion is moving. Has he been listening to the expressions of the Prime Minister's desire for the abolition of inheritance tax? That has been put on the record many times.

On 1 July 1995 the Prime Minister was reported in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would like to make an early movement on inheritance tax … I would like to all but abolish inheritance tax for the majority of citizenry."</p></blockquote>
Across the road at the Queen Elizabeth II centre, later in July, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We should set our sights on capital and inheritance taxes which act as a drag on enterprise. My aim is to see those taxes reduced and if possible abolished altogether."</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"to abolish both capital gains tax and inheritance tax."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 July 1995: Vol. 263, c. 1085.]</p></blockquote>
The list of occasions goes on. He said to the party faithful at the conference in October—and I like this bit—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must get taxes down again … I mean inheritance tax"—</p></blockquote>
well, he must have meant something; the other taxes have not come down—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I mean capital gains tax. We must cut them, and then—when affordable—we should abolish them."</p></blockquote>
I am keen to see whether the clause is part of a movement in that direction. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will tell us in what direction he is moving. As I understand matters, the cost of abolition would be immense. Will the Financial Secretary confirm the figure of £1.6 billion in a parliamentary written answer—a sum that is equivalent to a penny off income tax? There is a stark choice. Does the Financial Secretary want to follow the route chosen by the Prime Minister, and abolish inheritance tax for, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire said, a very few people—or would he like all people to gain from a reduction in income tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not here when I began. I said that for everyone's benefit I support the clause. I welcome it. For the avoidance of doubt, I am in favour of it. My hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire has provided many figures to show how few people would gain from cutting inheritance tax as opposed to income tax.

I am pleased that the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding began a discussion about avoidance. My hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire spoke of the problems that arise from conditional exemption from inheritance tax. I want briefly to talk about some avoidance that takes place. As the Committee, and, in particular, the Financial Secretary, will know, it is possible for landowners to avoid inheritance tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
