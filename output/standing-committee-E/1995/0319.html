	<p>[MR. JAMES HILL 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service (Residual Liabilities) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health (Mr. John Horam)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the National Health Service (Residual Liabilities) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. Hill, to the Chair of this Committee on our modest Bill. I understand that you have recently completed the proceedings on the Finance Bill, which must have been rather more indigestible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Bill may be a reward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is, Mr. Hill, and that we can serve up a modest dessert to follow your long main course on the Finance Bill. I am sure that my hon. Friends wish that to be the case and that the Opposition also feel that a modest dessert would be in order for you and your co-Chairman, Mr. O'Hara, whom we also welcome. I am sure that we shall make progress under your Chairmanship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also offer my thanks and hope that the dessert does not take too long, Mr. Hill, as you have sat through the proceedings on the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister has brought forward the proceedings in Committee so quickly. When I first came into the House of Commons, it was normal for there to be two weeks between the Second Reading and consideration in Committee. That procedure has been greatly truncated in recent weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion proposes that we sit both on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. I have had discussions with my hon. Friends and, although I do not know what the Minister's diary contains, many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have events in their diaries to which they have been committed for a long time. Clearly, sitting on two days a week will interfere with those commitments. The Minister might reconsider and agree that, in the circumstances, the Committee might sit on Tuesday mornings only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Bill is modest, but we think it an interesting one. It does not stand on its own; statutory instruments that might be affected by the Bill are on the Order Paper almost daily. Indeed, there were two such instruments yesterday. We should like to consider the Bill in the context of other legislation that is being introduced into Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, I believe that it would be better if we sat on Tuesday mornings only until we are able to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
reorganise our diaries or until we ascertain whether we need to sit for a long period, as sittings motion suggests, to consider a Bill that the Minister seems not to deem important. Perhaps the Minister will give us his views on the suggestion that we should sit only on Tuesday mornings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had been under the impression given by the Labour party—that Opposition Members attached almost as much importance to the national health service as we do. I am surprised that Opposition Members' diary appointments are more important than the NHS. That is not the position among Conservative Members. We will break every diary commitment to be here to discuss the Bill because we attach great importance to it and do not in any way treat it lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a wish to organise the sittings differently, I am prepared to listen to what is said. If talks are held through the usual channels during the morning, we could reorganise the sittings. If my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), the Government Whip, feels, after discussions, that progress can be made, I am not determined that we will sit on Thursday mornings as well as on Tuesdays. I must insist however, that the sittings motion is passed, until other arrangements can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays and am happy to discuss the national health service and the big issues which relate to it and to the Bill. I have no objections in principle to that, but I want to know, like my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) why there is such a rush to push the Bill through. Why do the Government consider it necessary to sit on two days each week? If we cannot make progress, is it likely that we shall sit in the afternoons? That would bear even more on our diary commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be an element of rush. Members who know me from my years in the House of Commons are aware that I have a suspicious mind. There must be something behind the Government's rush. The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to take over a trust's liabilities when it goes broke. No trusts have gone broke, but a number are in considerable debt, which makes me wonder whether the Minister knows something that we do not. Are some trusts in such dire financial straits that they will be forced into mergers with other trusts, or are some not in a position to take advantage of the private finance initiative because they cannot give guarantees to the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend had the opportunity to read reports over the weekend that a number of trusts might be technically insolvent? Is that influencing the Government's rush to get the Bill on to the statute book? Will my hon. Friend comment on that with particular reference to sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. That is the point that I am making. I did not see those reports and am pleased that my hon. Friend drew my attention to them. I will take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
a look at them. It has been known for a long time that a number of trusts are in severe financial difficulties. They have some strange accounting methods, having what are called statutory accounts, which the Government say they should produce for public disclosure, and management accounts, which show what is more likely to be the real position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My district health authority's statutory accounts show that it is roughly in balance and that everything is rosy, but its management accounts show that it is £8 million in the red. It is similar with trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on the timing of our consideration of the Bill and the haste of the Minister, who said that he needs the Bill rapidly. Has that anything to do with the changes that are taking place on 31 March? I am sure that my hon. Friend's local trust will be merging with a family health authority in Leeds. A number of such mergers are taking place and they will be affected by the Bill. Is that why the Bill is being considered at such speed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point, because it is clearly relevant. Those mergers will show—this is causing concern among health authority officials throughout the country—that the health authorities and the trusts that they monitor are in severe debt—indeed, in much more debt than suggested by the statutory accounts that are published for public display. I suspect that the Government want to push the Bill through with great haste because they want to cover up the true picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Members, our job is to seek out information and to put it into the public arena so that the public can see the financial state of public services and how they are run. Officials and Ministers responsible for institutions such as the national health service should be properly accountable. Therefore, it is right that we should have the true picture of the debts faced by trusts and health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members regularly say on the Floor of the House that they speak for business and for the private sector. I doubt whether that was true of their approach to the Asylum and Immigration Bill, in which the Government imposed a burden on small businesses. Those businesses will have to act as immigration police, but I am straying from the Bill by discussing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this instance, I want to speak for private business. It has a right to information about the debts of health authorities and trusts. Before private business decides whether to invest in capital projects, it must have such information. It is no good selling the private sector a pig in the poke by asking it to invest money without it having the proper information. One of the Opposition's fears, however, is that the private sector will end up owning national health service hospitals and turning them into private hospitals. No doubt, we shall discuss that later in our proceedings. Nevertheless, private businesses have the right to know that the trusts with which they will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
deal will not go broke as a result of severe debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not concerned about sitting on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. I would be quite happy to do that. Although the Bill is limited in its scope, we might have the opportunity to discuss many of the issues relating to the NHS and to debate private finance initiatives. I am worried, however, by what is being covered up or is potentially being covered up, and that clearly involves the problem of debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we agree to the sittings motion, I hope that the Minister will give us some idea of the true level of debt faced by the trusts. By that, I mean not the debt detailed in the statutory accounts—that is only one guide—but the debts revealed in the management accounts. As I said, in my health authority there is a difference of £8 million between the two sets of accounts. The private sector has as much right as the public sector to know the true picture. I hope that the Minister will provide information that will help to guide our debates on this important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stephen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important and exciting Bill. It is full of fascinating points of detail that are the very stuff of which Committee work in the House of Commons is made. I cannot wait to get on with our deliberations. Let us sit, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and, if necessary, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Little did I realise when I finished the 26th sitting of the Finance Bill that I would be renewing your acquaintance, Mr. Hill, quite so soon. It is an absolute delight to serve under your wise Chairmanship again. I hope that you will forgive me if I occasionally stray and discuss VAT anti-avoidance provisions or loan relationships. I am sure that you will quickly put me back on tract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly concerned about the rush in which the Government seem to want to deal with the Bill. The Minister spoke of the Bill's importance—and it is important—and the need to clear entries in diaries. I understand that. However, one of my reasons for being interested in serving on the Committee is that it is proposed in my constituency to build a £60 million extension to Russells Hall hospital, just outside Dudley. That would mean the closure of Wordsley hospital, which is in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been bitterly fighting the plan and have made a pledge to my constituents, 30,000 of whom have signed a petition against the closure of Wordsley, that I will fight the closure tooth and nail. I have a series of meetings arranged for Thursday morning, with a range of organisations that are much opposed to the closure of the hospital and to the building at Russells Hall hospital being undertaken with private finance under the current regime. I stress that that opposition applies under the current regime, because the Opposition believe that private finance has a role to play in public sector infrastructure projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Warren Hawksley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halesowen and Stourbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee that he does not have the support, in his fight for Wordsley hospital, of his right hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, East (Dr. Gilbert), and that the proposed closure has the support of the two community health councils that are involved? That is interesting and perhaps it is the reason for the hon. Gentleman's thinking that he must continue to press the point. No one else in the neighbourhood is carrying on the fight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. It would be helpful to the Committee if I were to explain, at some length, the background to his remarks. As I understand it, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, East is not convinced by the proposals to centralise services at Russells Hall. I believe that he is unhappy about plans that have been drawn up under a Tory-run national health service regime, which places the dogma of privatisation, rather than private finance, to the fore. He sees, however, that the proposal would not affect his patch. As a diligent Member, one of his main concerns is to fight his corner. At the moment it seems that his patch would do all right from the proposal, though services would be transferred from the Guest hospital in his constituency to Russells Hall
My near neighbour, the hon. Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge (Mr. Hawksley)—in whose constituency I happen to live, making him my Member of Parliament—spoke about the decision of the community health council. The Committee will be interested to know that the CHC decided, on a knife-edge vote that relied on the casting vote from the chair, in favour of proposals entitled option 3, which would mean the bulldozing of Wordsley hospital. The maternity unit at that hospital was opened only seven years ago. Both my young daughters were born there and it provides exemplary service to the community. It was built at a cost of £7.5 million. Money is still being spent on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order: This sounds like the hon. Member's major speech, to be delivered later in the progress of the Bill. Perhaps the hon. Member would return to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. I assure you that it is not my major speech, which is likely to be far more significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge asked why the CHC voted for the option 3 proposals I shall outline those proposals and the reason for the knife-edge result of the vote. In Dudley, an incompetent health authority has been given the run-around by a more streetwise NHS trust. The trust has used scare tactics to frighten CHC members into voting for the proposal to initiate private finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is all very interesting, and may explain why the hon. Member cannot attend the Committee on a Thursday morning, but he seems to be describing all the problems that exist in his area.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
If he will draw his remarks to a conclusion, we can come to a decision on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. I am more than happy to draw my remarks to a conclusion. I hope that the hon. Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge will recognise that I have given him as full an answer as I can in the circumstances and within the Committee's terms of reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return specifically to the sittings motion. I have already explained that I will have problems attending the Committee on Thursday. What is the rush—why all this haste? I am reminded of a few words from Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet". If I remember it correctly, Juliet, when pressed by her suitor, says that she has no joy in this contract tonight—it is too rash, too ill-advised and too sudden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look what happened to her. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My concern is what might happen to the Bill if we rush it through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must ignore that chit-chat as much as he can. If he wishes me to protect him, he should say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. I feel in no need of protection, in this respect at least. I do not wish to stray into other issues of protection, given talk about Romeo and Juliet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good point has been made about whether the rush to pass the Bill is being driven by problems in NHS trusts or health authorities which we do not know about. We shall return to that point time and again during consideration of the Bill in Committee. What justification does the Minister have for rushing the Bill through so quickly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a strong preference for delaying the Bill's passage as long as possible because I should like to delay the NHS trust plans in my constituency, which I think will damage local health care. With your indulgence, Mr. Hill, I might in future seek the leave of the Committee to read out the names of the 30,000 or so people who signed the petition against the closure of Wordsley hospital and against the building, using private finance, of a major extension of Russells Hall hospital. However, the Committee may not welcome my doing so with open arms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important Bill, and unless it contains sufficient safeguards for the public, we should consider delaying its passage. I may return to that point in future sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity, Mr. Hill, that you could not agree to my hon. Friend reading out those names. We could have arranged for him to do so on Thursday, which might have resulted in a different sittings motion that would have delayed the Bill on a different basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask—and be given honest answers to the question—why the Bill is so urgent. On Second
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
Reading, it became clear that, although rapidity was required, the Secretary of State was reluctant to say why that was. The Secretary of State opened the debate by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The question before the House this afternoon is extremely simple—whether the national health service should pay its debts"</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no one outside this House will agree that the NHS should be free to walk away from its debts"</p></blockquote>
I suspect that nobody inside the House would agree that the NHS should be free to do so; but that is not the issue. When we consider the issues that are involved, we shall see that they require careful examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When introducing the Bill, the Secretary of State was pressed to explain why the Bill had been introduced at that particular time. He told the House:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have introduced the Bill because approximately three months ago it was pointed out to me that there is a weakness in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990—".</p></blockquote>
He then went on to spell out what that weakness was by saying that the Act
	<br><blockquote><p>"contains the following provision:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If an NHS trust is dissolved under this part of this Schedule, the Secretary of State may be order transfer—".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State made clear that it was "may" that was critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State spent three months producing a Bill to get rid of "may" and replace it, in effect, with "must". Yet we are expected to deal with the Bill in three sittings spread over a week and a half. That haste is unnecessary: if the Secretary of State, with his array of officials took three months, it is surely reasonable that the Committee should explore the issue in some depth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will have some effect in the constituencies of most hon. Members. On Second Reading, I frequently referred to St. James's hospital. I am not unhappy with the developments there. We are likely to discuss some schemes and use them to illustrate the principles behind the Bill, so I have to say that I do not entirely understand how the St. James's hospital scheme fits in with the Leeds review of health services. The review seems to be reaching conclusions that relate to how community services might be helped by not necessarily basing them at St. James's hospital. Such detailed points will have to be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members often have constituency contacts in specific trusts and health authorities. I met the intended chairman of Leeds health authority—which I suppose can still be referred to as Leeds healthcare—in the period between Second Reading and today. As a result of meeting him, I have reached the conclusion that, although I welcome the extension of community services that will result from the changes, there might be other means of meeting that need, which should be explored at the same time. That emphasises that we should exercise care and ensure that we get everything exactly right; show why, in practical terms, there may be some specific value for the St. James's trust in a little delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us back to why the Government want to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
introduce the Bill so urgently. The Secretary of State made it clear that people did not believe that he would not meet his liabilities; they merely wanted to see firmly in writing that he had an obligation to do so and that he could not wriggle out of it. Although he said that he would not wriggle out of it, he may have thought that others on the Government Benches might be less circumspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was reluctant to tell us who was pressing for the changes. He said that shortcomings were pointed out to him three months ago, but he would not be pushed on who pointed those out. Eventually he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was the people with whom we are negotiating about the private finance initiative."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 March 1996; Vol. 273, c.808–12.]</p></blockquote>
He made it clear that the people involved on the other side of the table, whose signatures would also need to appear on a contract, wanted to ensure that the Secretary of State did not have a way in law for not adding his signature and for not making it clear that, in the last resort, he would have that responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that it was not the banks that wanted the change, but the people with whom he was negotiating. It becomes clear by reading on that although the banks are not necessarily the signatories, they are and have to be behind any such scheme. Considerable money has to be available and there must be some certainty that it will be forthcoming if a scheme does not go as envisaged at the moment of signing. The Secretary of State was reluctant to say who pointed out the shortcomings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a good point. He is adding to my initial remarks about the rush to introduce the Bill and my concern that perhaps we are not getting the full information. Although there might not yet be signed contracts, he is implying that agreements, perhaps with banks, are already in place, which is why the Bill is being rushed through. In those circumstances, the agreements will have a great deal of detail, including how much public money will be put in to help pump prime private finance and how much banks or private finance institutions will receive in return. There may be getting a cheap rate. For example, rail privatization—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is an intervention, but not a short one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend implying that agreements could be in place already between the Department and the private finance institutions? If so, does he think that the Committee has the right to know the full details?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Secretary of State made it clear that agreements are in place. Indeed, a press release of Monday 29 January—the Minister is well aware of its details—referred to such arrangements. The Secretary of State has said that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
has given 23 projects the go-ahead recently, although it has become clear that the go-ahead was not exactly the go-ahead; it was the amber light as opposed to the green light. It asked people what they wanted to do and what agreement they had reached. The press release makes it clear that the agreement in this case
	<br><blockquote><p>"follows two years' detailed negotiations by St. James's and the private sector."</p></blockquote>
It also tells us what the private sector is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the selected private consortium, Medipark (St. James's Leeds) Ltd, which is 50 per cent. owned by Mediparks Ltd and includes Charterhouse Bank and John Laing Construction."</p></blockquote>
It also clarifies what the public sector side of the contract is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The entire development, including… Medipark and car park, will be built on the 13.5 acres of land adjacent to the hospital which was acquired by St. James's from Leeds City Council."</p></blockquote>
So, because the trust was unable to contribute money, it contributed property—13.5 acres near the city centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained, I played a minor part in ensuring that negotiations took place between Leeds city council and St. James's in order to provide that land. A car park is desperately needed at the hospital and will benefit all sorts of people, provided—I received no assurance from the Minister on Second Reading—that people can afford to park there for varying lengths of time. Sometimes, people go to hospital not knowing exactly how long they will be there. Some visits are short and some long, so we need a flexible system. I am sure that that can be provided if the matter is dealt with sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is, in the detail of the Bill, what is guaranteed under liabilities and what is not. I am unclear how the Bill would affect that site, where different things are happening. There is a car park and a building. Under the contract, the land will initially go to the private sector but, after 25 years, it will revert to the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is incredibly interesting; I can assume only that the hon. Gentleman would like more or longer sittings than have been proposed. But I should be grateful if he would return to the sittings motion and say why he cannot attend on Tuesdays or Thursdays, or advance any other argument against the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. As it happens, I would have some difficulty attending on Thursdays, but my point is one of principle. The Committee should explore the details of the Bill properly. That would be helpful especially to Members in whose constituencies the PFI is active, although the Minister looks forward to a time when it will be active in everyone's constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be pleased to see something active in my constituency of Morley and Leeds, South or, in future, Morley and Rothwell because, as the Minister may know, all health facilities are built in one side of the city in Leeds. In the past, nothing like that ever came
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
south of the river. The prevailing wind ensured that all the industrial smoke went south, so all those people who could afford to went north.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is that a reason for not sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it does not affect Tuesdays and Thursdays in particular, Mr. Hill, but applies to every day of the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know how such matters as I have mentioned will be affected. Although people are reluctant to say so, it appears that to get signatures on the contract to enable work to start, the Secretary of State needs to strengthen his obligations. He was not absolutely clear about that on Second Reading. He said that it was necessary to go ahead, and the impression was given that that was all that mattered. If all that mattered was to go ahead in accordance with the announcement, we would not, I am sure the Minister would agree, be sitting here now. The Bill must be passed if the green light is to be given. That is the reason for the haste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need to examine details, to ask the reason for haste, and to press for careful exploration of certain issues. The details need to be explored more steadily, although I do not say that we necessarily need to spend more time in Committee. A Labour commitment exists in relation to PFI for public-private partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the sittings motion, surely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The conditions under which we believe proposals should go ahead are clearly laid down. We want to ensure that the proposed legislation would fulfil our conditions as well as the rather looser conditions with which the Minister might be happy. I support the case that my hon. Friends have made for sittings to take place at a different rate than is now envisaged. I note that discussions have taken place through the usual channels, and no doubt that process will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen), who spoke early in this short debate, is the last person whom I should accuse of having a suspicious mind. He is the most honest and open of Members. I have always had excellent dealings with him. I hope that my saying so will not blight his career. I hope also that he feels the same about me. I have been perfectly straightforward. We have had interesting debates about methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in hospitals in his area—a serious problem. There is no reason for him or anyone to feel that something is being covered up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Members for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) and for Morley and Leeds, South talked about the management of hospital trusts as though that might form a pretext for the Bill. That is not so. Trusts are in a healthier condition than they have been since they were set up in their present form. The Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in the report to which the hon. Member for Dudley, West referred that the national health service accounts, as a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
whole, were entirely unqualified. That is probably the first time that has happened since the trusts were established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to a different report, prepared by Trust Monitor, C4 Consulting of 11 Waterside lane, Sydling, Dorchester, to which I should like to refer later this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman referred to that report, but he will understand that the comptroller and Auditor General is the proper authority to examine the trusts' finances. He acts on behalf of Parliament. He is entirely independent. His word counts for a great deal—as opposed to the word of an independent organisation of which I have never heard. I should be interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman will say about that organisation, but we have the requisite parliamentary authority to say that the performance of the trusts is better than it ever has been. Their performance has been excellent, so the Bill has not been introduced for the reasons that the Opposition have suggested. Not only have the accounts of the NHS as a whole been unqualified, but no individual trust or health authority has had its accounts qualified either. Those are the facts as reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Let us put the matter into context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Comptroller and Auditor General raised one or two concerns about the management and so forth of individual trusts. I fully accept that. However, there are more than 400 trusts, so it is inevitable that one or two will face difficulties from time to time. Those problems are being dealt with in the usual way. There is no particular difficulty there. The Bill is not being rushed through because of the position of the trusts. That is not the case. The Government and I are not concealing anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's picture of the finances of trusts is at odds with my perception and knowledge of the health authority in my constituency. Trusts are facing considerable debts and they are coping with them bravely. They are being forced to make cuts and to enter into agreements with other trusts to rationalise services. However, the driving force is debt. The Minister is responsible for these issues. Is he seriously telling the Committee that the trusts have told him that their financial position is rosy? Perhaps, the Minister is disguising the true position and the fact that some trusts face serious debts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have endeavoured to keep my remarks to the sittings motion, Mr. Hill.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Comptroller and Auditor General about NHS trusts. The Comptroller and Auditor General is part of an outside and independent body that is the right parliamentary source for information on the financial position of the trusts. He gave them a clean bill of health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept that in one or two areas and in one or two trusts—the hon. Gentleman's area may be among them—there are particular concerns because of the need to improve health services and because of cost constraints. Those problems are being dealt with in the normal way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to give way again because Mr. Hill has made it plain that he wishes us to move on. However, I shall comment on what the hon. Gentleman said previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West raised some interesting, but worrying points about the position in his area. I hope that he will not be allowed to read out 30,000 names in Committee. If he were to do so, we would be here for ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that names such as Mickey Mouse appeared on the petition. would it be in order to read those names out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not, but it is not my job to decide whether Mickey Mouse is in order. I think the hon. Member for Dudley, West would concede—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I object strongly to the debasement of the efforts of my constituents. About 30,000 of them signed the petition. One or two names may have been put down in jest, but I do not know whether that was so. If the Committee wants me to read out the names, I shall point out which names are valid, with proper names and addresses attached. The Committee will then realise that many—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order for the Chair. The number of Mickeys Mouse on the petition is not a matter for me. We must move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that you, Mr. Hill, will take that into account if the hon. Member for Dudley, West or any of his hon. Friends raises matters concerned with the reconfiguration of hospital services in their area. This is a simple Bill about the liabilities of trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman, because I have commented on what he had to say. He has had a full answer. No doubt, he will talk to me at another time in another place should he want to raise concerns about Dudley. I also heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge said and we have placed it in context. For example, it is the case that the community health council does not agree with the hon. Gentleman and has sanctioned the changes which he described. He should take up his complaints with another authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South said at length that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not fully explain the need for the Bill on Second Reading. I thought that my right hon. Friend made it perfectly plain why he wanted the Bill; indeed, the hon. Gentleman quoted him. The quotations from my right hon. Friend's speech were excellent and to the point. They made it clear why we need the Bill, and I do not go back on that in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Curiously enough, the constituency of hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South is a beneficiary of what we are trying to do under the PFI. His area—he mentioned St. James's hospital—is being helped by the PFI. Indeed, right across Britain the PFI is bringing together the design, the construction and the financial expertise of the private sector and the high quality care for which the NHS is famous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first time, the PFI offers real hope of an end to the traditional queue for the taxpayer's limited resources for capital finance from the Treasury. Already, a steady flow of PFI projects are coming forward in response to the demand for new and better facilities from which to deliver health care. St. James's hospital is in the forefront of these new developments. There are now no fewer than 25 schemes which, like that in the hon. Gentleman's area, are worth more than £25 million and are in the process of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each of the schemes represents new hope to communities which often have been long denied improved hospital facilities. My hon. Friends, many of whom have had to accept long delays in local hospital building, want the Bill and the PFI to go forward, but, despite that, shadow spokesmen tabled on Second Reading their reasoned opposition to the building of more hospitals. Indeed, the hon. Member for Dudley, West said that he wanted to stop the Bill, never mind the sittings motion in Committee. Just for the sake of Dudley and one particular local problem, he would stop the hospital building programme across the country. That shows the perspective of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South is even more amazing, because the area that he represents will benefit from the Bill. He wants a different sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stick to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to the sittings motion, and have just mentioned it once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
It is clear that we are building and improving hospitals throughout the country with the help of private finance and that the Opposition are obstructing the process and the hopes of people that there will be hospital improvement in their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. Mr. Hill has made it plain that he wants to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have placed themselves in an untenable position. I hope that my hon. Friends will make it plain in the local press that the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats showed that they were against hospital building by opposing the Bill on Second Reading. I hope that they will think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion does not represent any undue rush. We are not meeting in the afternoons. It is quite conventional to meet on Tuesday and Thursday mornings—there is nothing rushed about that. We are taking our time and ensuring that there is proper consideration of the Bill. I hope that the Committee will agree that we should consider it at a reasonable and sedate pace. There will be no rush, but proper consideration as we have set out in the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to go along with the sittings motion—I think that I still will—and say that, in the circumstances, we shall co-operate now that we have had discussions through the usual channels and have a good understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tempts me with his final comments. No one could read into the situation that we oppose all PFIs or the building of hospitals. In fact, he drew attention to what we oppose when he talked about the chance and hope of new hospitals. We do not think that decisions on the NHS, and on new hospitals in particular, should be left to chance. We do not think that decisions on the national health service, and on new hospitals in particular, should be left to chance. People should be beneficiaries of the NHS as they have been for many years. Such matters should not be left to chance or hope, as the Government are doing through the private finance initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been rushed through the House. Eventually we got the Government to tell us on Second Reading what the Bill will do. It will underwrite any liabilities of the private sector when it has contracts with the national health service. We have always believed that the NHS should honour its debts and contracts. We have always been sceptical because, instead of Ministers coming to the Dispatch Box and telling us what the Bill will do, we have had to get the information out of them—as we did on Second Reading last Tuesday. I hope that the Committee can probe further into the provisions of the Bill and its implications for the health service, not only in my hon. Friends' constituencies but throughout Britain. We can then find out how the Bill will assist in overcoming problems that are due primarily—certainly in capital

If the Minister thinks that I understand the Bill as it relates to the private finance initiative, he knows that I did not say that I do not want the scheme to go ahead. He ought to be honest about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will ask one last, technical question about an aspect of the Bill, with which the Minister has not dealt. In interventions on the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton, there was talk about the mergers on 31 March. The Bill does not apply or is not relevant to such mergers and no one is worried about that aspect. Is that because such mergers occur between two organisations that are part of the NHS and remain so and, therefore, the Bill is of significance only when contracts are signed with bodies that are not part of the NHS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is, I hope, clear to the Committee. In what is effectively a one-clause Bill, we want to probe the meaning of the phrase "ceases to exist" as it is used in clause 1. The Oxford English dictionary defines to cease as

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
How will one of the three types of body referred to in the Bill come to an end if it does so without being dissolved by the Secretary of State? I hope that the Minister will explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current wording is vague and open to misinterpretation. The clause could open the floodgates to legal action in the event of it ever being implemented. The Committee would be neglecting its duty to Parliament if it allowed the clause's wording to remain unamended, or if no detailed explanation of the meaning of "ceases to exist" was provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not claim to have a solution to the problems that I shall outline, but the amendment at least offers a stronger form of wording that suggests that the Secretary of State is in charge of the national health service. Such a concept was not challenged in the NHS between 1948 and 1990, when the fragmentation of the service took place. It does not seem so much that Ministers are in charge of the NHS any more. In the past week—even after the debate—it has been suggested that Ministers are not in charge of some areas of the NHS, where they were previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several ways to tighten the meaning of the clause, As it stands, the scope of the Bill is not properly defined. Since drafting the amendment, I have thought of another way better to define the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would start to transfer liabilities. I imagine that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will come up with their own solutions. I did not seek to table that other amendment. I hope that if the Minister accepts the thrust of our argument, he will accept the need to bring forward a form of wording for the Committee to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic argument for replacing the existing wording is simple: The phrase "ceases to exist" is meaningless in the face of our ever-changing health service. The past five years of reforms have meant a constant climate of health care revision. The fragmentation of services has been the hallmark of those reforms. With the divisions that have been brought into health care have come the division of property and assets, which the Bill covers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes measures for dealing with the transfer of such property and assets in the case of the dissolution or abolition of a trust or authority. Some trusts have already been dissolved by the Secretary of State—various health authorities are being abolished or merged, with more changes coming into effect at the end of the month. The Committee would appreciate the Minister detailing the actions taken by his Department in these cases. Why has the so-called problem of the transfer of liabilities not occurred before? We have seen many transfers—they have gone through the House under the statutory instrument procedure. They have been through the Treasury, debts have been resettled, yet the problem of transfer of liabilities has not occurred before. Is that because none of the trusts has made any progress regarding the private finance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
initiative? Is this just about PFI? I am sure that the Minister will want to address these questions, as they are integral to the purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will also want to turn his attention to the Bill's consequences, which have the scope to be severe. Making a comparison between a list of NHS bodies that existed five years ago and those that exist today would be extremely difficult, as would a comparison of their functions. Staff profiles in authorities and trusts have altered radically and not, in certain circumstances, for the better. I might refer later to the report by the now defunct Yorkshire regional health authority' which highlighted how Ministers have not really been in control of the changes in regional health authorities, even though everyone thinks that Ministers are accountable to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health service bodies today are vastly different from those that were originally planned and established. The history of the past few years is difficult to trace. In many cases, tracing the line of accountability for decisions made by trusts and authorities is equally difficult. The mass of executive letters, guidance notes and instances of ministerial interference has not made the process of determining the originators of decisions any easier. Anyone looking at the health service can see that it is almost collapsing as a result of change fatigue. No one in the public arena has any idea what has been happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tracing the full extent to which liability falls on individual parts of a health service body that has been dissolved or abolished by the Secretary of State is even more problematic. I am concerned by the phrase "ceases to exist". Does it really tell us what has happened to a health service body? If the Oxford dictionary definition is correct, it will be for the courts to decide when a body ceases to exist. For example, seven trusts were recently dissolved by the Secretary of State, but four of those merged to form two new organisations. Most people would say that the original bodies have not gone away. Most of the buildings remain, with people working in them who worked there before, yet the trusts are said to have gone. It is easy to argue that the trusts have not ceased to exist in anything other than name, but it is equally easy to argue that the merged trusts have ceased to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key appears to be where the organisations' assets or liabilities have gone, but determining even that is not simple. Various trust properties of different sorts seem to be permanently on the move within the national health service. The Library of the House of Commons is littered with statutory instruments drawn up for the purpose of transferring trust property. The Library computer alone lists more than 400 statutory instruments relating to such transfers within the past five years. I dread to think what the position will be in five years' time, if that fragmentation continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each of those statutory instruments moves assets between health service bodies. Does that mean that liabilities should be moved as a result? No one seems
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
to know. My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Broadgreen (Mrs. Kennedy) asked a parliamentary question about the merger of two trusts on Merseyside. That merger appeared, at the outset, to impose on the new trust the debts of the two old trusts—a total of more that £21 million. My hon. Friend tabled parliamentary questions about that, and bells rang in the Treasury. My hon. Friend told me that when she contacted the new trust, its representatives were unsure as to the level of debt, or what ground rules applied. My hon. Friend is concerned about the trust's debt, some of which has to be repaid to the Treasury on an annual basis, depending on the account in which it is held. That affects the service that people receive from their local trust. We must try to clear up that issue. The Minister will probably tell us that the Bill makes the position clearer, but it does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed changes to the Secretary of State's duties not only leave the transfer of property and liabilities in a state of instability, but may have a more widely disruptive effect. We can foresee chaos reigning in the NHS if a case in respect of property and liabilities belonging to trusts and health authorities were to come to court after a law had been passed containing the words "ceases to exist". Lawyers could pick that phrase apart in minutes. They could say that a health service body ceases to exist at the moment at which any change is made to its base assets and liabilities. A trust lawyer could argue that it exists in the form created. It has a balance of assets and liabilities, and it has originated capital debt, giving interest-bearing loans and public dividend capital. Any change made to that balance by the Secretary of State alters the corporate entity. The old health service body ceases to exist at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament should be clear what the phrase "ceases to exist" means if we are to pass the Bill unamended. The Minister and his Department will have taken legal advice on that. Hopefully, he will be able to tell us the circumstances in which the phrase "ceases to exist" can be challenged in a court and what the defence might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 400-odd changes to allocations of trust properties alone could undermine any actions planned by the Secretary of State. In addition, statutory instruments have defined the burdens of originated capital debt every year since the reforms began. Since the Secretary of State began to dissolve trusts, he has also been in the process of altering public dividend capital and interest-bearing debts. By changing the basis on which the Government establish trusts and health authorities, the Secretary of State is laying himself open to a legal fleecing if he crosses a litigious or aggrieved contractor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone predicts that litigation is the future of the national health service. When the new Bill to set up a complaints procedure was quickly taken through Committee, we did not discuss in any great detail litigation in the health service, but all the reports relating to that make it clear that litigation will probably be the future of the health service. Under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
those circumstances, we have to ensure that we are doing the right thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known and generally accepted that the main purpose of the Bill is to bail out the PFI in the health service. The wording of clause 1 lays the taxpayer open to not only the £5 billion of unauthorised and unaccounted borrowing, which we hope to address in later amendments, but an unknown potential legal cost if the Secretary of State tries to implement certain measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the duty of Parliament to secure the best possible legal framework, and it is our duty as legislators to attempt to secure laws that allow for the majority of likelihoods. Unless the clause is amended, it will fail to live up to the requirements of those duties. This is the second time this session that I have been in a Committee opposite the Minister and I would like to predict what he will say when he responds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been making key points about potential litigation and the cost of that to the NHS, and the relevance of the phrase "ceases to exist". If a trust goes through the process of ceasing to exist, the Secretary of State, in discharging the duty of taking over the transfer of property rights and liabilities, might leave the same managers—perhaps the same accountants—in place to facilitate that. Does my hon. Friend believe that trust will have ceased to exist, or will litigation arise because people will see the same managers in place and decide that the trust has not gone? Is that when the potential problem of litigation will occur?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I am not a lawyer and do not profess to know the law but, like the majority of hon. Members—who are also not lawyers—I have to take advice on the drafting of Bills. In certain circumstances, I am not even a friend of lawyers. Most of us who deal with law one way or another know who comes out winning. No matter who wins the case, lawyers usually come off best financially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not pass legislation that is unclear and challengeable. I am sure that trust lawyers would ask, "When does something cease to exist?". My instinct is that it should cease to exist when it is dissolved by the Secretary of State. That would make it clear. It would then be a matter for the House and not just for the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press my hon. Friend on that point because I see a potential litigation trap. Does he agree that to ensure that the trust ceases to exist, the Secretary of State will have to sack all the managers? Otherwise, one interpretation could be that the trust has not ceased to exist. In addition, the clause states that the Secretary of State must transfer the liabilities of the body to secure that all liabilities are dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is meant to be an intervention. The hon. Gentleman is delaying his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is absolutely right to pursue the matter and, in particular, to pursue it with the Minister—who, through his Department, has taken legal advice on all those matters and will presumably be able to answer our questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my prediction of the Minister's response. He is likely to say that the amendment is technically deficient—his usual phrase. He said that about every one of our amendments during a previous Committee. Then, he offered no reasons to support his assertions. I hope that if he contends that the amendment is deficient in some way, this time he will fully explain how it is lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier that amendment No. 1 is a probing amendment. We are not trying to damage or detract from the Bill—we want to improve it. We are in favour of a more coherent and applicable definition of the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may use the powers that he proposed to take. The phrase "ceases to exist" does not provide the clarity and assurance that the Secretary of State informed us would calm the nerves of jittery private financiers as a result of the Bill. i hope that the Minister will either accept the amendment or consider rewording the phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer but an Oxford Dictionary definition, according to which a trust ceases to exist when it comes to an end, is totally unsatisfactory. The end envisaged by any trust, whether it is an amalgamation or anything else, is vital to the question of public health. Although we may believe that some of the changes in public health that have taken place over the years, certainly since 1990, have been to the public good, big question marks hang over legislation such as this because its meaning is unclear. Our constituents will want to know how their local trust ceases to exist, and it will be unsatisfactory if it comes to an end as a result of litigation. I await the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although this is only a probing amendment, there are several points to probe. My hon. Friend laid great emphasis on the meaning of "ceases to exist" in relation to a national health service trust, health authority or special health authority. We need to know how it is envisaged that those bodies could cease to exist. Under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, they can be abolished by the Secretary of State. Of course, he does not have to pick up the liabilities under that Act. Under the Bill, the liabilities will be picked up—and presumably the Secretary of State will decide who picks them up. He may do so himself, at considerable public expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
When you opened the debate, Mr. Hill, you referred to the money resolution. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is expedient to authorise the payment out of money provided by Parliament of any increases attributable to that Act"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the sums payable out of money so provided under any other enactment."</p></blockquote>
But it does not say how much. There is no indication of what the money resolution will mean to taxpayers. We have a right to know. Surely the Treasury would have asked—if it was doing its job properly—how much of a burden that commitment could be for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are always encumbered by what is called the internal workings of Government—in other words, what Ministers tell each other they need not tell anyone else. In the context of the Bill, it is legitimate to ask how much public money will be involved and what is the worst option. I hope that the Minister will respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend laid great emphasis on the phrase "ceases to exist". How many ways does the Minister think that there are for a trust or health authority to cease to exist? I can think of three. The first concerns direct action by the Secretary of State. He already has that power under the 1990 Act. The auditors could say that the managers of a trust or health authority had behaved badly. For example, they could have run up large debts, they could be so unpopular that the public have little faith in them, and they could have acted ultra vires—certainly beyond the pale. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State could take direct action to wind up such a trust or health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such action might not be taken simply because trusts or authorities behave badly in running down the national health service. Their managers may argue that because of all the cutbacks and pressures, the service has got too bad to be true. Although they want to save the services in their community, they are out of line with Government spending policy. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State could take direct action and wind them up. That would be a bad step. I would not approve of giving the Secretary of State powers to wind up a trust or health authority when its managers simply wanted to save the public that they serve from disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Conservative conference after Conservative conference, I have heard speakers say that decisions on such matters are best taken locally rather than by the Secretary of State. A trust or health authority knows the local situation. Even if it meant stepping out of line with the Government's spending commitments, it would do its best for its area. In those circumstances, it would not be right for the Minister to step in and close down the trust or authority. However, that is one way by which a Minister's action could mean that an authority would cease to exist. I hope that the Minister will say how he proposes to use his wide powers and whether there are any limitations on their use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
The second way that an authority may cease to exist is through merger. I am not convinced by the Minister's earlier remarks. I know that the hon. Gentleman is genuine, and I am grateful for the frank points he made in our debate on MRSA. I hope that he allayed many of the public's fears. He deals with all issues that way. However, he may have been less than clear about the debts facing health authorities. I do not blame him for that, because two accounting standards are used. The statutory accounts, to which I referred earlier, invariably suggest that a health authority or trust is doing all right. I do not blame civil servants, either. They would point to those accounts when a Minister is questioned about a certain authority or trust, and say, "Look at its statutory accounts. They are all right." Ministers and civil servants refer to those accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The management accounts, however, reveal a different picture. In my health authority, there is an £8 million difference between the statutory and management accounts. That huge amount could make the difference between the survival or otherwise of that health authority, or it could force it into merger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point that amazes me and requires further explanation. Is my hon. Friend saying that the statutory accounts of that authority show a different figure at the end of the financial year from that in the management accounts for the same accounting period? If my hon. Friend is saying that, what is the reason for the discrepancy? The accounts should be the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are certainly not the same. I have taken the issue up with my health authority for the past two years. Two years ago, the difference between the accounts was about £7 million. This year, it has gone up to £8 million. I do not have all the papers with me, but with your indulgence, Mr. Hill, I shall explain the issue further at a future sitting, if I have the opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Peculiar accounting procedures are involved. For example, loans—and we all know that they are debts that must be paid back—are regarded as income under the statutory accounts procedure. That creates strange distortions of the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Minister's earlier assurances, some trusts and authorities experience severe debt problems. That is especially so in inner cities, in which health demands are considerable. There is great pressure on the health service and, at times, it complains of the great upsurge in the demands placed upon it. That upsurge must have budgetary effects and distort the calculations. That will create problems and act as an incentive for trusts to merge and perhaps, in future, for health authorities to merge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was significant that, in his figures, the Minister referred to the Audit Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General but not to the information that his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
Department has. I suspect that would present a different picture, unless the Minister is saying that he relies only on statutory accounts. If that is the case, I urge him to shake up his Department, because he will not be given the true picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that, from time to time, the Minister sits down with trust and health authority chairmen. I know that they want to keep their posts and maintain that they are managing well, but I bet that they sometimes tell the Minister that there are problems and that more money is needed. The Minister should look at the arrangements in his Department, to ensure that he is clear about the debt problem. That problem will drive the trusts towards mergers. When there are such mergers, the two trusts concerned will cease to exist. That is the second way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third way is the spectre of bankruptcy—the prospect of trusts going broke. That could happen because of mismanagement, when the trust does not budget properly, runs into financial trouble over time and is unable to meets it commitments. The problem of litigation adds to that prospect. There is an increasing tendency for people who feel that they have been badly treated by the NHS to take legal action against it. That is commonplace in the United States and also occurs in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my mail, I receive a huge number of complaints about treatment. The number has shot up. Some cases are extremely serious. People have talked to me about the death or near-death of loved ones, and people left waiting on trolleys for hours and their condition deteriorated as a result. Mistakes have been made. A woman came to my constituency surgery last Friday and said that because of a mistake in an operation, she had a hole in her bladder that was not spotted. She suffered enormous humiliation. She could not get the incontinence pads that she needed as a result of that mistake. The authority did not even recognise the error. Hers is just one of the cases that are heading towards litigation against the health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, when I see people in my surgery, I think that they are right to proceed with litigation, but that places an enormous burden on the health authority or trust. There is an argument that we know how much compensation people should receive in such cases. I do not know how much one should compensate someone for the death of a loved one as a result of a mistake by the NHS. The amount could be large, especially when the lawyers get their hands on the case. They could compare the death of a loved one to Elton John's feeling that he was insulted about his sexual orientation and say, "Look at the sum that he got. The death of a loved one should bring a lot more than that."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to the mishap to which my hon. friend referred, is he aware that today is National Incontinence Day? The problems of incontinence are being emphasised—they have important implications for long-term care in the health service. In some cases, long-term care is causing the NHS to avoid its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
responsibilities and, in other cases, to drift towards bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is reasonable to set aside a day on which to consider the problems of incontinence and draw attention to a service that is important to many people. I am not critical. From time to time, I hear complaints about the lack of provision and that from my constituency surgery was one such example. Generally—I speak for my area—the service is good and important to many people, especially the elderly. It is one of the Cinderella services of the NHS, but I am happy to pay tribute to it. Having a national day draws attention to the excellent work that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Litigation could lead to bankruptcy of trust. The managers have the right to know that they will not be sent to the wall because of a mistake—it is serious as far as the patient is concerned—that was made by the consultant. There is an important role for the Department of Health. If money is to be put up to deal with liabilities, money should be found to ensure that no health authority or trust goes broke because of litigation. What arrangements are in place to ensure that is the case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a trust goes broke because of such a mistake, the rest of the area and its patients will be punished, which is wrong. There might be a central fund, but in view of the increasing trend of litigating I wonder whether that will be sufficient. I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to that cause of potential bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the only three bases on which a trust or a health authority could cease to exist that I envisage. Are there any more? Does the Minister envisage a private health company coming in, perhaps a long time in the future, with an offer to take over all the services of a trust—perhaps one dealing with mental health—and charging other NHS bodies or the Department for running them? That is an interesting concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley discussed litigation arising from the wording "cease to exist". There is a potential litigation trap and I sought to intervene on my hon. Friend to discuss it—but you, Mr. Hill, rightly made the point that I should deal with the matter in my speech, which I am doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a trust ceases to exist, clearly the managers of that trust should not be in place and running the show as they were before it ceased to exist. If they are in place—perhaps the Secretary of State will want them to be for a while, as his Department might encounter enormous problems in managing the affairs of the body directly—it could be claimed that the body has not ceased to exist. It could then fall to the taxpayer to meet any new liabilities that were entered into. Arguments could arise about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a legal argument that for a trust or health authority to cease to exist, the managers should have departed. The problem is that clause 1 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State must exercise his statutory powers to transfer property, rights and liabilities of the body so as to secure that all of its liabilities are dealt with"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

not some of its liabilities, but all of them. Some of the liabilities, however, might be to the managers. If they were all sacked—it appears from the wording of the beginning of the clause that that might happen—they could sue the Secretary of State or the NHS for their liabilities under the later passage in the clause. There is a potential trap. I wonder whether the legal brains at the Department of Health have thought about it. I should be pleased if they were to say that that trap did not exist. If, however, they have not thought about the matter, I hope that they will. We do not want shoddy legislation that could result in extra liabilities for the public purse. If the Minister cannot respond now, I hope that the matter will be investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have made it clear earlier that the Register of Members' Interests shows that I receive £500 from Unison, the union that represents workers in the NHS. That money goes towards my staff costs, not to me. I did not declare an interest, because, following the work done by Lord Nolan, and the decisions of the House of Commons, Unison suspended the payment, from this year. I am not receiving that £500 now. Some hon. Members might have received the wrong impression from examining the register, and I wanted to clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unison has expressed concern about the rights of its members in the NHS and the Bill's possible effects on them. Such concerns are not confined to clause 1, but might involve much wider proposals. There is concern, for example, about the implications of PFI on members of Unison or other bodies in the NHS. However, the clause mentions the transfer of
	<br><blockquote><p>"property, rights and liabilities of the body so as to secure that all of its liabilities are dealt with."</p></blockquote>
I have questions about the rights and liabilities that relate to the workers in the trust or authority. Will the Minister guarantee that if trusts "cease to exist", as it is put in the Bill, workers' pay will not automatically stop, and they will not find themselves on the streets the next day? We need to know the detail of the arrangements, in particular how long the liabilities of the trust and health service will continue to be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue that under the arrangements, a trust ceasing to exist because of direct action by the Secretary of State, because of merger, perhaps driven by debt, or because of bankruptcy, perhaps as a result of management mistakes or litigation, is not the fault of the workers. In doing their best for their community and the national health service, they could suffer severely when the body they work for suddenly ceases to exist. The Bill mentions the Secretary of State taking it upon himself to discharge the liabilities properly. What will he do in those circumstances for the workers? It is not right to give them the barest of employment rights and to say that once the body ceases to exist, they have only the month's notice on their contracts. That would not be fair. The crucial
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
point is what is meant by the clause in relation to the liabilities and how they affect the workers. Some workers may be on training courses to improve their abilities for future use by the NHS. would those courses suddenly be stopped? I hope not. I shall be extremely interested in the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is another final point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say, Mr. Hill, an added point, which I shall make briefly. The commitment to patients should not be overlooked. They should have rights. The authority going out of business might have promised patients that they would be treated or have their operations. Arrangements should be in place to ensure that they continue to have commitments met in the appropriate time. They should not be punished for the trust going out of business. I shall be interested to hear how the rights of patients will be affected. The clause says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State…a National Health Service trust…a Health Authority; or…a Special Health Authority"</p></blockquote>
in England and Wales—there are other boards in Scotland—will pick up the arrangement for transfers of property, rights and liabilities. However, it seems to me that the key element is the assets —the property. As my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South said earlier, some of the arrangements under the PFI—which is what the Bill is all about—involve the transfer of property to a private finance institution. That will be part of the arrangement. I suspect that that is envisaged—the Minister is nodding his head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a trust ceases to exist, its property could come to the Secretary of State. Do the Government intend to propose perhaps in the near future that the Secretary of State will be able to pass that property on to a private company, consortium or institution? It would then leave the public sector. If such action is envisaged under the Bill, it is dishonest to say in clause 1(2) that transfers will only be made to public institutions, including the Secretary of State. It is dishonest because the property will go straight out of the Secretary of State's hands to the private sector under the terms of the PFI agreements that the Secretary of State will make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are to be honest about their intentions, the private sector should appear in the Bill. It is not that I want the private sector to be specified, because I do not approve of public property being handed to private companies under the PFI; but if it were specified in the Bill, we could examine the conditions relating to such transfers and we could set the conditions, as a Committee. However, in the absence of such a specification, when a trust ceases to exist, a future Minister will get his grubby hands on its property and will pass it to the private sector without anyone having any say in the matter. That worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to give an assurance, if he can, that such a transfer will not take place under the Bill. What will happen to property that has passed to the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
Secretary of State from a trust that has ceased to exist?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several serious points relating to the amendment. I am pleased that my hon. Friend tabled his probing amendment. My questions are intended to probe the implications of the Bill, and I am sure that they will elicit a serious response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief, because I am eager to hear the Minister's response to the points raised so far; however, I should like to have an opportunity to catch your eye later, Mr. Hill, and make a fuller contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is useful because it will flush out Government thinking on what they intend to achieve by means of the Bill. As I understand it, the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley would limit the circumstances in which the Secretary of State will be required to take responsibility for the debts and other liabilities of organisations referred to in the Bill. It limits such cases to those in which trusts and other organisations have been dissolved by the Secretary of State, thereby specifically excluding cases involving mergers, takeovers or bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall elaborate on those points later, but, now, we must be clear about whether the Government intend to bale out NHS trusts that, for one reason or another, commit financial hara-kiri or are subjected to massive fraud by those in charge of their financial affairs. I ask the Minister, are there any circumstances in which the Government will not bale out a trust that has gone bankrupt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment helpfully focuses debate on circumstances in which the Minister pretended that everything was rosy in the financial garden. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton rightly queried that. If everything is so rosy and there are no circumstances in which a trust will face financial difficulties, why do we need the blunderbuss term "ceases to exist", which catches virtually every financial circumstance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that trusts had been given a clean bill of health by the Comptroller and Auditor General. But for how many years has the Comptroller and Auditor General not given an unqualified opinion on NHS trusts, and how many trusts have been the subject of adverse reports in the past? Do trust accounts represent a true and fair view and can trusts be regarded as financially stable organisations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to a report that appeared this weekend in 	<i>The Guardian</i>—not a newspaper that I usually read as I prefer 	<i>The Financial Times</i>—with the title "NHS trusts face cash problems". It details one trust—the Horizon in Hertfordshire—which is effectively bankrupt. Serge Chan, co-author of the C4 Trust Monitor report, is cited as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If they were a commercial company, the bank would have foreclosed on them."</p></blockquote>
That gets to the nub of the matter. Does this amount to bailing out trusts that have been badly managed or that may be the subject of fraud inquiries in future? Do we want to give a blank cheque to trusts that could be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
taken over? Is the state to bankroll any contingent liabilities for future litigation? How can we be certain, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley asked, that a £5 billion liability will not have to be picked up by the taxpayer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 3 to the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 allows trusts to borrow without the specific approval of the Secretary of State—provided that they do not mortgage, borrow foreign currency or borrow altogether more than £5 billion. What assurances can the Government give that trusts will not borrow more than £5 billion? Trusts could get together with other trusts to establish how much has been borrowed in order to stay below the £5 billion limit. I would welcome the Minister's assurance about what practical mechanisms will be in place to hold liabilities within that figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions about the way in which decisions about bringing a trust to an end are exercised. I shall illustrate my points by referring to local experience south of the river. When the Government passed the 1990 Act, the Guy's and Lewisham NHS trust was established. St. Thomas's, over the river, was not at that stage a trust: it was in a financial mess and was not regarded as capable of being a trust. No sooner had the Guy's and Lewisham trust been set up, however, than the Government decided to re-order affairs, make Lewisham into a separate trust, and form a trust comprising Guy's and St. Thomas's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As before, a consultation process took place, but no one believed that it would change the decision. I cannot remember the details, but I think that about a fortnight was allowed between the end of the consultation process and the deadline by which the new trust was to come into operation. There was no chance that the process would be anything other than a way to steamroller the proposal through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Technically, however, a consultation process was held. A document was produced and circulated containing the arguments—such as they were—as to why Guy's and St. Thomas's should be put into one trust and Lewisham into another, which is how matter stands today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to what criteria do the Government use the absolute power that the legislation appears to allow? That power is subject only to consultation, but I interpret the 1990 Act to mean that the Government could get away without any consultation. Paragraph 29 of schedule 2 begins part IV of that schedule and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may…by statutory instrument dissolve an NHS trust".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) of that paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except where it appears to the Secretary of State necessary to make an order under this paragraph as a matter of urgency, no such order shall be made until after the completion of such consultation as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
So there is even an opt-out on the consultation if the Secretary of State declares the order to be urgent. In theory, that decision about urgency can be reviewed in the courts under judicial review, but in general terms the Secretary of State's powers are pretty comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By what criteria do the Government decide that trusts should come into being or be dissolved? The decisions seem to be entirely at the political whim of the Government of the day. There appears to be no requirement that such decisions reflect the majority view of the community or the views of those who work in the affected institutions. There appears to be no opportunity for the public to influence in any way the structure of the health service in either the acute sector or the community sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is worrying. It is always alleged that the health service is decentralised. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that the Bill was all about what would happen when—a rare case—a trust was dissolved with financial implications. In reality, the trust's borrowing can continue without authorisation from the Secretary of State, provided that the appropriate chain of command is observed in securing clearance. A degree of discretion is given to local trust management. Secretaries of State and Ministers have often told the House that a problem was not a matter for them but for a local NHS trust, yet outsiders consider the founding and dissolution of NHS trusts to be entirely based on subjective decisions by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy about that. I might, for example, want to campaign to have Guy's and St. Thomas's run as separate trusts. There would be a strong groundswell of support, but there is no way for me to achieve that objective. In Theory, people could propose to the Government that the Guy's and St. Thomas's trust should cease to exist and be replaced by two separate trusts—a Guy's trust and a St. Thomas's trust. But what would be needed to get that done? How much would people be listened to—would the views of the community health councils, local Member of Parliament, or council, be taken into account? What about the views of patients and staff? A set of questions arises about the necessary preconditions before a trust can cease to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 of the Bill begins with the bold statement
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a National Health Service trust…ceases to exist".</p></blockquote>
What criteria allow the public to know when future trusts will come into being? I want an authoritative answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service is suffering from being entirely out of public control. People feel absolutely powerless in regard to its structure. I do not pretend that the old district and regional health authority structure was wonderful, but at least some people entered it by election from, for example, the local authority. At the moment, as I understand it, everybody on trusts gets
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
there by appointment. All the non-executive directors are appointed. We are consulted about nominations, but there is no ability further to influence nominations. Those people then meet and make all their decisions in secret, so nobody can know the real considerations behind a decision. For example, if the Secretary of State were to bring about the ceasing to exist of the Lewisham NHS trust, there would be no public record of the views of individual members of the trust board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now in the sixth year of the new legislative era. One of the really unsatisfactory aspects of the way in which the health service now works is that hospitals and other services that are provided by the NHS, although in theory local and independent, are local but absolutely not independent. They are brought into being and dissolved in the same way as courtiers were summoned and dismissed by medieval despots. That is entirely unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be possible to have a process whereby one devolved to a democratic regional health authority—which my colleagues and I support—decisions on where trusts were needed. That would thus be decided at a regional level. Those authorities could consult community health councils, Members of Parliament and others, who could give their view. Then democratically elected regional health authority could decide whether a trust came into being or not. As of 1 April, we will no longer have regional health authorities. We will have only regional outposts, which is another description of regionally located civil servants who are accountable to the chief executive of the NHS, so there is no democracy there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the old days before the NHS, hospitals were freestanding and independent, but there was normally a degree of local accountability, in the sense that they had trustees who were appointed by local boards of works, local charities, and so on. They had some rooting in the local community. Hospitals such as Guy's and St. Thomas's—to take the same examples—were much rooted in the community. Now they are physically located in it, but they are not rooted in it, in a democratic sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful, to hear the authoritative Department of Health definition of the factors that are taken into account when deciding the coming into being or the ceasing to exist of NHS trusts. Will the Minister say what I and my colleagues on both sides of the House—it is not a party-political matter—can do if we want to persuade the Government that a particular trust should cease to exist and that another trust should come into being?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the Minister or the Secretary of State decided that the Guy's and St. Thomas's trust should be dissolved. They might decide that it was in the best interest—if one believes in a more market-driven NHS, it is logical to allow two hospitals to compete separately. If the Government decided that there should be a dissolution of the current trust and that others should be created, what criteria would determine whether all the debts went with one hospital or the other? What ensures that debts that have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
incurred, for example, by St. Thomas's hospital are not transferred to Guy's hospital? At the moment, the system seems to allows non-elected directors to fix an outcome that may be entirely independent of and unrelated to the views of the players concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What influence do hospital trustees have? St. Thomas's and Guy's Hospitals both have trustees, as the Minister knows. Are they influential? Are they entitled to express a view? Must their view be taken into account? The issue of whether the phraseology should be "ceases to exist" or "dissolved" raises many questions. "Dissolved" is a mechanism by which ceasing to exist can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are serious questions. People in my part of the world and elsewhere are troubled that no one knows the rules—that the rules are exercised by people in secret and that there is no public accountability because the process in not subject to the fig leaf of consultation—it is only a fig leaf—that trusts have to undertake. They want to know whether the Government propose to make the creation and dissolution or ceasing to exist of trusts more accountable. Will NHS trusts continue to be the creatures of the Secretary of the State of the day and have no link with the local community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate, which has dealt with much of the meat of clause 1. The hon. Member for Rother Valley was concerned about the words "ceases to exist". Let me try to reassure him. The language used in NHS legislation allows the Secretary of State to "dissolve" an NHS trust—that is the word used in connection with NHS trusts—or he can "abolish" a health authority or a special health authority. The two words "dissolve" and "abolish" are used in existing legislation. The term "ceases to exist" is used as an umbrella term to embrace both "dissolve" and "abolish". It is an example of plain English: "ceased to exist" embodies both the terms presently used in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A health authority will cease to exist when it is abolished by an order made by the Secretary of State under section 8(4)(b) of the National Health Service Act 1977 as amended by section 1 of the Health Authorities Act 1995. A special health authority will cease to exist when its establishment order made under section 11 of the National Health Service Act 1977 is revoked. Similarly, an NHS trust is dissolved by an order made by the Secretary of State under paragraph 29 of schedule 2 to the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. Those dissolutions and abolitions are contained in current legislation and the phrase "ceases to exist" embraces all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did not the Minister replace "ceases to exist" with "abolished" or dissolved"? The term "ceases to exist" has a wider definition. The definition in the Oxford Dictionary is "come to an end", which implies a situation that is out of control rather than one in which action can be taken to abolish or dissolve a body. The amendment would make the position clearer because people would know exactly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
what we mean. We do not want lawyers to ask what "ceases to exist" means under general law. The terms "abolish" and "dissolve" are written into the statute, so why change them? Why not use the terms already used in legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, because it is simpler and plainer than using the two terms "dissolve" and "abolish". It is an attempt to express the legislation in simple English—you will be familiar with this, Mr. Hill, as you have been chairing the Finance Bill Committee, in which an attempt was made to put that Bill into plain English. "Ceases to exist" is a perfectly plain phrase that encompasses both "abolition" and "dissolution", which are two rather longer words. We are merely playing with words—the intention is the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trusts, authorities and special authorities—this bears on the points of the hon. Members for Leyton and for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson)—cannot cease to exist other than by means of dissolution or abolition under the terms of the Bill. A dissolution or abolition must proceed through an order from the Secretary of State, the drafting of which would be considered by a Committee on Delegated Legislation. that will not change in practice, so we are not discussing what will happen, but simply the phrase that is used in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By using the words "ceases to exist" in a measure that deals with a private finance initiative, the Bill blurs one of the main distinctions between the public and private sectors. I expected the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Evans) to make that point instead of me. I have been involved in a venture capital company and am well aware that when a company gets into difficulties—particularly severe financial ones—it ceases to exist and people lose their jobs. When the North Yorkshire regional health authorities merged, however, people did not lose their jobs. The original organisations were dissolved, but the people, jobs and headquarters remained. There is a real distinction between the public and private sectors, but the Minister's wording blurs it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised precisely the point that I wanted to make next and about which I hope to reassure the hon. Members for Leyton and for Dudley, West. The assets and liabilities of a health trust—I shall talk about health trusts because they are the provide units with which we are most concerned—that ceases to exist in the way that I have described will be transferred. If a trust gets into difficulties, the first task is usually to sort it out. Can it be kept in existence and can its financial problems be sorted out straightforwardly by introducing a different management or different financial targets or by cutting costs? If that cannot be achieved, and the problem is more difficult, the next step will probably be to merge the trust, which might be inherently unviable or incapable of delivering the health care that is required by the area that it serves, with another trust. The trust
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
then ceases to exist. In fact, both trusts technically cease to exist when they are merged, and a new trust comes into being and takes on its predecessors' assets and liabilities. The hon. Gentleman should, be reassured that staff will continue to work under TUPE and under their existing contracts and arrangements, just as they would have done under the old trust. Property arrangements, too, will continue in the new trust, even though the two old trusts have ceased to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman for Dudley, West is carrying on his bad habits from the Committee that considered the Financial Bill, in talking at great length about particular issues, with which I cannot deal off the cuff. I shall, however, write to him about the Comptroller and Auditor General's figures that he asked me to produce. he mentioned the f5 billion limit on borrowing, which is covered in the 1990 Act. Trusts cannot collectively borrow more than £5 billion. Beyond that, there is an external financing limit, which is a requirement that is placed on particular trusts and which binds them even tighter. Those are the restrictions at the disposal of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to deal with irresponsible borrowing. I shall write the hon. Member on his point about synergy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) asked, in relation to Guy's, how much consultation there had been or would be in various situations. As he rightly said, consultation is specified in the Act except in cases which the Secretary of State deems to be of sufficient urgency. In such cases, consultation can be set aside, but in the normal course of events, consultation takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will know from his experiences, not only with Guy's, but elsewhere in the country, that consultation normally occurs on an extensive basis. It can involve public meetings and discussions with all local residents and interested parties. That usually happens. Not only that, past consultations have led to a different conclusion from that first set out by the relevant trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the criteria that the Secretary of State or a trust would consider in reaching a conclusion about whether to merge, to cease to exist or whatever. The prime purpose of any merger must, obviously, be to improve services to patients. The dissolution and merger process—I combine the two because that is what happens—is assessed on very strict criteria. Before Ministers approve any proposal, the applicants must demonstrate the following: first, that the merger will result in benefits to patients; secondly, that the trust management has the capability effectively to manage the trust; thirdly, that senior clinicians support the proposal; and, fourthly, that the new trust will be financially viable. As I said, the outcome of the statutory public consultation is also an important factor in the decision-making process, although I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
can, in exceptional circumstances of urgency, be set aside. In most cases it is not. Only when all five criteria are met will Ministers agree to a decision. I assure the Committee that a lengthy and distinct process must be gone through before any decisions about merging, starting, abolishing or dissolving a trust can take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's comments, but can he elaborate on whether the same process applies to an application for a demerger, as it were, for part of a trust to go it alone? What is the process for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, who can apply? Under the proposal just described, an application would be made by the existing trust. Who else can get into the game and make proposals? Can members of the public, the CHC, local Members of Parliament or a significant proportion of consultants, nurses or doctors make proposals—if so, how many? What are the other triggers? All I heard the Minister say was that there is a process whereby an existing trust can apply for a merger. I have not yet heard him answer the question of how people can break out of existing trusts to form a wider number of smaller trusts or what status anyone must have—other than those who are appointed by the Secretary of State and meet in secret—to get into the game.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to answer off the cuff, but I will read the hon. Gentleman's comments in the report of the Committee's proceedings, think about them and reply in due course, if that is acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying to the hon. Member for Rother Valley, I shall not make my traditional point about the amendment being technically deficient and so forth. I shall avoid doing that. I hope that I have assured the hon. Gentleman that the issue is a question of semantics. We believe that "cease to exist" is a perfectly sensible and well-recognised legal phrase which encompasses dissolution and abolition and that, in practice, nothing will affect the current process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could have referred the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey to a statutory instrument that he—the Minister—signed on 7 March and which was laid before the House yesterday: the National Health Service Trusts (Consultation on Establishment and Dissolution) Regulations 1996. For the first time, we shall debate whether, statutorily, community health councils will be consulted on the dissolution or establishment of NHS trusts. As the hon. Gentleman said earlier, we are now some years down the road from when trusts were first set up. I look forward to debating the statutory instrument. Consultation seems to be very much a matter of discretion. The Bill seems to be getting rid of consultation in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unconvinced that "ceases to exist" is adequate to cover recent changes. Depending on what Act is being considered, "abolished" or "dissolved" is used. I shall seek permission to withdraw amendment No.1,

but I look forward to returning to the issues that it poses at a later stage so that we can clarify what the Bill's wording means.
