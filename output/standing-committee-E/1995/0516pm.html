	<div class='title'>APPOINTMENT OF CHILDREN'S OFFICER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"The Lord Chancellor shall make rules requiring the appointment of a children's officer to every family court care whose duties, inter alia, shall include co-ordination between parents and children and issuing advice regarding the divorce process and child welfare.".—[	<i>Mr. Llwyd.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following: New Clause 5—	<i>Special Children's Officer</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>".—The Lord Chancellor may make regulations for a special children's officer attached to the family court care centres.
	<ol>
	<li>Such regulations shall make provision for the special children's officer to make appropriate arrangements on behalf of children whose parents have—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>made a statement of marital breakdown under this Act, or</li>
	<li>have taken or are taking proceedings under Part II of the Children Act.</li></ol>
	<li>Arrangements under subsection (2) shall include the provision of information, advice or assistance, including applying to the court for the separate representation of the child.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 156, in Schedule 8, page 72, leave out lines 17 to 28 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In considering whether the circumstances are as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), the court shall have particular regard, on the evidence before it, to the general principles that:
	<ol>
	<li>the ascertainable wishes and feelings of each child must be considered by those with parental responsibility in the light of the child's age and understanding;</li>
	<li>the arrangements proposed must take account of the financial, educational, social, spiritual, emotional and physical implications for each child;</li>
	<li>the proposed arrangements do not constitute any risk to each child involved; and</li>
	<li>in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the welfare of the child will be best served by his having regular contact with those who have parental responsibility for him, his siblings, grandparents and others of importance to the child.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 153, in Schedule 8, page 72, after `live.', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d) the general principles that:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of each child must be considered by those with parental responsibility in the light of the child's age and understanding;</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to conclude with a few brief comments on the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
(Mr. Llwyd), which would establish child welfare officers. He was right to flag up the fact that there is to be a de facto change in the way in which the court welfare service operates because the philosophy and training of the probation service, which fills the posts at present, is changing so much. I will not go into the detail of the amendments; I merely voice one concern about the approach that the hon. Gentleman has outlined, which is interesting and child centred and which I broadly welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that there is a danger of our setting up a bureaucracy which, if we are not careful, could become part of social services. I have a good relationship with my local social services department so this is in no way a comment against it—but, by definition, the emphasis of social services is on children who are at risk. We are discussing private cases where children are not at risk. If we are not careful, we could stray into Children Act territory. It is important, therefore, that whatever arrangements evolve around the handling of children's issues they must be at arm's length from the social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the points made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I am especially keen for the role of children's officer to be established. It will give focus and priority to children. A children's officer will have a role with parents as well as with children. At times of divorce, parents are under stress and often in turmoil, they may need help in deciding how best to help their children. The roles as defined in the new clauses can be a useful signposting mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stronger role is that of children's officer because of the direct involvement with children. It is vital that children are involved in discussions about their contact arrangements. All the evidence now is that their views are marginal. Members of the Committee will realise that at times contact and access arrangements can be difficult for children. I am personally aware of a child who travels the length of the country—a 400-mile trip—each weekend for contact with his natural father. The child wishes to continue with the access but the arrangements are complicated and difficult. It is important that contact arrangements are practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, perhaps, even more important to listen to the voice of the child. I do not wish to rerun earlier debates, but this is an extremely important matter. I know that the Minister accepts the principle that a child's voice should be directly heard. It is far too easy to focus their views through the filter of parents. It is important for children to be able to talk about their feelings—they get confused and need to express what they think. Those who are involved in divorce are racked with personal grief and need to reconcile themselves to new circumstances. The children's officer has a role at such times. I therefore commend the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said that there were resource implications. There may be. I am keen that the role of the family law court welfare service should be looked into, along with the growing professionalism of the guardian ad litem panels. A good deal of valuable professional resources are there. I am not convinced that the children's officer necessarily
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
entails new money. Focusing on the family law court welfare service would give us an opportunity to redistribute resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been asked several times in Committee what happened to the Lord Chancellor's commitment to look into that area. That commitment was clearly given, not once, but twice, by the Lord Chancellor during the Committee stage of the Children Bill in the other place on 19 January 1989. The commitment was given at column 415 and again at column 420 of 	<i>The Official Report, House of Lords.</i> The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) has also argued the case for looking again at that area of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the nature of probation officer training has changed, it may be necessary to consider the court welfare service in future. The welfare service is composed of probation officers and 10 per cent. of probation service resources are committed to that kind of work. But officers will no longer receive social work training. The Lord Chancellor's Department is aware of that, so there is a strong case for picking up the Lord Chancellor's commitment of seven years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury has pointed out the similarities between amendments Nos. 156 and 153. But there are clear differences, too. Each amendment adds to the Bill. My preference is for amendment No. 156, for several reasons. First, that amendment removes the notion of conduct from schedule 8. In schedule 8 paragraph 23(4) the court is asked, in taking account of arrangements for children, to have "particular regard" to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conduct of the parties in relation to the upbringing of the child".</p></blockquote>
I am anxious about that. My impression was that the Family Law Bill was intended to take the notion of fault out of divorce. Bringing "conduct" back in schedule 8—and amendment No. 153 leaves it in—worries me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference in principle between conduct and fault. Fault applies at the beginning of the process. Almost by definition, one party is set against the other then. Conduct, however, comes up towards the end of the process in cases in which matters cannot be resolved amicably. Many of us, who did not favour fault, feel it right that conduct should be taken into account at that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his position clear. Before lunch, he quoted two examples in which partners had separated and arrangements had been made for the children. To paraphrase him, one involved a mother who left her children, began to cohabit with someone and was eventually reunited with the children in the family home. Value judgments come into that. The hon. Member for Canterbury knows the case better than I do, and the notion of conduct is being explored fully. We should be considering how parents conduct themselves in their relationships with their children rather than the conduct of the parties towards themselves in the past and in the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 156 ensures that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposed arrangements do not constitute any risk to each child involved".</p></blockquote>
That is right and proper. The arrangements must ensure that a child is put beyond risk. Schedule 8 and amend-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
ment No. 153 spell out in detail the sort of risks that should be considered by a court when it makes an arrangement for a child. Two hurdles have been erected. First, the court should consider the risk to the child from the person with whom it is proposed the child lives. Secondly, the court should consider the risk to the child from the person with whom the parent lives or is proposing to live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury was fair to make it clear that that involved a mechanism by which a court could consider the relationship between, for example, the natural father, the stepfather or the new partner and the child. He has expressed the view strongly that children are more at risk of abuse from new partners rather than natural parents. There is debate about that. All I would say is that there is no doubt that children are abused by natural parents and by new partners. To try to deny that would be manifestly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Committee proceedings began, I have taken the opportunity to examine cases of serious abuse and child death in one midland county. Abuse and death are caused by natural parents, step-parents and by new partners. The proportion of each category's involvement may change, and I know that the hon. Member for Canterbury has quoted research that suggests that new partners abuse more frequently than natural parents. Children—whoever they are at risk from—need protection. I support amendment No. 156.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that the Exeter study and Robert Whelan's analysis of four years' data in this country are wrong and that the risk of abuse from new partners and natural parents is the same, surely the hon. Gentleman recognises that the Bill and the Children Act 1989 are full of mechanisms for assessing the dangers that children face from the existing people with whom they live. Only by retaining a critical subsection can we ensure that a court considers potential risk from new partners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but amendment No. 156 is quite clear. The proposed subsection (2A)(c) states that the proposed arrangements shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"not constitute any risk to each child involved".</p></blockquote>
The notion of risk is firmly written into the amendment. That is adequate. Schedule 8 and amendment No. 153 state that a court should consider the nature of the relationships around a child. That is not necessary and may be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to guard against the possibility of a new demonology that suggests that new partners abuse and natural parents do not, which is manifestly wrong. The court should consider not the status but the quality of the relationship between carers and child. That is a significant point. The new children's officer can play an important role in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider amendment No. 156 carefully. It would set up a warning list for the court, a checklist of what would be required by the court for proper and adequate consideration to be taken to meet children's needs. I commend the new clauses and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
amendments to the Committee, and I hope that the Minister will consider them sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I asked you earlier for a ruling on when I should speak to amendment No. 156. The hon. Members for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) have done a sterling job, but I have not yet spoken to my own amendment. Would it be appropriate for me to do so at this stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My original ruling stands. It is perfectly legitimate for the hon. Gentleman to refer to amendment No. 156 in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I shall bat on then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board everything that the hon. Member for Sherwood has just said, so I shall try not to refer to matters that he has already covered. Amendment No. 156 is designed to provide judges with a warning checklist of matters to which they will have to pay regard when considering whether the agreed arrangements made for the children by divorcing parents require the issuing of Children Act proceedings. It supplies a series of presumptions that would normally be fulfilled in deciding future arrangements for children and would provide a framework within which to assess whether the proposed arrangements necessitate further inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The presumptions built into the amendment reflect recognised good practice in relation to decisions about children's welfare. The presumptions are that the wishes and feelings of children should be ascertained when future arrangements for contact and residence are being made, that their concerns should be properly considered at that time and that the arrangements should be organised to meet the needs of the children and not simply, for example, to satisfy principles of equity between parents. In other words, the arrangements must take full account of children's need for emotional stability, to develop their own friendships and to have time for the demands of school work. Choice of school should also be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child is expected to travel to visit the absent parent each weekend, the implications of disruption to friendship networks and schooling and the strain of regular travelling must be fully considered. Of course the child is also entitled to protection from harm and the arrangements must not expose the child to any risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child's well-being will, I believe, in general be best promoted by continuing contact with brothers and sisters, both parents, the wider family and others who are of importance to the child. Amendment No. 156 is designed to ensure that when the parents agree about arrangements for the children there is a framework for independent scrutiny by the court to ensure that the arrangements comply with important principles of good practice. If they do not, the need for further investigation should be identified at an early stage, before the situation deteriorates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear the Minister's response. I urge upon him the good sense of the amendment. I differ on a small point with the hon. Member for Canterbury, who tabled amendment No. 153, and I believe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
that my amendment is preferable, because I do not believe that conduct is being ignored in process in any event, so one could argue that amendment No. 153 unnecessary. That is the only issue between us. I commend the new clauses and the amendments to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been a useful focus upon the position of children within the divorce process. It is necessary to turn our attention in that direction. There is widespread concern on both sides of the Committee and also among the children's organisations about that. Having said that, I must point out that the Government believe that the amendments relating to the setting up of this structure of children's officers are unnecessary and, in a number of respects, defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments do not seem to extend to all the types of court where divorce, separation, private law and family matters are currently handled. I shall not rest on that point too long as there could probably be practical changes to the definition to address that point. However I should flag up the fact that, as drafted, these provisions would not appear to apply in all the requisite sets of circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to interrupt the Minister much this evening. If he looked as a lawyer at the words "inter alia" he would realise that the amendment is perfectly in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking specifically about the definition of family court care centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am drawing the Minister's attention to the words "inter alia", which make it plain that it is not an inclusive definition; there will be others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I anticipated that this was a point that could be addressed at a later stage by redrafting and that I did not wish to be detained at length over it. There might be an argument about semantics between the hon. Gentleman and me. I am simply highlighting what my instructions are, I know the hon. Gentleman will not accept the point, but I hope we will not detain the Committee by arguing about this: the point is one that will be coverable. I am simply highlighting the defect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also appears that the post of children's officer that is envisaged by the amendment would have a multiplicity of roles, and three specifically. They are: providing information and advice about the legal process; liaison over children's attendance or otherwise at court; and advising on whether there should be separate representation. Those are different roles. They stretch from the purely administrative to what is in many circumstances a quasi-judicial function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such functions would not easily be carried out by one person. It should be recognised that they are already being covered by experienced professionals in the current system. That point was made by the hon. Member for Sherwood in support of the amendment because he was concerned about funding for one part of the system. His remarks confirm that elements are already in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
The current structure is supported by the requirements of the Children Act 1989 for the court to have the best interest of the child as its primary consideration in questions which concern the child's upbringing. We should never lose sight of that in this debate when we are looking at the interests of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some contributions, not necessarily from hon. Members who are present in the Committee at the moment, have lost sight of the fact that Parliament has already decided that, in relation to the Children Act, on the core issues of a child's upbringing the interests of the child are to be paramount. We all underline and endorse that but it is already part of our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have court staff who are well used to dealing with queries from families—for example about arrangements for children to attend court. All care and family hearing centres also have dedicated family sections so that the staff have specific expertise in that, although they do not have an advisory function in relation to the court itself. There is a good reason for that, as parties may obtain their own legal advice or seek the services of a mediator, both of whom will be far better placed to take account of all of the circumstances of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am impressed by the way the courts have developed those services in more recent years. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has practised in Wales for many years, as I have. We can both well recall occasions when children were dealt with most inappropriately when they came before the courts. Even though I have seen a vast improvement, particularly in recent years as a result of the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, who has addressed the House on these issues in the past, and even though we should mark the fact that there has been an improvement, that is no reason why we should not endeavour to push for further improvement. One idea would be to take that function and assimilate it with a range of other functions within the new post, whereas my argument is that there is a distinction between some of those responsibilities and we are better placed for endorsing the moves that have already been made and building on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 7(1) of the Children Act 1989, the court may require a court welfare officer to prepare a welfare report to assist in ascertaining what arrangements are in the child's best interests. The production of the welfare report will often include ascertaining the wishes and feelings of the child. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury may have some observations to make later on. I know that he has a positive view about the way in which those responsibilities are taken on in his area. He has told me that and has shared that information with the Committee. That is another illustration of the way in which good practice can be developed still further. I do not want to anticipate a later debate, but it is part of the code of practice for family court welfare officers that they should behave in the way outlined by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My amendment on that subject has been ruled out of order so, unfortunately, I will not be able to make that point, but I thank my hon. Friend for making it for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have inadvertently pleased my hon. Friend. The code of practice, if followed in all cases, would address his concerns on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child's interests can, as I say, be addressed under the current structure. In any family proceedings where the court is sufficiently concerned about the child's welfare for it to believe that a care or supervision order may be appropriate, the court may direct the appropriate authority to investigate the child's circumstances under section 37(1) of the Children Act. Those are already designated as specified proceedings under section 41 of the Act; hence a guardian ad litem can then he appointed to represent the child. That is another way in which the child's interests can be accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the matter of solicitors. Section 10(8) of the Children Act enables a child to make an application as long as the court is satisfied that the child is of sufficient understanding to do so. The child would be eligible for legal aid for such an application and so would be able to have legal representation. There is concurrent jurisdiction between all levels of court in Children Act cases. A direction of the president of the Family Division has specified that all cases in which a child has made an application should be referred to the High Court, and the services of the official solicitor are available at that level should the court regard additional representation as desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In determining whether such an application should proceed, the court has to decide whether the child is of sufficient understanding to appreciate the possible consequences of his actions. The new clause proposes that someone would advise on whether the child could be separately represented. The impetus may not always come from the child. The result of such an intervention in some circumstances could be that the child would be invited to take sides with one of his parents. That could be a distressing outcome for a child and would have certain applications not only for the child but for his ongoing relationship with his parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An even more distressing situation would be the reverse of the coin, when the child's distress was not flagged up.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases where parents are likely to be able to resolve issues of dispute for themselves, mediation offers a better opportunity for the voice of the child to be heard than the existing system. That is because mediators will

always remind parents of their parental responsibility and the need to take account of the views of their children when reaching an agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us how asking the parties who are at odds to consider the interests of the child will ensure that the voice of the child is heard? Is he saying that, while doing that, the mediator should arrange a separate meeting with the child? If so, that is one course of action; if not, and if he is saying that it is merely a hope that the voice of the child will be conjured up by asking parents whether they have taken into account, he is profoundly misguided and has misunderstood the nature and impact of mediation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be aware that mediation organisations address the wishes of children and, from time to time and in such circumstances, see the children. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman should not scoff at that. That is the practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only am I not scoffing, but I discussed that practice with the Minister in the previous sitting. I am not scoffing at the practice, because I gave him a number of alternative ways forward. I want to ascertain whether his response to my hon. Friends envisages that that should always take place to ensure that the voice of the child is heard. If he is not saying that, how will that voice be heard if he rejects the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's observations clearly show that he supports the child being interviewed in all circumstances. That, in essence, is the thrust of his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point has been made more than adequately by the hon. Member for Brent, South. The gist is that the two parties are under emotional stress and are warring against each other. In some cases, regard will not be paid to the wishes of the child. The amendment would ensure that, in such circumstances, the mediator does not tell the mother or the father, "Make sure that little John is looked after." That is no good at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The voice of "little John" should be heard; that is all we are asking for—it is basic common sense. It is disingenuous of the Minister to refer to childcare proceedings. We are all aware of them, but childcare proceedings might not be contemplated in certain cases. Nevertheless, there should be a safety net for those cases in which the voice of the child will be unheard and his interests will be acted against, to his detriment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The safety net may not be needed very often, but I urge the Minister to think carefully about the matter.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
Frankly, the responses that we have had have been mechanical and the result of prior briefings. They have not addressed the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is drifting to a discussion of the other amendments which relate to the way in which the court looks at the arrangements made for the children. I am addressing his specific proposal, also argued for in a different format by the hon. Member for Brent, South, for a special new post of a children's officer to apply in every court throughout the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am telling the Committee—I have now done so at length—of the range of ways in which the interests of children are already taken into account by people in the various roles that I have outlined, which stretch from administrative to quasi-judicial functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the hon. Member for Sherwood of my concern about how the proposed mechanism might be carried forward. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is taking me into the second part of the debate, relating to his amendment and that tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, which I understand are supported by the NSPCC and other children's organisations, and which relate to the factors to be considered by the judge in the context of the divorce proceedings. That is a different issue. I understand the motive, but the practical effect causes me concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to examine the context of section 41. My view—and the advice that I have been given—is that application of the principles that are set out in the amendments would require in every divorce case that involved children a level of scrutiny amounting to a full-scale Children Act proceeding. The purpose of section 41 is to provide a bridge between the divorce procedures and procedures under the Children Act 1989—a mechanism that would enable the court to decide whether, in the light of the arrangements made or proposed, it should exercise its powers under the Act to protect a child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that when the court carries out its function under section 41, it will be dealing with cases in which the arrangements are uncontested or in which a Children Act order has already been made—in which event the welfare criteria in section 1 of the Children Act 1989 would have been applied, or proceedings under the Act would already be in progress. As all hon. Members are aware, an important underlying principle of the Children Act 1989 is that parents should be encouraged to take responsibility for their children, and that orders should not be made unless they would be in the children's interest. That important principle can be made to work only if the state and the courts do not interfere with decisions made by the parents, unless it is necessary in the interest of a child for them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the court would not, in carrying out its function under section 41, make orders under the Children Act 1989 relating to the children, the welfare criteria I section 1 of the latter Act could not be applied. It would not be possible for the court to apply criteria that clearly relate substantive decisions, such as where the child should live, to a procedural mechanism that is designed to enable the court to decide whether it should exercise its powers under the Children Act 1989. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
court would have to examine the statement of arrangements before it, and by other evidence, to decide whether it should deal with the matter under that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I pointed out the other day, the rules that govern the operation of section 41 make it clear that, where the court is concerned that it may have to make an order under the Children Act 1989, it can require parties to file further evidence. It also has the power to order a welfare report and to require the parties to attend before the judge. If the circumstances suggest that the court is likely to have to exercise its powers under the Children Act 1989, the matter will be taken further under that Act. That means that the court's decisions must proceed on the basis that the child's welfare is paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the function of section 41. It is not intended to allow interference with the arrangements made by the parents, nor to require a full-blown trial in every case. If a trial is necessary, it will take place under the Children Act 1989. A parent who is not happy with the residence or contact arrangements can make that known to the court and take proceedings under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that it is uncontested arrangements that are dealt with under section 41. Therefore, interference with those arrangements can and should occur only if the court considers that it must exercise its powers under the Children Act 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mere fact that the court is dealing with a section 41 uncontested arrangement does not imply that the uncontested arrangement is satisfactory for the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that point later. I am aware of the concerns of some children's organisations about it. However, I am trying now to describe the practical application of section 41, and the consequent implications of the amendments. The Government have proposed amending section 41, so that it specifies circumstances to which the court should have particular regard when deciding whether it should exercise its Children Act powers. Although the hon. Gentleman's amendments are drafted in terms of general principles, the first circumstance is not a general principle: it is an injunction to parents. It is not guidance for the court. As I said on Tuesday, although we all believe that it is desirable for parents to consider the wishes and feelings of their children, statutory provision for such a duty is not workable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Astonishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen to my comments, which are based on our interpretation of new clause 2. If one places such a duty on parents, is it envisaged that they will be brought to court and cross-examined? Would children be cross-examined to ascertain whether their parents had fulfilled their duty? That is the implication of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee agreed on Tuesday that the wishes of children should not be overriding. How would the statement, "I didn't want to move house, but my mum and dad still went ahead and moved after their divorce", tie in with the duties that the new clause would establish?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
The Government's amendment was tabled after much debate and advice from parliamentary counsel about what was technically correct and workable. Amended section 41 is all that is necessary to enable the court to perform its function. Above all, it is workable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the anxieties that several children's organisations have outlined about the section 41 procedure and the way in which the statement of arrangements is presented to the court. My officials had a continuing dialogue about those matters with children's organisations. We shall continue with those discussions to endeavour to find a way forward. However, the new clause is not workable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is, as usual, to go round the bushes to find a way of doing nothing. He has done that time and again. The new clause represents a perfectly modest attempt to improve the Bill. We support new clause 5 and new clause 2. Their substance should be included in the Bill. There is no need to reiterate the arguments that were ably presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood and by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. We are determined to find a way in which to ensure that the voice of the child is heard, and its position taken into account, not as a tie-breaker between the parents, but as a matter of principle. In the context of the dissolution of marriage, the child is more than the summation of its parents' desires for it. That should be acknowledged in the Bill. That is the purpose of the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, when we considered domestic violence, I said that, all too often, its impact on the child who witnesses it is ignored. The court should have attached to it—I emphasise "attached"—an officer to take account of children's needs. That is very important. I take the point about the dangers of great bureaucracies. However, we are talking not about an extension of local authority bureaucracy, but about someone who is attached to the court centre, who is part of the workings of the court and whose function is to focus on the child's needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One such need may well be for counselling to deal with the post-traumatic stress disorder that can occur when a child has witnessed violence within the home. Some useful work has been done by David Fish, a solicitor, who has reviewed some of the research conducted in this area for the purposes of an input to the development of the law relating to the representation of the child's interests. The point is well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood—it was envisaged by the Lord Chancellor in 1989—that we would have the opportunity of revisiting the issue in successive pieces of legislation, not with view to finding reasons not to act, but with a view to acting. Time and time again, the Minister finds a reason not to act. If only he would follow the Lord Chancellor's strictures on the way in which we review the operation of existing law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research on women who are in refuges with their children, which has been revisited by Mr. Fish, has enabled comparisons to be made between children in non-violent and violent homes. Not surprisingly, children in violent homes have a greater tendency to behavioural problems, particularly aggressive behaviour. There is a greater degree of rebelliousness and delin-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
quency. They have problems associated with depression, phobias, obsession, academic underachievement, poor school attendance and a whole raft of other problems that are the direct result of exposure to violence in the home. Consequently, there is a need for a qualified person attached to the court to take the child's needs into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are far from satisfied with the Minister's response to the debate. We shall join the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy in pressing new clause 2 to a vote. If the hon. Gentleman is unwilling to do that, we shall—by your leave, Mr. O'Hara—press new clause 5 to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. I have it in mind not to push my new clause to a Division because I wish to keep my powder dry for Report. I am not satisfied with the Minister's response. The sheer panoply of child welfare agencies makes the point clearly: we need a co-ordinator. We do not need new legal problems and avenues, but a co-ordinator who could suggest directions that could be taken and bring in people when necessary. The services are in place but we badly need a co-ordinator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may draw an analogy, there is a crisis in the beef industry. Various measures are being tried, but there is no co-ordination. The ship is rocking and is just managing to keep afloat. We could have got where we wanted to go much sooner if there had been some co-ordination. I do not want the same thing to happen in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Minister to say, "My door is open. I shall continue to speak to the children's organisations." Those organisations tell me that the Minister always receives them very politely, as I would expect, and talks to them, but they do not get anywhere. We will not get anywhere before Report by going through the Minister's door. I say that with great respect, as I hold the Minister in considerable personal regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not divide the Committee today, not because I have lost confidence in the proposals, but because my patience is running low at present, although I am a mild-mannered person. I promise, however, that I shall return on Report with a vengeance. I shall ensure that the proposals is properly argued and hope for a better and more considered response from the Minister.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause, in essence, is what is known in Scottish law as the Scottish duty. In effect, it is already in the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and it is supported, in principle, by the Solicitors Family Law Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause sets down a principle that children whose parents are divorcing should have the right to be consulted about the arrangements that their parents make for their future, as it is of vital interest and importance to them that their views be taken into account when decisions are taken. The new clause would enshrine that right in law and bring the position in England and Wales into line with that pertaining in Scotland since the enactment of section 6 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents fail to agree arrangements for the children, and the issue comes to court, the court must by law consider their ascertainable views. The authority for that is section 1(3) of the Children Act 1989. It is illogical for children's views to be given statutory recognition if the matter is contested, but not if the parents agree, a point I made earlier, Whether the parents agree is immaterial to the child's welfare. In many cases the arrangements made may be satisfactory; the child will be happy and everything will be perfectly acceptable. However, we cannot ignore the small percentage of cases in which matters do not go smoothly, as it may mean a ruined young life, which every member of the Committee will be concerned about. If the new clause is not accepted, we will be failing many people, especially children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill encourages parents to consider the welfare, wishes and feelings of their children when making arrangements for their future at three stages in the divorce and mediation process. The First stage is in clause 8, at the information meeting, the second is in clause 11 when legal representatives are involved and the third is in clause 24 when the Legal Aid Board enters into a contract for the provision of mediation services. However, those are merely indirect ways to encourage parents to consult their children; it is an illogical and serious omission in the Bill that it does not impose a direct duty on parents to do so. The proposal would remedy that important deficiency. If the children's views are sought, heard and given due consideration by the divorcing parents, the chances of the future arrangements made for them working well will be much improved, to everyone's benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 would not make children's views the determining factor in decisions about future arrangements. As has been said, children are, of course, immature adults and their testimony should be considered accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would not compel children to express a view against their wishes. Clearly, if they wanted to express a view, that would be fine. They would normally be invited to do so, and rightly so. The clause would not compel parents to discuss highly personal matters about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
their children with the children themselves. The duty to seek children's views would extend only to future arrangements affecting them, such as where they will live and arrangements for future contact with the parent who does not have care of them at that time. That is made plain in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provisions such as those in new clause 4 are workable in Scotland under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. I say that before the Minister says that the new clause is not workable. I invite him to apply to the Bill the same criteria as those used in Scotland to ensure that there are safeguards for children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be very disappointed if there is the same old bland response. I hope that I have been polite during debates. We deserve better, however, than a mechanical spewing out of brief.

The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has referred to the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, which deals with making decisions about the exercise of parental responsibility. The Bill is different from the legislation on such matters within that Act. The hon. Gentleman said that such provisions work well in Scotland. As I have said, if a duty to take account of the wishes of the children were placed upon parents, how could if be enforced? It is not good enough to say that we can dismiss that question. It is an important, practical consideration. Of course, we all want legislation that shows that we care about our children and want their voice to be heard. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have been an active campaigner on the need to listen to children, but clause 1 of a Bill saying, "We must listen to children" is just a soundbite. Its a question of how that can be covered by practical legislation. The hon. Gentleman says that the system works well in Scotland,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
but my information is that such a duty, even within the context of parental duty under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 is virtually unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a piece of information that I want to share with the Committee—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know whether the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy wants to listen to my response to what I thought were genuine points. He and I have known each other a long time and I know that he cares deeply about these matters, so I think that he should do me justice by listening to my response to the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents who are divorcing sometimes bring their children into the disagreements that they have. Children can be fed information about one parent by the other, which influences them and could damage their relationship, which should not be lightly dismissed. Often parents may genuinely believe that they are acting in the best interests of their child, but because they are so deeply affected by what has happened with their partners, they may not be thinking clearly. I am concerned that if there were a duty in primary legislation, some parents might exert a great deal of pressure on their children. It is important that the wishes of children should be taken into account, but the Bill already makes provision for that to be impressed on parents by solicitors and mediators. That is preferable; the matter will be discussed by parents and a third neutral party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a duty in legislation, I do not know how it could be verified that a parent had had regard to the child's views. How does the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy envisage that we will be satisfied that the child's views have been considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give one or two answers to that question. We referred the other day to a guardian ad litem being appointed; he could convey the child's wishes. Presumably the co-ordinating officer—the children's officer, to whom we have just referred—could ensure that the child's views are heard. Those two answers spring to mind immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come back to the hon. Gentleman's earlier amendments, but we are now discussing his proposed new clause which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parties who—
	<ol>
	<li>have made a statement of marital breakdown under the provisions of Part 1 of this Act, and</li>
	<li>are making any decision which involves fulfilling a parental responsibility or exercising a parental right"—</li></ol></p></blockquote>
that is a responsibility thereafter under the Children Act, but we cannot amend that Act in this legislation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard … to the views … of any child for whom they have parental responsibility".</p></blockquote>
How does the hon. Gentleman anticipate that provision being enforced? Who is to say that in taking account of the child's views, the parent is taking a right or wrong decision? Yet again, the hon. Gentleman's proposal would be unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are technical difficulties with the drafting of the motion with regard to parental responsibility. A step-parent making a statement of marital breakdown would not necessarily have to consult the child, as the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
step-parent may not have parental responsibility. Equally, the motion would impost a duty to consult a child who was not affected by the divorce. Those are some of the practical outcomes of the drafting of the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the new clause is intended to raise the profile of children in the divorce process. I know the commitment of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy to that objective. However, the Government's main aim in introducing the Bill is to improve the experience of children caught up in the divorce. The central proposals of the Bill—in particular, the removal of fault-based divorce, which would also introduce a period for reflection and consideration during which time the parents would be invited to focus on arrangements for the future, especially for the children—are the best way to ensure that the profile of children within the divorce process is raised from its present unsatisfactory state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed to hear that the Scottish provision does not work. I used to work in the Scottish Home and Health Department and played a role in introducing children's hearings and children's panels in Scotland. I have always had a high regard for the country from which my hon. Friend's boss, my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, originates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not the Scottish provision works, and even if the clause is not enforceable or workable, I want to make it clear to my hon. Friend that between now and Report the Government must think much more seriously about how best to provide that the majority of children have the opportunity, if they wish, to have their views taken directly into account. I accept the difficulty of enforcing such an arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the majority of children will have expressed those views to an aunt, a granny or another member of the extended family, not to their parents or a court welfare officer. As the British Telecom forum pointed out, it is almost impossible for parents who are caught up in the anguish, anger and despair of divorce to present themselves in such a way that the children feel able to talk to them without running the risk of adding to the anguish. The children are more likely to speak to someone outside that clique.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Bill to provide some assurance that when the decision is taken about what should be done, the views of the person to whom the children have confided, if not the children directly, are taken into account. I hope that my hon. Friend will take that plea seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Because of the extension of the application, I have tabled amendment Nos. 64 and 65 to ensure that there is the flexibility to prescribe the particular circumstances in which the requirements must be met under the provision.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For some of us, this is the last major debate in what have been long and interesting Committee proceedings. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his considerable forbearance. We have pestered him about this set of amendments since the beginning and he has patiently discussed the matter with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 and schedule 2 allow final orders, if not amended, at any time after the statement of breakdown, which starts the divorce process. If the amendments or similar provisions are not accepted, the home, money and the children can be settled at any time after statement. Lawyers know—indeed, it is common sense—that once the home is settled, the chances of reconciliation are almost nil. Furthermore, if an early final order can be obtained, nothing is left for mediation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After 18 months or 12 months, depending on the circumstances, mediation effectively becomes redundant. That is quickie divorce with a vengeance, in all but name—it is everything except the piece of paper saying that the couple are divorced an that they can remarry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2, unamended, allows the final order to become immediately effective when the court deems it to be "exceptional" and "just and reasonable" in all the circumstances. Every lawyer knows that that is, in effect, a wide loophole. Experience of divorce and other courts shows that they are willing to listen to exceptions to beat time limits. I shall give examples. Let us consider the word "reasonable". Anyone who knows what the courts have done with the word "unreasonable", as a ground for a divorce with an old fault clause, will realise that the courts have allowed it in every case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The grounds cannot be "unreasonable". The law refers to a person's conduct being as such that it would not be reasonable to expect the other person to live with him or her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is still valid. The hon. Gentleman has corrected me on the detail, but the use of the word "reasonable" in the courts, as tested, illustrates that they are willing to interpret it extremely widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the other gate to the process: the word
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
"exceptional". As lawmakers, we all know what "exceptional" means—the one unusual case that is different from the many others. We should examine, however, how the courts, handling each case separately, treat the word. For example, in tens of thousands of asylum cases asylum seekers have been granted exceptional leave to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If schedule 2 is not substantially amended—either as proposed in the amendments or by amendments that are very similar—there will be super-quick divorces, straight after the three-month interval, in everything but name. People will not have the piece of paper stating that they are not married, but all the items that I have mentioned—the children, the home and the money—can be tied up in a very short time, especially if the two parties consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may well ask whether there is anything wrong with that and whether it matters. I was pleased to go into the Lobby with the Government on Second Reading—and I hope that I can be as pleased to go into the Lobby with the Government on Third Reading—because my hon. Friend the Minister said that the Government were putting an end to fast divorces and that there would be an absolute one-year gate on divorces, a period subsequently extended in many circumstances by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). However, the schedule represents a hole through which a legal coach and horses can be driven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making a theoretical point about what may have been said in the Chamber. I give an example from my constituency of how the proposals would work. The case was brought to my attention in the past few weeks, although it occurred a couple of years ago. A young man was devastated to be told by his wife that she had decided to go off with another man. They had two small sons, aged seven and five. As the Committee can imagine, he was emotionally shattered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the subsequent week or two, the man agreed to a settlement that would give his wife custody of both children, the house—the wife and her new man would require the house because of the children—and a generous financial arrangement that probably went beyond what the Child Support Agency would have demanded. Fortunately, the settlement was not legally finalised, and, at the last hour, he was saved by the diligence of the court welfare officer, who had spent nearly two hours with each of the two children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officer decided to his absolute satisfaction that the seven-year-old was determined to stay with his dad. Until the officer told the man of that, it had not even crossed his mind that he could, as a father, have a serious chance of gaining custody. The officer interviewed the man's parents—who were relatively young—to establish what their home was like and that there would be a proper home for the little lad. The settlement was rapidly unpicked and re-sorted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we allow the law to grant immediately not only final orders but the execution of final orders, subject only to the far too weak bars on the process, such cases—if they have gone just that little bit further and have been tied up—will be unchangeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Minister, as they represent a small step forward. By
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
allowing variations to the order, my hon. Friend would prevent some such cases from happening—it would be possible to return to court to have the order varied. Those variations will not apply, however, if a final order has been executed, and as the final order can be executed subject only to two weak tests—I have tried to show just how weak the "just and reasonable" in all the circumstances test and the "exceptional" test are—settlements such as I have described can be signed, sealed and set in concrete. The purpose of the 12-month period that we agreed to on Second Reading—as a time for reflection, the opportunity for marriage counselling and reasonable mediation—would be just so much hot air. Effectively, there would be a super-quickie divorce that would have gone through in everything except the final piece of paper saying that a person was divorced and could remarry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one last point which is a genuine reflection on history, not a technical point. It was consideration of the fact that it was all rather pointless that led to the uncontentious abridgement of the gap between decree nisi and decree absolute from six months to six weeks. Similarly, there will be a Law Commission report within five years if we do not pass amendments now. The report will say that the hard-and-fast one-year provision before a person can divorce is a waste of time because there are so many de facto divorce cases just after the end of three months, so why not let them have the piece of paper as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a limit of at least 12 months on the execution of final orders to allow time for the variation to bite, so that people do not become divorced in all but name immediately following the end of the three-month period. I know that that is not what my hon. Friend the Minister intended. In all our discussions there has never been a hair's breadth of difference between us as regards intent; the problem is in the drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend expressed his case extremely well so I need only be brief. That does not mean, however, that I do not feel strongly about this extremely important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not vote on Second Reading but my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury did. Some people, including lawyers who advise us, have supported the Bill until now, but they feel so strongly about this one point that, unless the Government are prepared to make a concession now or on Report, they take the view that the Bill should not be supported on Third Reading. That is not my view, it is the view of our advisers, who are infinitely knowledgeable about the law. They know what happened in the past and are fearful of what will happen if the Government do not accept an amendment to create a court-free zone, for six or 12 months—ideally the latter. If that does not happen, in divorce by consent pressure will be put on people to wrap things up quickly, perhaps within weeks after filing their statement of marital breakdown. This effectively, will lead to super-quickie divorces, as my hon. Friend described. That will happen, as it did in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course people will not be able to remarry for 18 months, but the divorce will have been obtained. Everything will have been tied up and there will be no pros-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
pect of reconciliation. As my hon. Friend said, people will point to that as absurd. Everything will have been wrapped up and agreed in a few weeks. The order will have been made, so why make people wait for 18 months? That will be the argument. It would be unfair on them and on the children. The waiting time should he abridged. We heard it all before when there was originally a six-month wait between decree nisi and decree absolute. After many arguments, the period was abridged to six weeks. That is why there are quickie divorces, but I thought that everyone had agreed that there should not be quickie divorces. The purpose of the Bill, apparently, was to sweep away law that has been with us for so long and have a decent period of 12 months, 18 months or two years during which people would be able to reflect. Unless the Government make a serious concession—on Report if not now—not only might hon. Members consider voting against Third Reading, having previously voted for it, but the position will become extremely serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to take on board the excellent points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury. I talked to the Lord Chancellor last week. I know that he and my hon. Friend the Minister feel that people's minds should be focused on what will happen to their children and property before the divorce order is made. They do not want people to get divorced and still be arguing about ancillaries for weeks, months or years afterwards. I know that that is what the Lord Chancellor thinks. Perhaps, therefore, there is a philosophical divide on this point between the Lord Chancellor and me. I accept that it is reasonable to want to concentrate people's minds on settling matters if they are definitely getting divorced. But there is no reason why they should not think about those matters but avoid having an order set in stone for a period of 12 months. Then, during the 12 months, there is at least a prospect for reconciliation. Once there is an order, the prospects for reconciliation will be virtually nil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has done a great service to the Committee, not only today but in numerous meetings with the Minister on this point. I very much hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will feel able to make some concession, if not today, then on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Canterbury and for Gainsborough and Horncastle have clarified the issue under debate. There may well be a division of view between us. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is right about the timing of the making and the taking effect of the financial provision and property adjustment orders; a core part of the Bill is intended to ensure that during the period of reflection and consideration people focus on sorting out arrangements for children and their financial and property arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That idea is important to reconciliation itself. One disadvantage of the existing law is that parties can divorce without making decisions about their future financial arrangements. The Bill changes that significantly. Making the parties decide their financial arrangements before divorce forces them to focus on what life will be like afterwards. I rather hope that some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
people will decide that they do not want that sort of life and decide not to get divorced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statistics tell us the financial implications for both parties who go through a divorce. I cannot say that the new structure will mean a huge reduction in the number of divorces. I was invited to say that on Second Reading, and could not. What I can say is that some people who are divorcing today do not know the financial implications. Having people focus on life after divorce is, in fact, a positive thing. It may work towards the very thing to which my hon. Friends have attached so much attention—persuading people to be reconciled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has given an example of what he considers to be the disadvantageous application of the current law. If his example is seen through the structure of the Bill, however, he will find that we are erecting many more hurdles than there were in the case that he outlined. First, there will be a requirement to attend an information meeting. My hon. Friend said that his constituent did not have access to the right advice, did not understand the process and was led into making a disadvantageous agreement. Under the Bill, he would have all the requisite information, including information on the availability of marriage guidance counsellors. Secondly, there would be a gap of three months before a statement of marital breakdown would be filed. The structure emerging from the Committee will manifestly be better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our policy is to ensure that people focus on the implications for their children and their finances of proceeding with a divorce, we must give courts the power to make orders relating to finance and property before the divorce or separation order is made. The execution of them is a different matter. If we could not make such orders, the parties would not be able to embody agreements that they have made or have them placed in a court order during the period for reflection and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains two provisions that are designed to ensure that the making of orders does not prevent a subsequent reconciliation between the parties. We have inserted the general rule that a court can make orders between the divorce and the separation order. Those orders cannot take effect before the divorce or separation order operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had many discussions with my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury on these issues. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horn-castle are, in a sense, right to prefer a litigation-free zone—a period in which no one is able to get any sort of financial provision or property adjustment order other than on an interim basis. That strikes at the principle in the Bill, however. Although it is right to say that the arrangements should not come into force until a divorce or separation order is made, I envisage exceptional circumstances in which it would be positively unjust to say that no property adjustment order could be made at an early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the parties may agree that a property adjustment order may be made in exceptional circumstances should that be just and reasonable. The problem is that my hon. Friends mistrust the definitions in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
Bill and are worried about the words "exceptional" and "just and reasonable", and they have outlined the reasons for their concerns. That terminology is restrictive, and it is intended to be. The provisions will operate only in exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle referred to the expert legal advice that he has received. However, he used such advice to table an amendment that would have produced a set of circumstances that would have been infinitely wider in their application than the Government's definition in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdrew that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that my hon. Friend withdrew that amendment, but it clearly illustrates the different views as to what amounts to exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that the terminology in the Bill is restrictive, and my hon. Friends argue that it should be limited and cover no circumstances whatever. In some instances that would be unjust. The arrangements in the Bill and subsequent amendments would cover some of the exceptional circumstances described by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury. He said that one could agree to something by consent at an earlier stage, but realise later that one should not have agreed to it. A power of variation applicable if an order does not take effect deals with that point. As my hon. Friend knows, I find difficulties with the proposal to rule out all the circumstances in which such arrangements could be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend. He could help his case greatly were he to undertake that the word "exceptional" would be honoured. Every case is exceptional. No two cases are the same. If my hon. Friend's Department were to undertake to monitor the legislation and to take action if it became apparent that the changes about which my hon. Friend the member for Canterbury is so anxious were happening in a disproportionately large percentage of cases in certain courts, that would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is as helpful as ever. He has highlighted an area in which there may be a meeting of minds between my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury and me. If we can confirm that it is intended that the operation of the power should be exceptional, there should be no problem. I have made it clear to the Committee that "exceptional" is to be strictly construed. I rather thought, from other contributions that have been made, that my hon. Friends wanted there to be no exceptions whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact remains that, to take an example form an entirely different area of the law in which the word "exceptional" is used, 40 per cent. of all the tens of thousands of cases of asylum seekers in one year were deemed to involve exceptional circumstances requiring leave to remain short of asylum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter will not be left in the air. As I said to the hon. Member for Brent, South earlier in the week, the Lord Chancellor is setting up an advisory

Government amendment No. 128.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with an illogicality in the Bill. I am beginning to sound like Mr. Spock—or perhaps it should be Dr. Spock in this context. The amendments would enable interim lump sum orders to be made in favour of either party or of a child of the family in cases of nullity. An identical amendment was made in relation to paragraph (3), which deals with financial orders on divorce and separation. It is logical that nullity should be treated in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendments, which will give the court the power to make orders for interim lump sum payments on nullity. I am pleased to say that the Government can accept the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Report in the House of Lords, the Government tabled amendments to give the court a statutory power to make interim lump sum orders in favour of a party to the marriage or a child of the family when an application for a financial provisions order under new section 22A of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 on divorce and separation is made. The Government had it in mind to give the court similar powers in relation to nullity when the Bill was in the House of Lords, but were concerned not to table amendments on nullity that would risk being beyond the scope of the Bill. We are delighted to see that the amendments do not go beyond that scope, and we are therefore delighted to accept them. I hope that the legal advice that I offer the Committee on this occasion is rather more appealing than usual to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Government amendment No. 121.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to try to encourage my hon. Friend the Minister to look at the Scottish situation. There is no doubt that our courts have unfettered discretion over how they divide up property. That has been mentioned many times. Various attempts have been made over the last few years to give some guidance, but basically they have unfettered discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Justice Hoffman in Pounds 	<i>v.</i> Pounds in 1994 said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our attempt to achieve finely ground justice … we have created uncertainty and … added to the pain and costs of litigation."</p></blockquote>
The present position in this country is undoubtedly unsatisfactory. Peter Duckworth, the author of one of the standard works of reference on matrimonial property, writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Discretion depends on which judge you get. It can mean one thing in the South East but quite a different thing in the Midlands or the North. Within the same building some judges are notorious as favouring wives, others husbands; and who you get is the 'luck of the draw'. These matters bring the law into disrepute."</p></blockquote>
That is the situation in England where clearly things are fairly chaotic. There is no doubt that in certain circumstances that encourages opportunistic divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation in Scotland is far clearer. There, the assets accrued during the marriage are split 50:50 on divorce. Obviously, the parent who gets custody of the children would keep the house while they were growing up, but then it would have to be sold and the assets split 50:50. That is the Scottish law. I have modelled my amendment on Scottish law. A 1990 Scottish Office study on the workings of the 1985 Act which implemented that 50:50 division states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Act encouraged negotiated settlements for both positive and negative reasons. On the one hand, it was thought that the clearer rules provided by the legislation reduced the scope for dispute. On the other hand, it was thought to encourage voluntary agreements as a means of court-avoidance."</p></blockquote>
The 50:50 rule seems to work very well in Scotland. Indeed, it is not just in Scotland that the principle of dividing the assets 50:50 applies, but in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Not just Scotland, but many other countries believe that a broad concept of dividing the assets 50:50 works very well. Obviously, there may be a case where one party's conduct is so outrageous that that basic rule has to be varied, but in most cases it gives a sense of certainty to the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it might be difficult for my hon. Friend to build 50:50 division into the Bill without consultation. It would need a considerable amount of consultation to work out progress in this area. However, I should have thought that he could at least give an intimation that he takes the point seriously and that he will go out to consultation on it. If we were to get an amendment like this written into our law, or if after consultation some change was made, it would probably do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
more than anything else to improve the position. Although, as we have heard in earlier debates, it is maintained that it is fault-based divorce that produces the acrimony, in most cases acrimony revolves around the division of property. If people knew from the start that in most cases there would be a 50–50 split, it would make them wake up early to the fact that no one will gain from the divorce—it is King Solomon's judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will seriously consider the points that I have made. If he is unable to accept the amendments today, as he may be for the reasons that I alluded to, I hope that he will return to them at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's comments on the sensible Scottish law system of dividing assets. As in a number of other areas, Scottish law is better than English law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak to the two amendments relating to conduct, beginning with my amendment No. 82. A number of hon. Members on this side on the political argument do not support the argument for fault, but believe that there is room in the law for conduct. The difference, as we mentioned in an earlier debate, is absolutely fundamental. Because fault applies, by definition, at the beginning of the process—it is, or used to be, an argument for abridging the period that people had to wait for a divorce—it was of its nature divisive. How could people be expected to think of reconciliation if the best way that the party who wanted the divorce could speed it up was by making sometimes false allegations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conduct, on the other hand, relates to the end of the process. Along with the thousands of divorces that are filed each year by people who do not go through with them, there will be a number of marriages that go through reconciliation. Conduct does not apply in those cases. There will be others that are satisfactorily mediated through the new mediation mechanism, and conduct will not apply to them. In other cases, people will, by one means or another, be able to arrive at satisfactory settlements outside court. There will remain a hard core of cases in which there will be a fight in court. In those cases, the court should be able to say that if one part is clearly grossly to blame, that should be reflected in the division of the assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote just one example, the well-known cases of Kyte 	<i>v.</i> Kyte. Conduct can apply equally to both sides, but it happens that in this case it applies to the wife. She made false allegations against her husband in court and, as a result, he was ejected from the family home. The new man arrived to live with her. She went on actively to participate in her husband's attempt to commit suicide. When it failed, she derided him for being a wimp. When the case came before Lord Justice Thorpe, who I understand is now, but was not then, president of the family division of the High Court, he ruled that that conduct was not sufficiently serious to be taken into account, even though the existing legislation clearly states that the court is required to take conduct into account where it would be inequitable not to do so. The lower court felt that it would be perfectly just and equitable to ignore such conduct. Although the order
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
was subsequently modified on appeal, that is the climate in which we are legislating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we beef up the requirements on conduct. My amendment goes a little further than my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horn-castle is willing to go by suggesting that we remove the words "just and equitable" and effectively return to a situation where conduct is considered in all cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister's amendment effectively meets me half way by saying that we must consider the time scale of the marriage and not confine that consideration to any one type of conduct. That broadens the use of the word "conduct". His experience, as I expect he will tell the Committee, is that the only recent cases in which the court appears to have taken notice of conduct have been financial cases. I understand that, typically, those have been rather close to the breakdown process. My hon. Friend's amendment is another example of him being willing to listen to colleagues. He takes a great deal of time and trouble to listen to advice so that he can make up his own mind. He has arrived at a thoroughly sensible compromise and I welcome his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that generous comment. I shall deal first with his points about conduct. The conduct of the parties is to be taken into account by the court when it is considering financial provision on divorce where it would be inequitable for the court to disregard it. Section 25(2)(g) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, as amended by the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, replaced the previous provision which directed the court
	<br><blockquote><p>"to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other".</p></blockquote>
The reference to "conduct" as a separate factor arguably gave it greater emphasis than before. The emphasis was given to the fact that the welfare of minors must be given first consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the debates in Parliament and from the concerns that have been expressed to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury and others, it is clear that there is a perception that conduct is not, in practice, taken into account by the courts. Anecdotal evidence suggests that if conduct is taken into account, only conduct of a financial nature is considered. I said on Second Reading that I would arrange for those issues to be examined and I have studied a number of cases which relate to the role of conduct. Some of the perceptions about conduct not being taken into account are not substantiated by case law. I have been provided with a schedule of cases in which conduct has been taken into account. The Lord Chancellor's ancillary relief advisory group believes that conduct is fully considered; it did not think that the role of conduct needed reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised the matter with the president of the family division—who is not Lord Justice Thorpe, but Sir Stephen Brown. Those practical concerns have been raised with me not only by my hon. Friend but much more widely. I cannot ignore them and have therefore tabled amendment No. 121 to emphasise that conduct
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
of the parties of whatever nature, should it be inequitable for the court to disregard it, has to be taken into account and that it is not only conduct in the course of ancillary relief proceedings that is to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend understands that I cannot accept amendment No. 82. Given the hour, I shall not go into detail because he knows that the amendment would broaden the position from that in section 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle tabled amendment No. 61. I am grateful for his expectation of me being unable to accept his amendment today. He knows that the issue was raised in the other place by, I think, our noble Friend Lady Young.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will not be surprised to learn that my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor said on Third Reading in the other place that he was somewhat attracted to the Scottish system, which contains an element of discretion. He pointed out that any amendment along Scottish lines would represent a major change in the law, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle pointed out, and could not be contemplated without there being extensive consultation and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend said that he wanted to take the suggestion forward, but not within the timetable of this Bill. Therefore our position on the amendment has to remain the same. However, I can tell my hon. Friend that the Lord Chancellor will be inviting his ancillary relief advisory group to commence the review, which expects to start at the beginning of next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(iii) the commencement in either case by the party in whose favour the order was made of cohabitation with another cohabitant as defined by Section 58(1)(A) of this Act until such time as cohabitation ceases.".</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief, but the amendment relates to a significant point. It would include, among the factors limiting the term of a periodical payments order or secured periodical payments order,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the commencement in either case by the party in whose favour the order was made of cohabitation with another cohabitant as defined by section 58(1)(A) of this Act until such time as cohabitation ceases".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is simple. Under the present maintenance provisions—which, let us remember, operate both ways and can mean that an ex-wife with a great deal of money may pay maintenance to an ex-husband—maintenance payments will be affected, and in most cases cease, on the remarriage of the party
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
who was receiving payments. On the other hand, if that party begins cohabitation, bizarrely, payments are unaffected. The amendment proposes that cohabitation should, for as long as it lasts, have the same effect on maintenance arrangements as remarriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister must realise that without such an amendment we are in the bizarre position in which cohabitation appears to attract all sorts of rights. We heard some other examples of that during our debate on part IV. However, it apparently does not involve any duties. It has been argued that a new husband or wife has a financial duty towards the remarrying partner, but a cohabitee living under the same roof, in the same circumstances, would have no such duties. I find that curious and I look forward to my hon. Friend's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having been shown such generosity earlier, I am afraid that I cannot be as helpful to my hon. Friend with his amendment, which would extend the rule that periodic payments terminate on the remarriage of the payee to cover termination on the cohabitation of the payee. Cohabitation does not entail the same commitment that appears in marriage. That judgment appears elsewhere in the Bill. A cohabitant currently has no legal duty to maintain the other cohabitant and no special rules govern the distribution of cohabitants finances on the breakdown of their relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often difficult to determine the nature of the relationship and whether it involves the giving of financial support. In those circumstances, the Government do not consider that a rule that maintenance should automatically terminate on cohabitation should be introduced. The appropriate remedy for the payer in those circumstances is to apply to the court for the maintenance payments to be varied downwards or discharged. Such applications can already be made under section 31 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>"TAXATION OF CHARGEABLE GAINS ACT 1992 (c.12)</p>
	<p>45A. For section 288(3) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, there shall be substituted—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) A husband and wife shall be treated for capital gains tax purposes as living together until there has been a divorce order.'".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The amendment applies to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The explanation for it is simple. Husbands and wives who separate can currently take advantage of the no gain, no loss exemption from capital gains tax only during the fiscal year in which they separate. The necessity for a period of reflection will render this provision capable of causing severe hardship. It will work against the intentions of the Bill. It will force parties to make hasty arrangements and transfers at a time when they should reflect on whether the marriage has broken down. The amendment would allow the exemption to continue until a divorce order was granted.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under existing rules for capital gains tax, husbands and wives can transfer assets between themselves without incurring any immediate liability for tax. That applies only while the parties live together, or for the tax year in which they separate. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
amendment would allow tax-free transfers to continue after separation, until a divorce order was granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules that I described apply not only to capital gains tax, but across the tax system, especially to the married couples allowance, which is important to many taxpayers. The rules are a fundamental part of our tax system and any change could have a wide-ranging impact. Therefore, it would not be right to disrupt existing tax treatment for capital gains tax alone. It would not only grant a privilege, which was not available to other taxpayers, to the relatively small number of people who pay capital gains tax, but would run the risk of creating incoherence in the system. Even if the amendment's purpose was desirable, its implementation would require much more careful thought. The proper place for such an amendment is a Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further difficulty is that the amendment does not include a time limit. A couple might separate but not divorce for many years, if ever. It is difficult to justify reliefs for married people in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally important to consider whether the results of such a change would be desirable. Although I do not claim that the amendment would encourage separation, that is a possible practical outcome in judging some of these matters. The cardinal point, however, is that this is an isolated way of dealing with one particular aspect. More generally, these are Finance Bill matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should take this opportunity, to avoid seeming churlish, to thank the Minister for accepting the earlier amendment. However, tomorrow is another day and then we shall be back on the same old track again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear what the Minister says. Perhaps the amendment would have a greater effect than I anticipated. I still think that my proposal is right; perhaps it will, at some stage, be possible to amend the finance legislation to include it. It is quite an important point and I dare say there will be another opportunity to do something about it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are also technical amendments. They will extend the Lord Chancellor's powers in relation to consequential amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 199 is not a technical amendment—it is designed to seek assurances from the Minister and tease out certain information regarding the passage of the Bill into law and the making of regulations by the Lord Chancellor to bring it into effect. What impact will such an order have on those whose marriages have come to an end and who are living separate and apart with a view to availing themselves of the law that existed at the time they began to live separate and apart? What effect will the passage of the Bill into law and the making of an order bringing it into effect have on the intentions of those parties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been widespread concern about this matter, fuelled partly, I fear, by the Minister's remarks on the "Today" programme that there would be no divorce for a year. That was his thinking at the time; now it is likely to be considerably longer, unless further changes are made. It was proposed that there should be a period in which there was a moratorium on divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people wrote, no doubt to the Minister too, asking what would be the impact of the law on those who began to live apart before the law came into effect. For example, what would happen to a couple in the 23rd months of their separation, hoping to divorce by consent the following month? Would they have to wait a further period before being able to end their marriage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More tragic—these circumstances are often tragic—are those cases in which the couple is taking the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
five-year route, which, long awaited and long opposed, is reaching its end when the new law is brought into effect, by order. What would be the position if, in the 59th month of the five-year period that law came into effect? Would the party seeking a divorce under the five-year rule have to wait yet another period of up to 21 months? The amendment is designed to address that problem. The Minister may be able to give assurances on the matter, in which case the amendment may be unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to clarify the Government's position. As the Committee knows, the Bill provides that the sole ground for divorce shall be the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage. That irretrievable breakdown is to be proved by the passage of a period of time for reflection and consideration, starting with a statement of marital breakdown. The time should be an active period to discover whether the marriage can be saved, meeting marriage counsellors to assess whether that is the case and, when it is not, to consider what arrangements should be made for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A period of time apart before the Bill is enacted might not have been an active period of reflection and consideration in the sense that I have just outlined, because the current law does not require any such action. Periods of separation under the current law are not required to be used in any particular way; it is enough that they are purely passive periods. In addition, there is no official record of when the separation began or proof that parties have actually been separated. We know that there is misrepresentation of such matters, and as two year separation cases are by consent, it is very difficult for the courts to be sure that the information that they have is correct. However, the courts try very hard in that respect and have, on a number of occasions, refused a divorce because they were not satisfied that the separation ground had been made out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A considerable advantage of the new system is that there will be an official record of when the period began and ended, so avoiding the possibility of misrepresentation. Separation is a self-determining factor and there is no guarantee that the important issues which it is intended should be discussed during the period for reflection and consideration would necessarily have been discussed. It would, in effect, have short circuited the divorce process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I stated, in a Committee of the whole House, I do not believe that the period for reflection and consideration should be for fewer than 12 months in any circumstances. I do not accept that because parties may have been separated previously that necessarily means that they have seriously considered the implications of what they are doing, as they will be required to do under the new system. Nor will they have had the opportunity of attending information meetings and meetings with marriage counsellors or have been given information about mediation. All of those proposals are intended to save saveable marriages. That indeed has been a major focus of debate. So I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister is fully

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
aware of the significance of what he is saying. Is he seriously suggesting that a couple who have been apart for five years—one of whom is wilfully refusing to divorce the other, causing one party to remain tied to the other for five years—must be required to wait another 12, 18 or 21 months under the Bill for the purpose of trying to save the marriage? That is absolutely absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, in those circumstances, transitional arrangements are needed to that the parties to the marriage do not suffer an inequity. Surely, it cannot be suggested that such a marriage is capable of being saved and that therefore there must be a further period for reflection and consideration. The parties have been reflecting on and considering the breakdown of their relationship for almost five years. It cannot be right for such people to remain in such circumstances for a longer period. How do hon. Members who value the sanctity of marriage justify its being made a mockery of in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a mockery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a marriage has been at an end for almost five years and someone has been deprived of a divorce because of the wilful failure—through spite, or otherwise—of the other party, is that person to be told to wait another 21, 18, 12 months, or indeed any further time at all, to reflect and consider that spite and venom just because of an accident of time? That cannot be right. It makes nonsense of the notion of justice in the dissolution of marriages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the upshot of what the Minister has just said is that, when the Bill comes into force, there will be a moratorium on divorce for 21 months? How many marriages will that decision affect? I am sorry to delay the Committee, but this is a very serious issue. If such a moratorium comes into force, many thousands of people could be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am clearly saying that we must set out the ground for divorce and that that ground for divorce must not be circumvented. The hon. Members for Brent, South and for Sherwood seem to be arguing that the Lord Chancellor should have powers to circumvent that ground. The Lord Chancellor has no intention of doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Lord Chancellor thinks it expedient to ensure that the courts equitably treat marriages that have broken down irretrievably—clearly, after five years of separation, that is so—the amendment should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there are cases—they are not so rare—in which women in their late 30s, who have been separated from their spouses for about five years, have found another partner whom they wish to marry and start a family, but the so-called biological clock is ticking and might deprive them of the opportunity of parenthood? In such cases, the Bill will be inequitable unless there are transitional arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite so. The Bill will not just deprive them of the opportunity of parenthood, but it will cause
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
children—if the biological clock continues to tick and the parties decide to have the child—to be born out of wedlock. Opposition Members believe that that cannot simply be swept under the carpet as something for which there should be no transitional arrangements. It is a significant matter. I do see how Conservative Members can view it with mirth or sanguinity, whether it is 10 minutes to 7 o'clock or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tabling the amendments, I was of the view that the Minister would say, "Of course, in such circumstances regulations will be laid down to stop the manifest injustice and dangers", which have been outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston). Such dangers are forthcoming—we cannot ignore parties whose marriage has irretrievably broken down for up to five years or for up to two years. We are not talking about cases in which there is not a margin of months; the whole point of giving the Lord Chancellor the powers to introduce transitional arrangements is that he can say whether the margin is 18 months or thereafter, or four years and six months or thereafter, and to act within that margin. What sort of advice has been given to Ministers on the impact of such legislation on the family and the institution of marriage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response confirms what Opposition Members—and I imagine, perhaps naively, what some Conservative Members—have always believed, namely, that the implications of the Bill have not been properly thought through and that there has been an unintended omission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the implications is that the lack of a transitional period will, rather than save marriages, cause a rush to divorce before the Bill is enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will see a rush to divorce—that will certainly happen. It is said that there is already a rush because of other aspects of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Couples will be driven to perjury. They will say, "We have already been separated for two years." A party who is desperate to be unshackled from an unreasonable partner after almost five years will say, "In fact, we have been separated for five years." In the month or two before the Bill is expected to be enacted, there will be a rush of petitions that do not have a sound or proper basis. It is wrong—indeed, it is unbelievable—that no consideration has been given to the introduction of transitional arrangements. It makes a nonsense of equity in matrimonial proceedings and in the law concerning the dissolution of marriages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful for the Committee to know that if a petition for divorce has been presented before the Bill is enacted, divorce proceedings will continue as under the existing law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Obviously", but it has been said that there would be a moratorium on divorce. Evidently, the divorces initiated before enactment will proceed. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman seems to be unaware of the decision taken
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>379</span>
by the Committee of the whole House. There is now a ground for divorce in which irretrievable breakdown is not established through the grounds that were previously presented. The hon. Gentleman says that people may be tempted to perjure themselves, but one of the reasons why the Government introduced the Bill is because of the concern that the many accusations—made by both sides—of unreasonable behaviour are clearly exaggerated. That is unhelpful, so we proposed—and the Committee of the whole House agreed—that the grounds should be one of irretrievable breakdown being established by a period for reflection. I have made it crystal clear in all my utterances that I do not believe that the period for reflection and consideration should be abridged, which is the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the thrust of the amendment; if it were, it would have been introduced as such. It must be clear that the purpose of the amendment is to create transitional arrangements so that justice is done. We want to avoid injustice. The amendment is not designed to abridge the period for reflection and consideration, but to give the parties whose marriage has already irretrievably broken down, by evidence of a protected length of time having elapsed since they lived separate and apart, the benefit of transitional arrangements that would allow them to be divorced in the ordinary way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, at the end of the transitional arrangements which, by definition, would not last very long, the law would apply as determined by Parliament. It would be unprecedented to have a law covering such matters under which there were no transitional arrangements. It would be a nonsense; it would make a mockery of the law and devalue the institution of marriage. Such a position would keep in operation a husk of a marriage and require an artificial exercise to be entered into by parties whose marriage had already irretrievably broken down by virtue of their being separate and apart for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what the Minister has said, we shall be pressing the amendment to a Division. We shall return to the issue on Report and make it widely known that the Government do not intend there to be any transitional arrangements under the Bill. The public can then judge the Bill, as we will—and the more that we know about the Bill, the less we like it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I wonder whether hon. Members have noticed that paragraph 1 of the schedule states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Chancellor may by order make such consequential modifications of any enactment or subordinate legislation as appear to him necessary or expedient in consequence of Part II in respect of",</p></blockquote>
followed by a long list, including virtually everything. It really is Henry VIII legislation with a vengeance. I wonder whether hon. Members have noticed that and whether my hon. Friend the Minister wishes to comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember referring to that point a little time ago and suggesting that there was a need for a consequential amendment. It is a drafting amendment and does not have the implications

suggested by my hon. Friend. I shall reassure him on that point on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I take this opportunity of thanking you and your colleague Sir Patrick Cormack, for chairing the Committee? Both of you kept us in great order during our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dealt with issues that have excited a substantial amount of high personal commitment in the Committee. I have served on Standing Committees when the most serious accusation has been that hon. Members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
spend their time signing their constituency correspondence or make very little contribution at all. All members of the Committee have made worthy and committed contributions and it has been a high advertisement for our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Clerk and the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters. I also thank my hon. Friend the Whip, who has done sterling service. I must also thank my colleagues for their contributions. At the beginning of our deliberations I was accused by one Opposition Member of starting off in combative mode and was called to order by him. I have not endeavoured to be combative, but I have noted that some of the contributions of other hon. Members have become more combative as our proceedings have unfolded. In dealing with those combative remarks, may I thank those who cannot be seen in the Committee at present?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the most telling contributions have been made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, drawing on his experience. I was very pleased that we on the Conservative Benches mentioned that earlier, rather than in the context of the valedictory remarks, which is an indication of the worthwhile and detailed nature—and cross-party nature—of many of the speeches that have been made, as should be the case in a Bill on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share with the Committee the information that perhaps the lowest point we reached was when my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle was unable to pronounce the name of the constituency of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I thought that was the moment when matters might take their ugliest turn. I can pronounce the name of the constituency of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy—and my mother comes from Gainsborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been humour in the Committee to go alongside the gravity of the issues that we have been discussing. I give the prize for the best humorous contribution to the hon. Member for Brent, South because I thought his remark about Henry VII was the best joke.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Custom, practice and courtesy demand that these valedictory utterances be made. We have heard them on numerous occasions-almost as often as we have heard from the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin), who sadly is not here, but who has not hesitated to share the breadth and length of his considerable experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We give our heartfelt thanks to you, Mr. O'Hara and to Sir Patrick, to the Clerk, to 	<i>Hansard</i> and to the unseen and unheard ones on all sides. It has been a particularly taxing Committee in more ways than one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman sits behind the Minister and has perhaps made things a little more taxing than the Minister might usually expect. Nevertheless, it has been a good Committee because we have done what we have been sent here to do. We have examined in some detail and with robust and independent minds the provisions of a Bill that has been put in our charge. We shall report back to the House and it is for the House to make of our deliberations and the Bill

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
what it may. Heartfelt thanks to you, Mr. O'Hara, to Sir Patrick and to all who have served the Committee during our deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I associate myself with those remarks sincerely? I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I must mention that during the episode between the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and the Minister, I was reminded of an old Welsh tradition that persists in my constituency—making home-made toffee. It has to be drawn very slowly but consistently. I was thinking about that at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara and your colleague, Sir Patrick. You have kept us in order and ensured that our business has gone ahead without undue delay. I have learnt a lot from serving on the Committee and I trust that we shall all bring further pressure to bear on Report. Finally, I add my thanks to those of both the Minister and the hon. Member for Brent, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the privilege of having the final word and want to say that I approached the Committee with a sense of anticipation. That is why you all found me sitting on the platform, not in the Chair, at the first meeting—I wanted to gauge the Committee's temperature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
I was aware that the Bill had been propelled into Committee with the momentum of an interesting debate in the House. Indeed, it commenced its proceedings with a dilatory motion. I knew that hon. Members on both sides not only had deep understanding and experience of the matters that we would debate, but a deep commitment to them. I expected to have to manage some lively debates, but, although the debates were lively, I owe my thanks to the Committee for the good humour—to which the Minister has referred—and for a commendable self-discipline which made my role as Chairman quite easy. I am sure that I speak for my co-Chairman, Sir Patrick Cormack, on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Clerk at my shoulder. No Chairman can manage without a Clerk, and this Clerk has been indispensible to me throughout. I also thank the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters and the attendants. Those who may not be seen or heard sometimes cause some trouble for the Chair, but they certainly caused me little trouble during this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has been an interesting experience. Happily, the content and quality of the debate made it one of the most interesting that I have chaired in my time on the Chairmen's panel. It was the quality and content of debate not, as I had thought, the quality of the interaction between both sides that made it so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
