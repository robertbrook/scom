<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be glad that I have not brought "Butterworths" with me today, although I have brought another little text with me, to which I might occasionally refer.<br><br>
The amendments demonstrate how self-assessment has proceeded in the past few years and substantiate Labour's case. Clause 115 amends the provisions for self-assessment in section 12B and schedule 1A of the Taxes Management Act 1970. Those provisions were inserted by schedule 19(3) of the Finance Act 1994, amended by section 105 of the Finance Act 1995 and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
are amended again by the Bill. We are now amending the amendments to the amendments, which shows where we have got to with the Bill. The Opposition do not object in principle to the Government amendments, but we should like some explanation of them.<br><br>
The self-assessment process has become something of a mess. We have had representations from various organisations that consider the amendments in the Bill and those tabled by the Government as problematic. I propose to set out clearly the way in which the Opposition believe the process will develop.<br><br>
Under amendment (a), an Inland Revenue officer could accept other documentary evidence, such as vouchers, as proof when original records of payment of overseas taxes through double taxation, for example, had been lost. No one wants to place extra burdens on business.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0429">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
A person who is liable to make a tax return for a tax year or accounting period must keep all the records that he needs to make a complete and correct return. A trader must do so for five years from 31 January following the tax year, and a company must do so for six years from the end of the accounting period. A non-trader must keep records for one year from 31 January following the tax year if the return is made on time or for one year from the end of the quarter day on which it was made if it is late.<br><br>
Under the existing wording of section 12B(4) of the Taxes Management Act 1970, copies of originals of the documents may be preserved. Failure to comply with record-keeping rules can result—under section 12B (5)—in a penalty of up to £3,000 regardless of whether any tax has been lost. A series of changes has been put forward by various legislation.<br><br>
Subsection (3) of the clause inserts a new section 12B (4A) which covers subsequent records. It is worthwhile setting out exactly what is proposed. New subsection (a) (i) amends the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 in respect of section 234 on dividend vouchers—statements of dividends and tax credits provided by companies when making distributions. New subsection (a) (ii) amends section 352 in respect of certificates of tax deducted on various provisions of the 1988 Act, such as donations to charities, annuities, annual payments, annual interest, building society interest, discretionary grants and so forth. New subsection (b) deals with payments to construction industry subcontractors; subsection (c) (i) with payments of foreign tax; and (c) (ii) with foreign tax deemed to have been paid on specific tax sparing agreements.<br><br>
Under sections 234 and 352 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, the taxpayer is required to provide a document only when the recipient so requests in writing. Notes on clauses admit that clause 115
<br><blockquote><p>"extends the rules for keeping records".</p></blockquote>
The proposed change was not, however, referred to in the Budget day press release from the Inland Revenue, document No. 24, on self-assessment.<br><br>
The Faculty of Taxation and the Institute of Taxation have questioned the need for retention of the original vouchers. The institute noted that the clause would cause
<br><blockquote><p>"a major compliance problem in practice"</p></blockquote>
and that it would be
<br><blockquote><p>"unworkable if the CREST system is adopted".</p></blockquote>
It recommends consultation so that requirements can be freely discussed with Inland Revenue. A similar point could be made about other documents specified under new section 12B (4)—for example, certificates of tax deducted at source, building society interest and so on.<br><br>
Government amendments Nos. 107 and 109 now seek to redress the problem of retaining dividend vouchers and tax deducted certificates. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
requirement to retain original records of foreign tax paid must, however, take into account the fact that the availability of such documents is dependent on the practices of the foreign tax authority, especially regarding the time taken to agree foreign tax liabilities. When foreign inquiries are made, several years may pass before appropriate records can be obtained. Does that mean that the original claim must leave out the foreign tax relief claim because the requisite record may not have been obtained by the filing date? The Minister should deal with that problem.<br><br>
The company would be required to amend its return within the next 12 months using appropriate procedure under section 11 AA (2) (b) of the 1970 Act, as inserted by section 82 of the Finance Act 1994, if information became available within that time. Even after 12 months, some foreign tax relief information may remain unavailable. In that case, self-assessment would seem to require that the company make a claim to error or mistake relief within five years of the filing date. That process will be far more bureaucratic and time-consuming than the current method of agreeing foreign tax relief.<br><br>
Labour amendment (a) to Government amendments Nos. 107 and 109 seek to probe the Government's view on the problem of record keeping generally and on claims not included in returns. Government amendment No. 109 requires that
<br><blockquote><p>"an officer of the Board is satisfied that any facts which he reasonably requires to be proved, and which would have been proved by the records, are proved by other documentary evidence furnished to him."</p></blockquote>
We believe that that is unnecessarily bureaucratic. The Minister may be able to explain why it is put in that way. Why not just provide that the record or other documentary evidence is acceptable? The words
<br><blockquote><p>"proved by other documentary evidence"</p></blockquote>
might allow individual officers to apply an overly high standard.<br><br>
The amendments also seem inconsistent with the general approach of schedule 19, which aims to remove provisions requiring an officer of the board to be satisfied that certain conditions exist. Labour amendment (b) to Government amendments Nos. 107 and 109 would lower the standard of documentary evidence required for records in general and for claims not included in returns by changing "proved by" to "supported by". The documentation, taken with the other circumstances perhaps known to the Inland Revenue officer, may be enough to satisfy the Inland Revenue. That officer may have dealt with a particular business over a long period and may know that it normally deals with its affairs in an exemplary manner. There may be insufficient documentation to prove the case, but enough, taken with the overall record of a business, to support it and to satisfy the Inland Revenue; in such circumstances we would all think that that documentation should be accepted. So "proved" seems to set an unnecessarily high standard, whereas "supported" would be sufficient to satisfy the Inland Revenue—it would not accept the evidence if it were not. Our amendment would allow the Inland Revenue to be satisfied that there was sufficient
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0430">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
documentation to satisfy it without requiring that extremely high standard of proof.<br><br>
Those are the areas that we seek to explore with the Minister. I hope that he can comment on them so that we can decide whether to press the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to make a brief intervention in this important but perhaps minor debate on an aspect of selfassessment—which could become a matter of great concern to our constituents. I preface my remarks by saying that it is wry and amusing to see the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) in his new role for new Labour as the taxpayer's friend; one is not used to that. Labour has tended to take the other side in such arguments. However, we always welcome the sinner who repenteth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Talking about sinners repenting, has the hon. Gentleman repented for having voted for the biggest tax rise in history in 1993?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure how relevant that is to the clause. I shall pretend the hon. Gentleman did not say it.<br><br>
To pass to the substance of my argument, I particularly welcome Government amendment No. 109 since it seems to contain much common sense and to offer some flexibility to hard-pressed taxpayers when faced with the documentary retention requirements of self-assessment. Those requirements will turn out to be considerable because such things tend to grow rather than diminish with the passage of time.<br><br>
Secondly, I welcome the spirit of subsection (5) of clause 115 which, I imagine, will remain in roughly its present form. It appears to be directed towards ensuring that there will be no retrospection in the documentary arrangements. That is much to be welcomed because had the clause contained a retrospective element, it would have offended many people and caused considerable extra costs for businesses and other taxpayers.<br><br>
Thirdly, can my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, who I imagine will reply to the debate, clarify two points? First, is the purpose of subsection (3) of clause 115 to ensure that tax paid or payable in other jurisdictions around the world, including in what are commonly known as tax havens, be taken fully into account in the requirements for documentary retention?<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Secondly, I believe that it is customary for the Inland Revenue to expect taxpayers to keep their relevant records for six years prior to the tax year in question. Does that rule also apply to the clause and, if so, what is the main justification for applying it to information which could well be derived from other jurisdictions where there may not be a six-year rule?<br><br>
Despite those two queries, I broadly support the intentions of the Government amendments as well as the broad intention of the clause.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Minister replies, I have three questions, one very basic; I am sure that I have misread something somewhere. Why do we appear to be inserting new subsections (3A) and (3B) after new subsection (4A) of the Taxes Management Act 1970? It seems unusual to reverse the order in that way—at least, I have not understood the logic.<br><br>
Secondly, and rather more importantly, how does my hon. Friend envisage that the new system for a paperless transfer in the stock exchange—the new CREST system—will impact on taxpayers' ability to maintain records? There might be some concern among taxpayers who own shares about the clause's implications for them under self-assessment once we move into a world of paperless transfer in which people will not have share certificates either at home or in their banks. It is very important that such people be reassured on that point. I am sure that the Government have given some thought to that and I hope that my hon. Friend can address it.<br><br>
Finally, under subsection (3)(c), the taxpayer is obliged to hold
<br><blockquote><p>"any such record as may be requisite for making a … claim"</p></blockquote>
in respect of taxation which has been paid abroad on securities that are held abroad. Will my hon. Friend tell us what the Revenue practice will be on that? As he knows, it is normal in many overseas jurisdictions—not just in tax havens as referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman)—for a local bank to act as custodian and repository of the shares. Normally, the only record that the taxpayer in Britain would have of his dividend income or of the tax that has been deducted locally, would be the securities or bank statements that he received. Would it be adequate for a taxpayer to retain copies of a bank statement from his French or German bank—or, in the case cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington, from a bank in a rather more exotic location—or does my hon. Friend the Minister envisage that taxpayers will be required to hold an additional form of documentation? The current wording is not enormously precise and I can imagine that it might give rise to concern for taxpayers who hold overseas shares.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good Morning, Mr. Hill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington said, we have arrived at a somewhat bizarre position, in which one might suppose that one was looking through the looking glass. The Government included in the Bill a clause entitled "Retention of Original Records". That retention is required to ensure that self-assessment works properly and that taxpayers keep the records needed to support their claims.<br><br>
Representations about the clause were then made by bodies representing taxpayers' interests, such as the Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants, to the effect that the clause is in some respects too onerous. They also claim that some of its provisions are unnecessary and could be achieved in another way, with less of a burden on taxpayers.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
However, along comes the hon. Member for North Warwickshire and says, "I don't think the Bill goes far enough. The taxpayer needs a bit more relief." The hon. Gentleman appears not to be worried about whether the Inland Revenue can do its job and achieve its objective. It is certainly an extraordinary U-turn and reversal of role by the Labour Front Bench Treasury team compared with only two or three years ago; nor is it any old taxpayer that Labour Members want to help. Clause 115 (3)(c) refers to tax
<br><blockquote><p>"which has been paid under the laws of a territory outside the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
Not many small business operating only in this country pay taxes outside the United Kingdom, so it appears to be big business and big taxpayers that Labour Members are so keen to support. [Hon. Members: "New Labour."' Is it a result of new Labour's assault on the prawn cocktail circuit? I do not know, but I think that we should be told.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise not to plead on behalf of any taxpayer, but to protect the rights of the citizen. As I said last year, I have paid taxes under other regimes where the self-assessment system operated, so I am not opposed to that system in principle. I cannot see, however, how the extraordinary complexity of our tax raising system, which involves the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise and which in parts dates back more than 400 or 500 years, can combine with the simplicity that should be inherent in self-assessment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire has tabled amendments to the Government amendments to clause 115. I urge the Financial Secretary to look seriously at the amendments to the Chief Secretary's amendments, as they tilt the balance slightly in favour of the citizen and away from the Revenue. As the self-assessment system has been constructed, the Inland Revenue has arrogated to itself powers from which previously it was—sensibly—kept distant. Up to now, the Inland Revenue has had to go through a clear legal process before being able to start to delve deeply into a citizen's private affairs.<br><br>
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire do not favour big business, which has a battery of accountants who can negotiate well. They can find the loopholes which, despite the best work of the Government and the Committee, always emerge from the Finance Bill process, and thus protect their own interests. One only has to look at News International, which paid some £11 million tax last year on £958 million profit, to see the power that good accountants can give to big corporations. However, I am more worried about the 3,000 or 4,000 small firms in my constituency of Rotherham that cannot afford to employ an accountant or are possibly not even sure whether they can afford to pay the honorariums of a professional accountant and which may rely, at best, on an unqualified independent financial adviser.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
Even as amended by the Chief Secretary, clause 115 tilts power towards the Revenue and would put more responsibility on the taxpayer to prove that he or she is an honest person. The amendment that was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire, which would replace the word "proved" with the word "supported", is helpful. Proof is a technical and legally precise term, whereas the term "supported" would allow greater leeway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting point and I am trying to follow his argument. Does not the issue depend on whether the burden of proof is criminal or civil? Civil proof relies on the balance of probability if the matter were ever to go to court; criminal proof has to be beyond all reasonable doubt, which might be almost impossible for a taxpayer to achieve in court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman opens up a vista of a new paradise, not only for accountants and independent financial advisers, but for that other wonderful closed shop, which has been left untouched in the past 16 years—the lawyers' cartel. I can see them eagerly embracing the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the Leader of the Opposition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about English lawyers—Scottish advocates are wholly different. In fact, I am talking about English banisters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Keep digging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to say that from time to time there arises from the lawyers' cartel one who speaks the truth and shines a light. The speech of my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire contained such light-shining, truth-guiding suggestions for the Government.<br><br>
Last week's events have highlighted the great distrust that the British public feel for a state that refuses, through its Executive—its Ministers and senior civil servants—to accept responsibility for its actions. Since last Thursday, we have seen a remarkable defence of Executive powers and amazing contempt for the clear wishes of this country's citizens that Ministers should accept their responsibilities in all matters that are connected with the discharge of their public duties.<br><br>
I feel that to continue on this path of selfassessment—to a certain extent, I repeat what I said last year—will open up a nightmare of difficulties for scores of small businesses and, in due course, individuals. I urge members of the Committee to take the issue very seriously indeed. Not enough thought has been given to the matter. Will the Financial Secretary accept that small attenuation away from the Executive in the direction of the citizen by accepting amendment (b) to amendment No. 107?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a splendid start to the debate.

The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) made an impassioned plea on behalf of those whom he sees as being affected by self-assessment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire began the debate and he wanted to go much wider than the amendments allow us. He wanted to tell us that the Revenue's thorough and meticulous planning for self-assessment, which is replicated in the clauses and the amendments that we have tabled, was deficient because we are now having to make further amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) may be interested to know that we listen carefully to what people say to us, because we want self-assessment to be right on the night. From the flavour of this amendment and others that we shall consider this morning, I get the feeling that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire may have been a fly on the wall at the self-assessment consultative committee. Throughout the planning process for self-assessment, we gathered the views of representative bodies of people whose business it is to deal with tax matters on behalf of taxpayers and companies. They are right to criticise us if we are not doing our job properly and to make suggestions if there are better ways to approach problems.<br><br>
At the heart of the amendments is a proposition that deals with the fundamental question of record keeping. To hear Opposition Members, one would think that keeping records was a brand new imposition on the taxpayer suddenly dreamt up for self-assessment. I think that everyone in this room is a taxpayer: certainly all hon. Members are and I imagine that every year they have to keep a record of official documents to justify the information that they give to the Revenue under the current arrangements.<br><br>
Using common sense, we have sought to transfer the current arrangements to a system of self-assessment. The fundamental difference with self-assessment is that it puts the taxpayer in the driving seat, which is good. The taxpayer can base his self-assessment on his perception of his tax affairs and on his records, year in and year out. If he wants to know how much tax he will have to pay, he has to assume responsibility for the accuracy of the statements that he makes.<br><br>
Our amendment recognises that human frailty may play a part in record keeping. Someone who keeps his tax records may lose an original document. Such documents may be pieces of paper that are effectively worth money, such as the vouchers relating to the receipt of a dividend from a company, which tell the Revenue that tax has been paid on that dividend. People will have to justify their self-assessment by supplying a piece of paper that says that they have paid tax on the dividend declared on their tax return. It is, therefore, an important document.<br><br>
We were specific in clause 115, but we recognise human frailty and, as a result of our consultations with the self-assessment consultative committee, we have introduced an amendment dealing with lost documents. If, by any chance, a person has lost an original document, the inspector can ask him to show,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
in some other sensible way, that the tax has been paid on the amount in the self-assessment. If he can provide the inspector with a building society book, for example, or with further information or even with a replacement document from the building society or the company that has issued the original share dividend certificate, it is highly likely that the inspector will be totally satisfied with that alternative form of proof. We were anxious to introduce that provision in our amendments.<br><br>
The Opposition, in their amendments to Government amendments Nos. 107 and 109, play to the tune that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) described. If the amendment of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire is taken to extremes, it could mean—and he has offered us no evidence to the contrary—that virtually any type of evidence could be produced. Would a scrap of paper, the back of an envelope or something plucked off the kitchen shelf be acceptable? I do not know because the hon. Gentleman does not tell us. He simply gives a general idea. Bearing in mind the fact that our proposal is a response to consultation with those whose task is to criticise, I put it to my right hon. and hon. Friends that our amendment is sensible and the Opposition's amendment is not.<br><br>
The Opposition's other amendment, on records for double taxation, demonstrates that they do not understand the clause. Again, the self-assessment consultative committee spoke of the greater flexibility given by the relevant words on a looser requirement for double taxation agreements. We recognise that there may be documentary problems; that is why the clause is phrased as it is and is a model of flexibility that recognises the practical problems in that area. The consultative committee asked if we could apply similar flexibility to the domestic situation and that is why we tabled the amendment. We have moved down the road of excellence by responding to representations in our amendments; under the terms of the double tax requirements, we were told that if we stipulated that any record necessary to make a correct and complete return should be provided, that would ensure the necessary flexibility. Records could well be in the form that my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) outlined—bank statements and so on. They must be recognisable records.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked me about tax havens. As a point of detail, I can tell him that part of the clause applies to those areas where we have double taxation agreements. For obvious reasons, tax havens are by and large not so advantaged by that, which deals with the point raised by my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend also asked me about the length of time for which records should be kept. Businesses will be required to maintain their records for a six-year period but individuals for 22 months, during which the self-assessment is open to amendment or discussion by the Inland Revenue; once that period is over, the self-assessment is closed on both sides. So that deals with the question of records.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding asked me several specific questions. On the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0433">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
ordering of clauses, he has the advantage because I have not been able to study that, but my advice is that that is in order. I will, however, re-examine them in the light of his probing question. Should I need to respond further, I will come back to him. He also asked about the age of electronics in the world of shares. As my friend the Economic Secretary advises me, there will ultimately be printed copies of such transactions as CREST, which will help those who need to keep appropriate records.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us whether electronic accounting will extend to accountants' working papers and to their computerised records and notes on their clients' financial activities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must listen; if he has been listening, he has not understood, in which case I apologise for my lack of clarity. As I explained, in the case of individuals we are dealing with tax vouchers and our amendments to clause 115 give the flexibility to provide alternative records in the case of an inquiry about the substantiveness of records. Clearly, if accountants have records that can satisfy an inspector about a client's affairs it is for the inspector to make a judgment. These are occasions on which people make inquiries. By and large, the Inland Revenue is experienced in individual taxpayers' affairs. It compares and contrasts each person's assessment with a previous position, and inquiries usually take place only if the Revenue questions a substantial change in a taxpayer's affairs.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with the questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding. I ask Conservative Members to support the Government amendments and to reject those tabled by the Opposition. The Government, after careful consultation, have moved to a more flexible position as regards the individual. Clause 115 as drafted respects the difficulties in the world of double taxation by giving a more flexible approach, and the Government amendments borrow from that thesis. The Opposition's amendment adopts a sloppy approach to the important matter of keeping simple and straightforward records which can justify a person's tax position to the Revenue.<br><br>
I invite Conservative Members to reject the Opposition's amendments and support the Government's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to move amendments (b) to Government amendments Nos. 107 and 109. I also wish to say a few words in reply to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that you wish to move those amendments formally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reply to some of the comments made by the Financial Secretary in respect of those amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason why you should not.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Hill. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield raised the question of overseas tax records. His speech surprised us, as it seemed to be subtitled "All Power to the Inland Revenue, Forget About the Taxpayer". Coming from the hon. Gentleman, that is very sad, as he has championed simplicity in taxation and in many ways has been a force for good in this Committee in the past.<br><br>
I should like to explain to the hon. Gentleman the role of Opposition—a role to which he will have to get used if he remains in the House after the next general election. The Opposition have a twofold role: first, to propose alternatives and suggest what should be done with tax and with the law in general; secondly, to test what the Government do. Part of our job is to test out and pursue questions raised by people outside the House about what the Government have done and how they have done it.<br><br>
In relation to overseas tax records, we are testing the Minister's arguments to see if they stand up. Records of foreign tax paid can take several years to come through, as I have said, and it is important that the Minister places on record a description of how that can be handled. To some extent, I accept that he has done that.<br><br>
The central question—and one that the Labour party constantly emphasises—is to do with fairness and unfairness in taxation. It is not so much a question of whether big business or small business is involved: it is a question of whether the tax system is fair and works effectively for everyone. We want businesses both large and small to prosper under a fair tax regime. Over many years we have been anxious about the unfairness in the tax regime imposed by the Government. The Committee's job is to ensure that the Bill strikes the proper balance between the individual and the Inland Revenue, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham said. The Inland Revenue should not have unfettered power over the taxpayer, and the taxpayer should be able to put his case properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is the Opposition's job to test and of course we all want the tax system to be fair. My point was, however, that if the Government had introduced such a relieving provision two or three years ago, the Oppostion would have leapt up and said, "Ah, a tax avoider's charter." We now find, however, that the provisions do not go far enough and that the taxpayer receives insufficient relief.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the great dangers in politics is that one believes one's own propaganda. The hon. Gentleman has for too long believed the propaganda about the Labour party that has emanated from Central Office. He does not see the reality of the modern Labour party, which speaks, as it always has done, for fairness in taxation. It speaks for the individual and the people.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
The Financial Secretary has not convinced me or my hon. Friends that Government amendment No. 107 will operate satisfactorily. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"After subsection (5A) of that section there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>`(5B) Subsection (5) above also does not apply where— … an officer of the Board is satisfied that any facts which he reasonably requires to be proved, and which would have been proved by the records, are proved"</p></blockquote>
"supported according to our amendment—
<br><blockquote><p>"by other documentary evidence furnished to him.".</p></blockquote>
There is still a requirement that the Inland Revenue be satisfied—proof is still required. Amendment (b) gives the Inland Revenue the discretion to decide whether the proof is available. The Government remove that discretion and require that proof be produced on the balance of probability that a certain level of documentation is available. Documentation may, however, be unavailable for good reasons, and the Inland Revenue may accept that. According to the Government, however, it must be available otherwise no one can do anything, even though everyone knows the facts.<br><br>
That is neither logical nor sensible, and we have, therefore, tabled amendments (b) to amendments No. 107 and 109. This is a question not simply of the balance between the individual and the Inland Revenue, but of the balance of common sense. We should not get into a situation in which the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue want something that is entirely reasonable and fully supported by the documents but which the law prevents them from having.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just used different words. He said that the evidence should be "fully supported" by documents; the amendment, however, says "supported". That puts the taxpayer in an inherently weak position, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary implied. The hon. Gentleman cannot play fast and loose with the English language. The law has to be carefully drafted, and we must choose the correct verbs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may think that he has a point, but he almost plays into our hands. I shall read the amendment to him again. It says that where
<br><blockquote><p>"an officer of the Board is satisfied that any facts which he reasonably requires to be proved"—</p></blockquote>
again, we have not taken that "proved" out—
<br><blockquote><p>"and which would have been proved by the records"—</p></blockquote>
the officer must, therefore, be aware of that—
<br><blockquote><p>"are supported by other documentary evidence".</p></blockquote>
The word "fully" occurs in the earlier part of the section, which must be taken as a whole. Once one does that, one can understand what we want. The proof does not have to be in the documentation because it may be in the surrounding circumstances—the fact that the Revenue knows that a particular company can be relied on to carry out its procedures properly. If it is a business that is known by the Inland Revenue to be unreliable, the Revenue will not accept the sufficient proof. We want to insert that element of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
discretion which can make the tax system work effectively for the individual and for the Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the hon. Gentleman will admit—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire gave way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the facts are already in the knowledge of the Inland Revenue, for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave, why does it need to seek further documentary proof? The matter would not arise if the Inland Revenue were satisfied in the course of its regular knowledge of that taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause requires that the matter be proved. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion is almost what we would achieve by inserting the word "supported". We would insert an element of discretion for the Inland Revenue. The hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that the word "proved" includes that element of discretion, so we do not need to change the wording. However, the Financial Secretary takes the opposite view—he said that he is proposing a much higher standard of requirement than we say is necessary, reasonable or sensible when the Inland Revenue and the individual can both come to an agreement about providing sufficient information to satisfy an officer of the board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to trouble members of the Committee again, but I cannot let the remarks of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire go without further observations. I was thumbing through <i>Hansard</i>—as one does—in preparation for the debate, and I found these words of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire, spoken on 25 January 1996:
<br><blockquote><p>"Once some people get the message that fraud can escape detection, confidence in the system will be undermined."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 512.]</p></blockquote>
That was in a debate on this issue at the beginning of the year, and the hon. Member for North Warwickshire nods, because he knows that those were his words. For his greater refreshment of memory, I shall also quote the words of the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We need an assurance that a thorough-going monitoring process will apply to as many returns as possible. If implementation goes wrong, self-assessment will turn into a tax-avoidance industry."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 28 February 1995; c. 509–10.]</p></blockquote>
Thus, earlier this very year the colleagues of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire were on to that very point. The hon. Gentleman seeks to undermine his hon. Friends and even himself by his line today.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman put the point about proof at the heart of his argument. As I see his amendment, an officer making an inquiry would, under the hon. Gentleman's terms, effectively have to say to the taxpayer, "I am satisfied that you have something that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0435">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
supports your claim." That something is vague and ill-defined. Under the Government's more flexible arrangements, the officer can say, after he has seen alternative documentary proof, "I am satisfied that you, the taxpayer, have proved your claim."<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of self-assessment. It is about a taxpayer assessing his liabilities to tax and therefore being able to demonstrate, if asked whether what he has written on the form is correct, that he has the necessary simple records so to do. Nothing could be more straightforward and I commend our amendment to the Committee.</span></p>

It sums up the faulty processes in the Bill.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
11.30 am<br><br>
Let me make the position of the Labour party clear. In principle, we support self-assessment. We always have done so because we see it as a way forward, but we also acknowledge the complexity and difficulties that need to be resolved. The Government and Inland Revenue have been trying to put in place a system of self-assessment that will work. That is obviously what they are doing and to that extent we can support them. However, we feel that it is being rushed. As I have already said, the clause demonstrates that. It is worth repeating that to make the point as forcefully as possible. The clause amends schedule 1A and section 12B of-the Taxes Management Act 1970, which were inserted by schedule 19(3) of the Finance Act 1994. Those provisions had to be amended again in the Finance Act 1995 and are being amended again in the Bill. The Government are obviously feeling their way forward, trying to get self-assessment right.<br><br>
I accept that there has been some consultation, but despite all that, we have not yet reached the stage that was referred to in Inland Revenue press release No. 24, issued on 28 November 1995. It was then suggested that the Bill was about clarifying and simplifying the rules on calculation and modifying how relief is given. But it is not that simple. We are dealing with fundamental issues that should have been addressed before we started to rush forward with the Bill.<br><br>
Labour Members want self-assessment to succeed, as I have said, but we believe that it must have the confidence of those who have to operate it. It will not gain that confidence if the rules are so complex that they cannot be understood. It looks as though the Government have not got their act together early enough. We said on Second Reading that provisions should be delayed for a further year to enable the Government to do that. The Government are not prepared to do so because they believe that they have got their act together. Yet they believed that last year and the year before: we can now see that they have not. The fact that they are bringing forward amendments on self-assessment now proves it.<br><br>
That is not good enough. It is an important and complex matter. The Government are more concerned about getting rid of 3,000 jobs in Inland Revenue and saving some money than they are about getting self-assessment right. If we rush through the provisions, we will place unnecessary burdens on 9 million self-employed people and undermine the whole process of creating confidence in self-assessment. I repeat that we have consistently taken the view that a phased and more measured approach is the way forward.<br><br>
The Government have made the same mistake before. They did it with the Child Support Agency. That was a good idea in principle but it was rushed through as a cost-saving bonus and the implementation went horribly wrong.<br><br>
The clause proposes an enormous change to the tax system. Ernst and Young suggests that it is the biggest change in our tax system since the introduction of income tax. Such an enormous change must be got
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
right. We are worried that its implementation could go horribly wrong.<br><br>
The impact of self-assessment will become obvious to taxpayers when the envelopes flood through letterboxes and land on doormats a few days before a probable general election in May 1997.1 canvassed by telephone the companies in my constituency—an exercise well worth doing as it gave me a chance to ask clerks, accountants, managers and people who run their own businesses about what they had heard about self-assessment.<br><br>
To be fair to the Government, there have been a number of advertisements—I read one in a national newspaper the other day—in which the Government have tried to flag up the idea. However, most people are worried and confused about the proposal, as they have every reason to be. The Government are still tabling amendments to amendments in this Bill, so it is not surprising that people trying to work out their approach to the problem are getting confused. People are bound to be confused by the state that the proposals are in.<br><br>
My survey showed that really only the larger businesses in my constituency feel able to get to grips with the proposals. Such businesses employ full-time accountants who can say with a degree of confidence that they understand the proposals. I am not sure whether that confidence is misplaced as they will not yet have seen all the proposals. My survey revealed that most small businesses, especially those involving one self-employed trader, do not know what is about to hit them.<br><br>
Many people will have to employ an accountant for the first time in their lives. There are 1.5 million self-employed people who do not have accountants. To some extent, the proposal is a job creation measure for accountants. There are a number of accountants in the Committee. They may vote for the measure in the belief that it is a wonderful job creation scheme for their profession, but that is not what the Government are supposed to be about. It is vital to ensure that the burden on the individual taxpayer and on business is kept to the minimum that is necessary.<br><br>
To give people confidence in the process of self-assessment we must reduce the complexity involved and ensure that there are no headlines in The Sun about people not understanding how it works. We have received many representations from small businesses and it is worth reading the views of the British Retail Consortium. They are set out clearly in a letter that was sent to me by Tom Muir, the consortium's professional services director. The letter provides a good summary of the problems that people foresee, and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the feedback from our members, as a substantial body of employers who employ 2.1 million people, is that the Inland Revenue are not geared up to administering the new regime".</p></blockquote>
That is a very worrying view. The letter goes on to state that
<br><blockquote><p>"considerable problems, such as uncertainties of interpretation, will arise from administering this radical new regime".</p></blockquote>
The new regime is radical, as we have heard. The amendments that are coming up show the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0437">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
uncertainties that there will be over interpretation. We saw an example of that when the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and I discussed an interpretation of the legislation. How on earth are the self-employed to come to grips with such complexity?<br><br>
The British Retail Consortium says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Revenue have not … provided adequate relevant material for employers to brief employees; employees will be bound to look at their employers for help with self-assessment and it is unfair for employers to be put in the position of unofficial and unpaid tax advisers; retailers, therefore, are urging the Inland Revenue to give urgent and fresh consideration to finding means to alleviate problems from self assessment, whether by delaying implementation until 1997/98 or by other means."</p></blockquote>
That is the view of business: it has been repeatedly put and the Government should take account of it. Great concern has been expressed. Accountancy companies have begun to see the potential and are trying to obtain business. American accountancy companies have set up as high street tax advisers—such as there are in America—to deal with self-assessment. Reputable British accountancy firms, such as Cooper Lancaster Brewers, have produced special packages and have sought to benefit from the new arrangements.<br><br>
I have no objection to business providing a service: it looks like it will be necessary for many people. But will it be an extra burden? Are we not just transferring the burden from the Inland Revenue to business? It can be argued that that is what self-assessment does. If so, it is important that it be done in a way that reduces complexity, eases burdens and facilitates access to the rules for the preparation of tax returns.<br><br>
There is another worrying problem. If companies set themselves up as high street advisers and try to find their way through the complexities of clause 115 and the various amendments to amendments, they may think that they know more than they do. They may set themselves up as tax advisers when they are not properly qualified. That raises the issue of regulation of high street traders who put themselves forward as people able to advise small business. They are often ill-qualified and they may be charlatans. The small business person in particular may be done out of his money and may be in trouble with the Inland Revenue. That is an important consideration, given the substantial fines and the surcharges for getting things wrong.<br><br>
The Federation of Small Businesses and others have expressed great concern about the way in which the system will operate. The current arrangements for self-assessment will operate to the detriment of those who want to prepare their business for it. We are extremely worried not just about the complexity of clause 115, but about the process of moving from previous year to current year assessment. That raises questions about the contents of page 112 of the 1996–97 Red Book and the arguments behind them. We think that the measure will provide the Government with an interest-free loan at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer. That is not on, it is not right. Nevertheless, the Government are intent upon going ahead with it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
The Government have made a number of arguments in response to our points. I want to take each of them in turn and see if they stand up to logic. On 3 January 1996, the Financial Secretary wrote to <i>The Independent</i> about the complexity of self-assessment and the way in which it will operate. It was in response to an article entitled "The Answers to Your Tax Questions" and the Minister argued that the article's criticism of the Government was unjustified. I shall run through some of the points he made in that letter because it is important that we get clauses such as 115 right.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
He began by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Self assessment is a major modernisation of tax administration".</p></blockquote>
The Government's proposals simply largely transfer the burden of administration from the Inland Revenue to the taxpayer. John Whiting, head of personal tax at Price Waterhouse, was quoted as saying in <i>The Financial Times</i> on 4 January:
<br><blockquote><p>"The present system for dealing with income tax, other than by PAYE, has been famously described as a 'Rolls Royce' compared to the methods used by other countries … What we are getting is more like one of those cars that come in a kit… The only thing that's fast about [self assessment] is the speed of the penalties if the job isn't done on time."</p></blockquote>
That is the view of a senior tax accountant at Price Waterhouse.<br><br>
The next sentence of the Financial Secretary's letter reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has been thoroughly and fully debated in Parliament in the 1994 and 1995 Finance Bills".</p></blockquote>
That is ludicrous. Those Bills were among the largest and most overloaded ever considered by Parliament, yet only a few weeks were available in which to debate them. The self-assessment clauses in the Bills were badly presented—that is why we are amending them—and the debates tackled little more than the main concepts. If the Financial Secretary's comment were true, why have the Government had to table so many amendments this year to provisions that were supposedly "thoroughly and fully debated" in 1994 and 1995? Clause 112, for example, represents the Government's third attempt to get section 8 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 right. That section sets out the obligation to file a tax return and is a fundamental part of the self-assessment system. If the Government cannot get that right the first or even the second time, how can we have confidence in the rest of the legislation?<br><br>
The Financial Secretary's letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"when, in fact, it was actually welcomed in principle by Labour."</p></blockquote>
Labour welcomes the principle but deplores the hurried, bungled and incompetent way in which the system is being pushed through. That is a logical position for Labour because we want the system to work but do not think that the Government are going about it properly. Taking the Financial Secretary's letter sentence by sentence, the next reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Since then the changes concerned have been the subject of a massive consultation and public information exercise on which all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0438">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
sectors of the business community have been fully and continuously involved."</p></blockquote>
What evidence does the Government have that the massive consultation has been effective? Will the Government release full details of the consultation, including the names of the organisations consulted, the questions asked, the answers given and the actions taken in response to those questions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the main evidence of the results of consultation the very changes that the hon. Gentleman has been complaining about? The Government have consulted all the business organisations and they have made representations. Consequently, changes were introduced to last year's Finance Act and to the Bill, but the hon. Gentleman complains and says that the Government did not get it right the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have read to the Committee a letter from one of the many organisations already concerned that the level of consultation has been inadequate. We are dealing with people who employ 2.1 million and they say that the consultation has been inadequate and that representations have not been heeded. We have had many representations from the Institute of Taxation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Society about inadequacies and bad drafting in the Bill.<br><br>
I accept that the Government have undertaken a consultation process to some extent, but they have not been prepared fully to disclose all the information involved in that consultation. Moreover, that consultation is not yet complete. It is clear that several organisations still have serious concerns and that, because we are still dealing with amendments to amendments, we have not reached the stage where we should be putting proposals into legislation. A full consultation process should have occurred during the past two years so that we could have produced more detailed legislation either this year or next. When such a big change as that proposed in clause 115 is to be made, it is important that it be done properly. Our point is that the evidence of whether it has been done properly simply does not exist.<br><br>
What evidence do the Government have that the public information exercise has been effective? The television advertisements have raised awareness, but have they provided any true information? What was the reaction to the video for the self-employed? What evidence do the Government have that the self-assessment booklets have been effective? What plans do the Government have to inform taxpayers directly? Will information be included with this year's tax returns?<br><br>
If the business community has been fully and continuously involved, why do the CBI, the Institute of Directors and others raise concerns? In the <i>Financial Times</i> on 4 February the CBI stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"We anticipate that when self-assessment begins, employees are going to run to the payroll officer and cry for help."</p></blockquote>
Philip Davis of Ernst and Young wrote in <i>Accountancy</i> Age on 11 January:
<br><blockquote><p>"If only the Revenue had listened to the results of the consultation exercise properly, it would have been a different
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
story. As it is, they have put through what they wanted and now everything is looking a bit shaky."</p></blockquote>
He added that the Revenue had had plenty of opportunity to get self-assessment right but had ignored the profession's views and that, as a result, the system would be chaotic. That is in nobody's interests.<br><br>
Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton also wrote in <i>Accountancy Age</i> on 11 January:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am very concerned about staffing cuts in advance of self assessment. It is as though the Revenue are burning their boats. The Leicester trial last year showed just how many mistakes there could be. It is just a foretaste of what is to come."</p></blockquote>
Mavis Sargent of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants is also quoted in <i>Accountancy Age</i> as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Frankly, I take all the Revenue's claims about 'better and simpler' with a very large pinch of salt. In the short term the new system will need more staff rather than less, otherwise the taxpayer will be short-changed.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It ought to be possible for taxpayers to look to the Revenue for help in completing their forms, but they won't have the staff to do this.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I think they ought to have a dedicated help desk and I don't mean just computational assistance, but this will not happen. I'm afraid I have become extremely cynical about this."</p></blockquote>
Has the Revenue listened to its staff? Bill Hawkes, who is the secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Only about half of the staff in offices handling self assessment will even have access to the computer system … In addition, the system's functionality continues to be drawn downwards … The Revenue continue to demand much more for much less. I know from our staff that EDS [the US firm contracted to run the Revenue's computer systems] have had to tell the Revenue that they will be unable to meet some deadlines or meet all their expectations if budgets continue to be cut."</p></blockquote>
A survey that was reported in the <i>Quarterly Record</i> of the Association of H M Inspectors of Taxes in October 1995 found that 63 per cent. of fully trained officers who worked in the Revenue's office structure thought that it was not the right platform on which to introduce self-assessment successfully. Some 48 per cent. disagreed with the statement that the new office arrangements would improve compliance, and 13 per cent. disagreed strongly. A further 41 per cent. disagreed with the statement that the new office arrangements would improve customer services, and 30 per cent. disagreed strongly.<br><br>
Why was involvement in the consultation process limited to the business community? Ordinary taxpayers will also have to file returns. Why were they not involved more? I turn now to the rest of the Government's comments. The Financial Secretary's letter continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"As far as the amount of tax is concerned, there will be no hidden taxes. No double tax bills and no tax bombshells. The tax paid by business will be no more and no less than that due on the profits earned. The Red Book does indeed show that there will be an increase in business tax receipts expected in 1998–99. This is because of two factors: rising business profitability".</p></blockquote>
That is irrelevant. Rising business profitability affects all business taxes, but the Red Book does not show increased corporation tax yield, for example, as a Budget measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a good reason the Red Book does not show an increase in corporation tax profits—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
the basis for the assessment of corporation tax is not being changed. Only schedule D taxpayers will be moved from a previous year to a current year basis. A block of taxable profits will be brought forward, which accounts for the amount that is shown in the Red Book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are being paid early. The measures mean that taxpayers will pay more money than they would have expected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raised that specific point when we last discussed the matter and in correspondence with the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). Does the hon. Member for North Warwickshire agree that an individual business with level profits will pay no more each January and July under self-assessment than it would have done had self-assessment not existed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The measures will lead to a permanent increase in each year's yield when profits are rising. While the increase will be matched by a reduction in 1999 to 2000, the yield in that year will be increased by the tax that is pulled forward from the year 2000 to 2001. The Minister's letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, the self employed will still have up to 20 months after they have earned the profits to pay their final tax bill once they receive their tax forms for completion."</p></blockquote>
They will, however, pay a higher amount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the amount of tax that is paid on a given level of profit will not be altered by self-assessment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the Minister has condemned himself. His letter speaks of
<br><blockquote><p>"bringing forward the moment when the tax bill has to be paid."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that. He makes the point that the measures will bring forward the moment when the tax bill has to be paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish my point. The Red Book sets the situation out clearly, and the Minister should read it—he is supposed to have had a part in writing it. It clearly says that £850 million will be brought forward. In effect, the Government are bringing forward the tax that people will have to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simple question that I asked was, did the hon. Gentleman agree or did he not agree with the proposition that for a given level of profit, the amount of tax that a business will pay will not be affected by self-assessment. Does he agree or disagree?</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have stored up for the self-employed and for business a tax bombshell. Page 112 of the Red Book shows that. The Minister's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
letter to the editor of <i>The Independent</i> says that the Government are using self-assessment as a way of
<br><blockquote><p>"bringing forward the moment when the tax bill has to be paid."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words with which the Minister has hanged himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the cock that croweth three times will I not be denied. I will ask the hon. Gentleman the question again. Does he agree or disagree with the proposition that for a given level of profit, a company will not pay any more tax as a result of the introduction of self-assessment—yes or no?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not agree that he has said, clearly and in writing—it is the noose by which the Government and himself are hanging—that the Government are
<br><blockquote><p>"bringing forward the moment when the tax bill has to be paid"?</p></blockquote>
I can quote that for as long as the Minister asks questions. The Minister himself must answer my question because he has failed properly to explain his proposals to the self-employed and to small businesses. The Red Book exposes it clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend can address two worries of mine. First, a large number of small firms will have to pay extra money in the form of fees to enable them to handle self-assessment, because of its complexity. That will be an onerous burden on the money that such firms keep to invest in their business.<br><br>
Secondly, my hon. Friend may care to know that as I earn a modest amount as a journalist—a maximum of £2,000 a year, well below the minimum level that was suggested by Nolan—my accountant has advised me to send in an amount in advance of what I will earn in 1996 to satisfy the Revenue under the new scheme. I have already signed a cheque to Her Majesty's Government and I did it willingly, as an honest taxpayer. But the money could perhaps have been better used to support my family and my humble pleasures in the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for showing just how the Government are introducing their measures and illustrating the kind of impact that they may well have on the ordinary taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not it well understood by the Deputy Prime Minister that bringing forward the payment of bills represents a cost, because it means writing out a cheque? Was not that his point, about which small businesses were so angry, when he suggested that it was in people's interest to pay as late as possible? Obviously, that is beneficial for them, but it is extremely damaging for small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a strong point. The Deputy Prime Minister has made clear his views on the payment of debts and I suspect that his views may well have influenced the Financial Secretary. Some people want to delay paying their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
debts and some people want to ensure that they get their money quickly. The Financial Secretary and the Government want to get the money from the taxpayer as quickly as possible. Not only have they imposed on the taxpayer the biggest tax hike in British peacetime history but they are now seeking, in the Financial Secretary's own words, to bring
<br><blockquote><p>"forward the moment when the tax bill has to be paid."</p></blockquote>
His own words indict him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way on that point again; we have laboured it enough. Let me proceed with the next sentence of the Financial Secretary's letter. He states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Your leading article is plain wrong when it says that self assessment is a job creation scheme for accountants."</p></blockquote>
Self-assessment is a job-creation scheme for preparers of tax returns of whatever affiliation, whether qualified accountants, software producers, publishers or others. It is also a job-creation scheme for all taxpayers who go it alone—in unpaid jobs.<br><br>
Page 19 of the TaxAid report on the regulation of tax advisers in the United Kingdom in December 1995 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite the Revenue's claims that self assessment does not mean that more taxpayers will need professional advice, it must surely be inevitable that some individuals will turn to tax agents for the first time in their lives, to ask for help in completing their tax returns."</p></blockquote>
Even the Inland Revenue appears to agree. Notes to schedule 8 of the current version of the draft return contain numerous statements urging taxpayers to seek professional advice if they have any doubts. H. and R. Block, a firm that runs an extensive network of tax shops in the United States has said that it may set up in the United Kingdom. That is my answer to the hon. Gentleman. I shall move on to the Financial Secretary's next comment:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tax itself is complicated—we live in a complicated world."</p></blockquote>
How much more complicated is it getting under the Government? That is an extraordinary admission that the Government do not support the cause of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—the cause of simplification. It was edged out last year and the Financial Secretary has now condemned himself in speaking of a complicated world. Why should tax be complicated just because the world is complicated? There is no reason why it should. In many instances, tax legislation seems more complicated than the real world circumstances that is governs. Labour believes in genuine simplification as well as simplifying the language of legislation. That is why we supported that amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield last year.<br><br>
The next part of the Financial Secretary's letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"But, if businessmen do not want to have to calculate their own tax payments, under self assessment then they do not have to—the Revenue will do it for them."</p></blockquote>
But the business person or any other person required to file a return will have to assemble a return that may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
be three or four times longer than the present form. The next sentence states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the longer-term self assessment represents a simplification of the tax system, particularly for the self employed."</p></blockquote>
Self-assessment simplifies Inland Revenue's arrangements by transferring the burden to individuals—a form of privatisation. Self-assessment does not change the complexity of legislation: it is only a collection mechanism. The Government's argument does not stand up and they cannot possibly sustain such an argument. The Financial Secretary's letter goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"The new system will do away with endless streams of estimated assessments, appeals, postponements and revised assessments".</p></blockquote>
It will replace them with endless streams of longer returns, inquiries about tax returns and random audits. That will be the Bill's effect. The Financial Secretary continues by stating that the new system
<br><blockquote><p>"will save self employed businesses up to £250 million in terms of compliance costs."</p></blockquote>
The figure of £250 million is the upper limit of Inland Revenue's range of predicted savings of £125 million to £250 million on compliance cost assessment. That is two years out of date in any case as it applied back in November 1994. It is a highly speculative estimate which does not take into account the costs of new burdens. The TaxAid report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, despite the Revenue's state aim of reducing compliance costs through the introduction of self assessment it remains far from clear that this will be achieved."</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary's letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"By all means let us have a debate on self assessment. We are happy to deal with genuine concerns. The system has already been trialed with success on 5,000 real taxpayers in Leicester."</p></blockquote>
The first trial on 1,000 volunteers appears to have been a bit of a disaster. Only 56 per cent. of taxpayers got their self-assessment returns right first time. The figure for taxpayers' agents was only slightly better at 60 per cent. Moreover, those figures ignored small errors: some sources in the Inland Revenue said that the truer figures were closer to 20 per cent. The results are hardly surprising, given that the first consultation pack on the new returns contained instructions such as:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the figure in box 9 is £3,000 or less, copy the figure in box 10 to box 29. Do not fill in boxes 12 to 28. If the figure in box 9 is more than £3,000, enter into box 12 the figure in box 9, less the total of any dividend income in boxes 6.25, 8.15 and 9.2 but excluding the total of any dividends shown in box 2 above of all previous Working Sheets 2 completed."</p></blockquote>
It is not surprising that people got it wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is easier to read the Scott report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the second trial on 5,000 taxpayers has only just been completed, it is not clear what we shall find. However, it is clear that the way in which the process has been handled is a legitimate cause for concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has systematically attacked every argument in favour of self-assessment, yet he began by saying that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0441">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
favoured self-assessment in principle. Will he say why he favours it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I favour self-assessment because the process can bring great benefits to taxpayers if it is handled properly and introduced in a way that gives people confidence. It can give people the chance to exercise a degree of control over the way their taxes are assessed. It can also reduce Government costs, which is a good thing. All those benefits are likely to be lost if we proceed in the complex and half-baked way that typifies the Government's present approach.<br><br>
Gerry Hart, president of the Institute of taxation, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Arguably the major problem with self-assessment is the proposed tax return. The supporting schedules which cover specific sources of income are undoubtedly going to create problems."</p></blockquote>
We are looking at a series of clauses, principally clause 115, which introduce a raft of amendments to amendments. It is not surprising that the Government have got themselves in difficulty with the proposals. Labour Members are very worried about the process.<br><br>
Finally, I shall return to a point made by the Financial Secretary in a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East. He stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"One area of your concern which I understand you highlighted on Breakfast Television was the question of 'red tape'. Self assessment does away with much of this by largely replacing systems of estimated assessments, postponement applications, delayed hearings and revised assessments, all separately raised for trading income, rental income, capital gains, with a single statement of tax due."</p></blockquote>
Self-assessment does away with much of the Inland Revenue's red tape, including delayed hearings, but, unless we are careful about how it is implemented, it will replace that red tape with many new burdens on taxpayers and employers.<br><br>
The Minister goes on in his letter to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Given this, I would be grateful for your thoughts on how you would propose further to refine the new system to meet the concerns you have expressed."</p></blockquote>
Labour's new proposal is to postpone the implementation of self-assessment for one year. That would allow the Inland Revenue to finish training its staff, complete the installation of new technology and new management systems, complete its design and trial of the new return, prepare taxpayers and their advisers, give them more time to understand and prepare for the new system, and allow the Government to present a consolidated version of the new rules. It would also mean that people preparing for self-assessment next year would not have to work with what we had to work with to try to understand the work involved. That system is not good enough.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The biggest tax change in British history should be better planned, better introduced and better
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
administered. In the words of Philip Davis of Ernst and Young, quoted in <i>Accountancy Age</i> on 11 January 1996:
<br><blockquote><p>"the whole thing was being rushed through unnecessarily and too many problems remained … If you look at the Finance Bill, for instance, there are 18 pages of amendments in the 80 pages of self-assessment legislation which they didn't get right before. This is the last chance the Government has to get it right. It does not fill me with any confidence at all."</p></blockquote>
I agree, and I am concerned at the way in which the Government have proceeded today and in which they are rushing through a measure that will be a burden on business and bring forward the date when the tax bill is paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Warwickshire has completely underestimated the complexity of the present system. The combination of the present method of assessment with the prior-year rules creates an extremely complicated system. There are two aspects to that: the hon. Gentleman referred briefly to the first when he quoted one sentence from the letter of my hon. Friend the Minister to <i>The Independent.</i> At the moment, most self-employed people fail to send in their accounts on time because there is not a sufficiently disciplined system of ensuring that they do so. So they start by getting an estimated assessment of their profits from the Inland Revenue; they then have to appeal against that assessment and a final assessment has to be issued. As a result, huge quantities of paper can go back and forwards before the final result is achieved. Under the new system, people will be able to send in one return, with a cheque, and that will be the end of the matter. That will be a huge simplification and a great prize.<br><br>
That is being combined with another important change. I wanted to ask the hon. Gentleman—who refused to give way—whether he supported the change from the prior-year basis of assessment to the current-year basis. That is also a huge simplification because in future the profits assessed will be those of the current year so that the actual profits of the business will be actually taxed. That may sound strange, but at the moment if one adds up a business's profits over a period of, for example, 15 years and that sum comes to £150,000, tax can be levied on another figure of profit. The reason for that is the complexity of the opening and closing year rules. If one does not tax the current year's profits, artificial rules have to be invented to deal with the opening three years and the closing three years. If one starts a business and decides that one's accounting year will run from 9 April to 8 April of the next year—accountants advise that the accounting date be fixed just after the end of the tax year—one does not, under the present arrangements, pay tax on the profits in the accounting year of 1995–96 until the tax year of 1997–98. There is a huge delay—which is an advantage if one has a rising profits trend, but the special rules for the opening and closing years are extremely complicated and difficult to explain to small business men. The hon. Gentleman has underestimated the complexity of the present system, and the simplicity of self-assessment if we get it right.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman says that self-assessment is being rushed in, so we will not get it right. This

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
measure was first mooted in principle before the last general election, it was announced as Government policy in the 1993 Budget, the major proportion of the legislation was first introduced in 1994 and was amended last year, and it is being amended again this year. It was introduced over a six-year period, so if that is his idea of rushing it in, good for him.<br><br>
The Government adopted a measured approach because they were aware that this was a radical change to the tax system. It is certainly a substantial change, but to compare it with the Child Support Agency is ludicrous. The Child Support Agency did not exist before the relevant legislation was implemented on 1 April 1993: it was a completely new organisation with new staff. The Inland Revenue has been around quite a long time and has considerable experience of dealing with major changes in the tax system.<br><br>
At a meeting of the Public Accounts Select Committee two weeks ago, I asked the chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue whether he was satisfied with the progress that he was making on the introduction of self-assessment. It was not possible for a Select Committee of this House to invite the chief executive of the Child Support Agency one year before the Act was implemented to explain how she was getting on, because she had not been appointed. It is ludicrous to draw such a comparison.<br><br>
The Revenue has the experience to get this measure right. It recently introduced a major change in pay and file for corporation tax and that has gone pretty smoothly. That was a more significant change and it affected many more taxpayers. The Revenue has the experience, resources and skills to get this right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary confirm whether civil servants who were trying to get corporation tax pay and file right could be transferred to self-assessment to deal with the difficulties and to try to get that right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Comptroller and Auditor General reported to the Public Accounts Select Committee on pay and file, because it was possible to establish what progress was being made. Of course, it is vital to have adequate staff in the Inland Revenue who are trained to deal with the difficulties. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary should reassure us that no staff cuts will be made until the new system is up and running.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. No doubt the Financial Secretary will confirm that and will also confirm that none of the EDS, who were also working on corporation tax pay and file, has now been transferred to self-assessment because of concerns about the way in which the software programs have been operating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt my hon. Friend will reply to those questions in his own time in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The <i>Financial Times</i> on 9 January reported that the hon. Gentleman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
agreed that the timing of the introduction of self-assessment could not have been worse. What did he mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very simple: it is being introduced to coincide with a general election. As the hon. Member for North Warwickshire said, it is likely that the tax returns will land on the mats of taxpayers during a general election campaign. That is what I was referring to. As is happens, I think that if there are difficulties with the new system, they will arise some months later. If their is trouble, it is likely to start when the penalty regime begins to bite, which will probably be at the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1998. The Government of the day will have to cope with that.<br><br>
That was the only point I was making. But there is never a right time to make such a change. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire wants to postpone it for one year, because he believes that that will somehow result in a major improvement. I do not believe that. I do not believe that the companies in the hon. Gentleman's constituency that he has so assiduously consulted will necessarily make good use of that year, as many taxpayers will only get around to doing something about it when the system forces them to. Putting introduction off for a year will allow people to put off reading about it for another year. Taxpayers who wish to find out about it have had plenty of opportunity to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday in the House there was a welcome step forward for a bipartisan approach when an inquiry into the crisis in further education was announced. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the question of self-assessment should be considered jointly, instead of being a party process driven by the Whips?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that if the hon. Gentleman talked to the Inland Revenue people dealing with the matter he would discover that the process is almost certainly past the point of no return. Although the new system is supposed to be introduced in 1997, employers must start keeping the appropriate records from 6 April this year. That is a matter of weeks away and it would be quite wrong to pull the plug on the process now. That would cause chaos, and I do not accept that it is possible to reach agreement with the Opposition.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire advocates his proposals in a disingenuous manner, simply for party political reasons. The new system will have to be introduced in due course. We have reached the point where we must get on and introduce it. There has been wide consultation and the experiments that the hon. Gentleman described have been held, with thousands of taxpayers involved.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister wrote to every Member of Parliament in November to explain some of the advantages that had accrued as a result of the experiment involving 5,000 volunteers in the Leicester area. He said that the new return introduced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
after that trial was more streamlined and easier for people to handle. The number of main schedules has been reduced from 14 to seven by expanding the tax form to cover more of the standard cases. As a result, only one in five taxpayers will need to complete more than one schedule in addition to the form.<br><br>
I have been looking at the new form. Schedule 1 deals with employment. The number of pages that taxpayers will have to complete comes to not much more than the total required to be completed in a tax form at present. I do not have such a form here, but I think that there are about 16 pages to be filled in. There are more than 16 pages in the proposed new form, but many of those are guidance about how the form should be completed.<br><br>
As a result of the Leicester experiment, some fairly major changes and simplification have been introduced. In addition, as my hon. Friend said, there will be less work for those who leave it to the Revenue to calculate the tax due. Also, better design and signposting make it easier for people to find and follow the notes that are relevant to them.<br><br>
Some consultations about self-assessment were held last year with Members of Parliament, for whom there is a special schedule 1. I invited Inland Revenue officials to talk about the new form, and I am pleased that, as a result of those discussions, and no doubt as a result of representations by other hon. Members, our own schedule has been simplified.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire read out an horrendously complicated guidance note which told people to go from one box to another and to add up the product of two boxes and deduct it from a third. Such difficulties can be simplified if people take part in real-life experiments such as the Inland Revenue organised in Leicester.<br><br>
It is not true that employers have no role at the moment in helping employees with their tax returns. Employers are currently required to provide every employee with a P60 at the end of the tax year, which shows pay and tax deducted. They also have to provide something that is a good deal more complicated: almost all employees—because it is any employee who earns more than £8,500 a year—must be given a P11D. Employers are therefore used to having to provide their employees with information. They are being given plenty of notice of the changes that are going to be made. I have listened to the audio tape—which features John Cleese—that has been designed by the Revenue for employers.<br><br>
All those factors help employers. When it comes to the crunch, if companies say, "We didn't know anything about it", I would answer that the Inland Revenue has worked hard to make sure that they do.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was also concerned that there would be a huge growth in the number of tax advisers, as if the measure were a job creation programme for accountants. It does not need to be like that. It should be possible for most taxpayers to complete their tax return.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree that it does not need to be like that. It could be much simpler, which is what we want. We are not trying to be curmudgeonly or difficult about the process—we want it to succeed. We just think that the Government need a bit—or a lot—of help and advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have been getting a lot of help and advice because they have consulted widely. The hon. Gentleman seems to imply that they should take on board every single comment, criticism and representation. Many have been taken on board. If that were not the case, the Institute of Chartered Accountants would not have said in its paper, which I received last week:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are still a number of problems which are worrying our members."</p></blockquote>
That implies that some of the problems that it had in the first place have now been resolved. Of course some problems are still outstanding, but I believe that many of them can be addressed over the coming months.<br><br>
Taxpayers need to be careful about whom they go to for tax advice. Anyone can set up in the high street as a tax adviser, but taxpayers would be well advised to see a chartered accountant for tax advice, because they need to see someone who is qualified in tax affairs.<br><br>
The new system ought to be welcomed. I finally elicited from the hon. Gentleman two reasons why he thought that it would be a good thing. His first was that taxpayers would have more control over their tax affairs and his second was that there would be a saving to the Inland Revenue. I hope that, if we can get it right, the new system will mean considerable simplification. The Inland Revenue has worked hard to achieve that goal. There will be difficulties, but it should go ahead on the proposed date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was struck by a phrase that the Financial Secretary used some hours ago. He said that self-assessment puts the taxpayer in the driving seat. He is right and I entirely agree with him.<br><br>
The phrase has resonance for me because I have a teenage daughter who, from 1 April, will be paying tax for the first time. I had to explain to her why she should pay tax, which caused her some anxiety. What causes anxiety for me, however, is that not only is she about to pay tax, but she is about to drive a car. I had to give her some driving coaching over the weekend. Putting people in the driving seat is not easy—particularly when it is my daughter. Wrong turns occur—I experienced them.<br><br>
Self-assessment will lead to wrong turns. The Financial Secretary ought to listen to the people who accept that there will be wrong turns. In particular, he should listen to the Federation of Small Businesses, which says that it agrees with the scheme in principle, although it will be difficult and there will be wrong turns. It pleads for its members not to be fined in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
first year—either by a £100 fine or a 5 per cent. surcharge on unpaid tax—but to be cautioned. It wants the Government to accept that it will be difficult to put small businesses in the driving seat. When they take the inevitable wrong turns in the first year, they should be cautioned, not fined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend rightly quotes from the Federation of Small Businesses, which says much the same as us—this is a good idea, but it is being rushed in. Who speaks for business now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee wants to do what is best for business. Ministers have made concessions and are trying to hear the voice of business, but they must do more.<br><br>
It is important that everyone accepts the system. We cannot have a good driving test unless the public accept it, and the same is true of the self-assessment scheme. The debate has so far focused narrowly on those of us who are in the trade and on the accountancy profession, and has not addressed a wider audience. Public debate must be widespread if we are to have a good driving test and self-assessment system. The debate is just starting, but it has not yet caught people's imagination. The new system must have public support, and that cautions delay.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield mentioned signposting. If one takes a driving test, one needs roads and signs, but I am not confident that those are in place in the case of self-assessment. That is being worked on, but I am concerned about the computer systems—the major roadway down which the system will be driven forward. The CESA system is not in place and is still being worked on. Cuts have been made in the programme, and it has been suggested that those responsible are hurrying and skimping on the technology.<br><br>
The roadway needs to be in place, and so do the engineers. Morale appears, however, to be lacking in the Inland Revenue. My hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire has referred to the concerns and difficulties of trade union members in the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
As with all driving tests, we need driving instructors—the people who are interested in self-assessment, such as the accountants and tax advisers. The measures open a new avenue of trade for them, and we may have to consider regulation in the future.<br><br>
The taxpayer must be put in the driving seat. My experience with my daughter has shown me that this will be a long and painful business. We have to keep our cool, not get anxious and set a timetable. The present timetable is far too hurried—I want people to pass the test on their first attempt, and that counsels a little more caution. Strong voices are telling the Financial Secretary to delay the measures for a year and ensure that we pass the test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perhaps one of the few members of the Committee who has lived under a self-assessment regime. It did not worry me in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
slightest as it was conceived in the country in which I worked. I had to fill in just four pages for the local revenue with details of my income, property, wealth and so forth. Such was the scheme in what is considered to be a low tax regime by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development—Switzerland.<br><br>
I am concerned that as it is being rushed through—I emphasise the word "rushed"—the self-assessment-scheme will have the most enormous impact on the lives of many British citizens. On the basis of the forms that have kindly been sent to us, there are about 151 questions in the main tax form as currently constituted. My hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire made the most merciless fun of how the questions are constructed—like an immense loop of spaghetti which the taxpayer must then untangle all by himself. There are also some seven schedules—I take the word from the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—each of which contains many questions.<br><br>
The new system will represent the biggest intrusion into the private lives and affairs of individuals that we have ever witnessed in British history—that is currently the case for the self-employed, and it is to be applied to ordinary taxpayers. It is well that the Committee take note of that fact.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield neatly answered the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) about the quote in the Financial Times that the timing of self-assessment is unfortunate because it might coincide with the electoral life cycle. That is as may be, but I would not want my party to gain any electoral advantage from the grotesque intrusion into British people's affairs that will land on their doormats next spring. However, I warn my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench to beware, because this is a time bomb that they will have, somehow, to defuse. I doubt whether, in two years time, the pleas in favour of self-assessment made so strongly by Conservative Members will be well remembered if, as I suspect, it is the fortune of my hon. Friends to be on the Treasury Front Bench defending the application of the system.<br><br>
The 151 questions plus the seven schedules amount to a bureaucratisation of the individual's relationship with the state such as we have not witnessed since the collapse of the Soviet system. I remain astonished that it is the Conservative party of all parties which is introducing the self-assessment scheme under the present system instead of taking the opportunity to simplify and restructure the tax system, as suggested by every professional body and everyone who thinks seriously about tax. I am not advocating simplification in the direction of a flat tax so that the tax form covers one side of a postcard, but there should be a wholesale simplification and restructuring. That would allow self-assessment to be not an unwarranted and meddlesome intrusion into people's private affairs, but a means to reconnect the citizen to society as expressed by the state.<br><br>
We should consider a unified tax system. I have read much of the literature on that. One of the common narrative themes in any discussion of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0445">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
taxation is the tension between the gentlemen of the Inland Revenue and those of Customs and Excise. The Inland Revenue is presented as a type of All Souls discussion theme park—perhaps that is why the Chief Secretary, as a former member of All Souls, will remain in his post for a few more days—whereas the people in Customs and Excise are depicted as brutal tax gatherers, hammering at the doors of the small trader, anxious to get their hands on adequate VAT returns.<br><br>
Since Customs and Excise took over the duty of dealing with indirect taxation—principally VAT, which has grown in strength as a source of tax revenue in this country—it has been claimed that the Inland Revenue has looked with fond longing—perhaps jealously—on the extensive powers of the duty men and said yes to having us own swat teams or a sledgehammer to smash through the doors into the private financial arrangements of citizens. It has so devised self-assessment in order to adopt the rude and crude manners of Customs and Excise.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
It has been put in vulgar literature that Inland Revenue is seeking to be the new Gestapo—the phrase that Churchill used in his famous broadcast of 1945. Part of the drive of the past 16 years of the Government has been away from the productive, manufacturing economy to the rentier economy of unearned income and rent. We are all implicated. We can see it in the schedules rather than the principal form that we shall all soon have to fill under self-assessment.<br><br>
Almost any financial relationship that we enter into—involving savings, pensions, a home that we own, a cottage in the country, or homes overseas in France or Spain—embraces a complex mixture of revenue and outgoings. Private insurance is necessary for many people. Even tax-free instruments such as PEPs, Tessas, national savings or premium bonds have to be registered in the appropriate schedule.<br><br>
When self-assessment is taken forward, it will represent direct interference in the private financial arrangements of this country's citizens. It is not being introduced in tandem with a merger of the Revenue and Customs and Excise to produce a unified tax-raising system which is common in other countries where self-assessment applies, nor is it being introduced in line with the advice that has been offered. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made a plea for us all to turn to professionally qualified advisers—chartered and certified accountants. I certainly have to rely on one to fill in my modest tax returns. For most of my constituents, however, as individuals or as members of small companies, independent financial advisers—many of whom are non-diploma advisers—will help with the task of self-assessment. Many of them work well and the vast bulk of them may be honest, but what is not clear from reading the background notes is the extent to which Inland Revenue will be able to lay its hands on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
working papers of all the independent financial advisers operating up and down the country. That should include computer records and files held in offices about clients, but will all that information be made available to Inland Revenue?<br><br>
When the National Audit Office reported in 1994 on the hows and whys of Inland Revenue launching an investigation, it found that in 60 per cent. of cases, the reason for launching such an investigation into the tax affairs of an individual was the subjective assessment by an official. In addition to receiving the forms, the Inland Revenue will undertake 10,000 random checks as an external control on the self-assessment procedure. I put it to the Minister that independent financial advisers will be worried that their records, tax discs and computerised material will be made available to the state.<br><br>
The fundamental problem is the nature of our state system. Self-assessment works well when the state is more decentralised, the source of tax raising is not one machine in Whitehall, and when the relationship is with subsidiary state power, whether at local, regional or, as in America, state level. This country is an immensely centralised, secretive state. As we have seen in the past few days, accountability is a national and international scandal.<br><br>
Does the Minister accept at least some of the amendments tabled in the name of my hon. Friends? Indeed, if the Liberal Democrats or other Opposition parties have tabled amendments, I hope that he will consider them. Last year the Public Accounts Select Committee held hearings on self-assessment and produced an interim report. The Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service has not examined this matter.<br><br>
I repeat a point that I made earlier: for this issue we should drop the absurd, adversarial, bipartisan approach of whipped majorities. A good example was set yesterday on the future of education. An earlier example was the approach taken to Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Taxpayers who face self-assessment will thank us if we put this measure off for another year and if we approach it in a bipartisan manner. The Government face mounting criticism. That criticism covers the business pages, but it will soon enter the consciousness of the ordinary citizen as it leaves the business pages and hits the news pages, the William Rees-Mogg column and the columns of Mr. Bushell in <i>The Sun.</i> As people realise what is about to hit them, they will not thank the poll tax and Child Support Agency Government for forcing through this change on a whipped majority when the country is saying, "Hold on, think again, get it right."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a couple of practical points on clause 115. The Government should have learned the lessons of the Child Support Agency legislation. Parliament recognised that something should be done to ensure that parents pay for their children, but people have been caused distress because the legislation was rushed and the administration was established too quickly.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0446">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
Although parts of the self-assessment clauses, such as those dealing with penalties, are simple, the process will be anything but simple. I agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the real problems will occur when penalties are imposed because people have missed deadlines, lost records or got things wrong. Those of us who are still Members of Parliament at that time will have postbags full of letters expressing worries, complaints and distress: from small businesses faced with bankruptcy and going into recession, for example, partly because of penalties that may have been forced on them because the legislation had been pushed through too rapidly.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to respond to two specific points. First, on computerised software packages, which I am sure will be marketed enthusiastically—there will probably be several, all addressing the problem differently—on the basis that a software package will simplify matters for taxpayers and small businesses completing tax returns on a self-assessment basis. The younger generation, who think that they are whiz kids on computers, will think that that is great and will say, "Oh yes, we'll set up a new business, buy a software package, tax—no problem", and put all their records on the computerised software package. The clause, which deals with loss of records, may create immense problems if newly formed, whiz kid-type small businesses deal with self-assessment tax details in that way and, because they make one mistake on such a package, lose the majority of their records. They may put everything on computer—the filing system carefully detailing all chits, dividend slips and so on—and it will be a nightmare when mistakes are made and things go wrong. When the Minister responded to the amendment, he mentioned electronic packages
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
that could keep dividend records, but not packages that are used for everything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of accuracy, I must point out that I was responding to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding about CREST.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did hear that. The Minister will appreciate that I am referring to something different but equally important, which is why I am raising it now.<br><br>
The second issue is that of the problems that will occur when a couple, in particular, have been involved in running a small business and the relationship breaks down. One part of that partnership, who may have looked after the tax requirements, may disappear and take all the records with him or her. Will the Minister comment on that? How will self-assessment make that simpler?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not have time before the end of the sitting to open the batting for our side on that wicket, but we dealt with the last point raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) last week when we debated partnerships and changes in responsibility. The Opposition have obviously just woken up to that point or I would not have been asked the question.</span></p>
