	<div class='page-header'><h1>Family Law Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from Col. 268]</p>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying earlier that it has been suggested in debate that clause 26 may lead to a two-tier system, with the legally aided party being forced into mediation while the better-off spouse would have full access to legal representation. I do not believe that that will prove to be the case. The Government believe that in many cases, legally aided or otherwise, mediation may have a role to play as a more appropriate way of resolving particular types of family dispute than arm's-length negotiations between lawyers or through court procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes that belief clear in several ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private individuals are of course free to spend their money as they see fit, and the Government do not want to prevent them from doing so, but the benefits of mediation are such that I believe that suitable couples will use mediation in appropriate cases, even when they are paying privately. Mediation is not therefore a cheap and cheerful alternative to legal advice. Research undertaken by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation certainly shows that there have been many good outcomes of mediation, and those are not limited to cases that depend on some form of legal assistance. Legal advice will be available in support of mediation for those who need it, and will be state funded for those who are eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When couples mediate, they negotiate with the benefit of a neutral mediator—in other words, they represent themselves in the negotiations. I think that I have made it clear how inappropriate it would be lawyers to be drawn into that process. People should not need a lawyer to represent them in the negotiations, but they may need legal advice and assistance in support of mediation. That will be available when needed. That is an important distinction when, for example, a couple wishes to negotiate matters such as residence and contract arrangements through mediation but to be separately represented in arm's-length negotiations in respect of matters such as property, which may be inappropriate for mediation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to eligibility, there is nothing in the provisions to prevent mediation services being given in relation to matters concerning the child, with legal advice and support where needed, and legal aid being given for representation in relation to property matters. Those distinctions are frequently drawn in mediation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
When public funds are at stake the Government clearly have a legitimate interest in attempting to secure the best service at the greatest value for money, without—I emphasise without—jeopardising a client's right to fair resolution of the dispute. That is the philosophy behind the rebuttable presumption created by clause 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should further make it clear that legal advice and assistance will be available not only in support of mediation but at its conclusion, to ensure that clients are able to seek independent legal advice on the terms of any agreement that is reached through mediation before signing it. That affords clients protection against agreeing to settlements that may not be in the their best interests, although I hope that once mediation has become established as a method of solving disputes and any public misunderstanding of mediation has been dispelled, it will become clear that lawyers rarely see the need to unpick an understanding that has been reached between the parties. That should not be interpreted as any sort of injunction against there being legal advice at that stage of the process. Legal advice and assistance will be available to couples who need assistance with the divorce process and advice about their legal responsibilities, as is the case now under the green form scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay about the actual costs of legal aid in the current structure of divorce settlements. In 1991–92, the total sum of money expended on legal aid in matrimonial matters—civil matrimonial legal aid for representation—was a little more than £150 million. At that time, green form assistance and advice given in support of the divorce process accounted for about £42 million. In the past four years the cost for green form advice and assistance has risen to some £46 million, from £42 million, but for representation in civil matrimonial legal aid cases it has risen from £150 million to £296 million. A considerable investment in legal aid is being expended through the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say how much was reclaimed by charge from the Legal Aid Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but I shall be happy to produce the figure for the hon. Gentleman. The purpose of my highlighting the figures is not to suggest that we need to drive down legal advice. The Legal Aid Board often supports litigation which, if parties were able to proceed through mediation, would not need to be taken to court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much does the Minister think will be saved by his proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No member of the Committee can answer that—unless the hon. Gentleman can say how many people would choose mediation rather than merely be represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say how much his proposals will cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we give people the facility to resolve disputes through mediation—a core aspect of the Bill is that it does not require each party to proceed through mediation but allows parties to resolve disputes by that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
route if they wish—there will be a substantial saving in public expenditure. I expected the hon. Gentleman to support that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So as to calculate how substantial the savings will be, can the Minister say what the cost of setting up this infrastructure will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly supposes that responsibility for setting up the mediation infrastructure will result in a capital cost that will falls in one lump sum to the Government. I made it clear that mediation will be funded through the Legal Aid Board. When parties elect to proceed through mediation, the cost will be met by the board. The figures that I have show that, for example, where parties elect to resolve issues relating to children-only mediation, the current cost is about £250 per couple. In all-issues mediation, the current average cost is between £700 and £800 per couple. Average cost per party in proceedings litigated through the courts is £1,500. The Committee will no doubt have gathered that in cases that can proceed via mediation—if parties voluntarily take that path—it will be a less expensive option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What proportion of persons does the Minister think will seek that route, or is this another unavailable figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can pluck a figure from the air, as can the hon. Gentleman. He has spent so much time talking to the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, who insists that each proposal must be costed to the nth degree and that he must be satisfied with it, that presumably he is now being told by him that he must anticipate human behaviour to such an extent that the option the Bill offers cannot be realised unless we define precisely how many people will take advantage of it. No one in the Committee can do that. If that is the basis of the hon. Gentleman's argument and if he ever aspires to be able to make decisions from a governmental position, the Lord Chancellor's Department will certainly not be spending much on such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that the Minister has got the message. He is absolutely right; there will be very tight control of what the Lord Chancellor's Department spends. The sooner that is understood by all concerned, the better. The hon. Gentleman said that the Legal Aid Board will set aside certain sums for the purposes of start-up costs. How much is it anticipated will need to be set aside?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have told the hon. Gentleman the basis on which the funding will be provided. It depends on the take-up of mediation. Following the voluntary principle of my hon. Friends the Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle and for Broxtowe, and given that no couple in the country elects to proceed on the basis of mediation, what is the hon. Gentleman's argument? That route will, in due course, be bound to lead to a saving in public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is at great pains, for which I thank him, to make it clear to the Committee that mediation is entirely voluntary. No one will be forced
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
into it. What worries me is the strong presumption that legal aid will be given for mediation, but not for the hiring of a lawyer to represent a person's interests in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My response to that is the point that I made before the suspension: it is not uncommon for parties to refuse mediation when their first contact is with their lawyers who may say to them that, in some way or other, mediation is not a process that should be undertaken. That is especially so when clients have confidence in their lawyers. For the purposes of assessing suitability for mediation at least, it is necessary that the first meeting take place with the mediator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is with a heavy heart that I make the following remark because I may appear to be supporting the hon. Member for Brent, South—and that does not please me at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any commercial activity, one would first work out the possible market for the service or product, after which the capital costs would be worked out—followed by what the likely turnover would be, the cost of that turnover and the profit margin. One of the failings of legislation is that we never work out a proper business plan for services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, I want to go along with my hon. Friend's wishes, but I urge him to give some reassurance to those of us who have grave doubts about the matter. It is important; we do not know whether it will be a little thing or a great big thing. We do not know how many staff will be involved or the relevant costs. At what point will the legal agencies that will be charged with implementing the policy return to the Government and ask for more money? We must have some idea about such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government will not run the mediation service. At present, a range of organisations of different disciplines provide such services. They will be made available and contracted through the Legal Aid Board. My hon. Friend said that plans are drawn up for businesses. Yes, but in essence, National Family Mediation is a business and the people offering those particular services will have drawn up a business plan to assess the basis upon which they should offer services to the Legal Aid Board. It is already clear that others are also seeking to compete in offering those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard earlier in the debate that the legal profession, through the Law Society, is arguing that the amendment should be accepted. It is taking a long-leg position, because many lawyers are actively considering gaining skills in mediation so that they, too, can offer those services to the Legal Aid Board. That is how the structure will develop. It will be controlled by contracts through the Legal Aid Board. The contracting parties will have to abide by a code of practice set up by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor. That is the essence of the mechanism for delivering the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises an important question. It seems to me that the voluntary organisations that presently provide mediation bring to that task certain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
characteristics that I greatly admire and wish to see continued. If, as a major competitor, the legal profession decides to set up in-house services, will that drive the price up to the sort of costs per hour that the legal profession currently enjoys, or can we hope that the extraordinarily frugal and economic methods of the voluntary organisations will become the model? I have my doubts; I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that all the helpful questions are coming from my own side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What else would the hon. Gentleman expect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot contain himself even for a moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent correctly said that several organisations presently operate on a voluntary basis. One advantage of the new scheme is the capacity to direct state funds to those organisations for the services that they deliver in specific cases. Representations have been made to me, even during this Committee stage, that more grant aid should be made available to those organisations, but that is outside the remit. However, my hon. Friend's question is covered by the fact that the Legal Aid Board is under a duty to secure those services on a value-for-money basis. The board will have the responsibility for negotiating contracts with those who are offering to deliver mediation services. In those circumstances, it is quite clear that value-for-money criteria will be significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to my hon. Friend the Minister. Is he saying that if both lawyers and the mediation services receive legal aid from the beginning, solicitors may persuade their clients that they do not need mediation, but that they should do something that we are trying to deter them from doing—taking legal advice and arguments at the start?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only point that my hon. Friend has made with which I take issue is the matter of seeking to deter people from proceeding on the basis of legal aid by representation. I am arguing for a process in which people will certainly see a solicitor in the initial stages; I also believe that it is important that the parties should have the opportunity of having that first meeting with the mediator and for suitability to be assessed at that meeting. If one of the parties then says. "The process of mediation is not for me", I should then return to the voluntary nature of the rules set out by the committees. Indeed, the point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe that that is how the organisations themselves deal with such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly endorse many of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock), is particular that if the first meeting was with the legal representative—the solicitor—people who ultimately found that mediation had a role to play for them and who wished voluntarily to participate in it, might be somehow directed away from it. That is one of the points that I have tried to deal with during my response to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
I have listened carefully to the concerns that my colleagues have expressed and I will seriously consider them. I shall outline the sort of amendment that might deal with the core of what they said, as I am reluctant to accept the amendments. I would seriously consider an amendment to clause 26 that stated that the Legal Aid Board may not refuse funding for legal representation under section 15 of the Legal Aid Act 1988 solely on the basis that mediation is available, provided that the party has met a mediator and has been assessed as unsuitable for mediation or that his or her case is inappropriate for mediation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would hope to make it clearer that the principle of the voluntary nature of mediation should be applied by a mediator undertaking suitability assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall seriously consider tabling an amendment to clause 26 on Report to give effect to those provisions after appropriate consultation. I hope that that deals with the concerns to which my hon. Friends have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's comments. I should like him to confirm that the practice, which enshrines voluntarism, that the National Family Mediation already applies will be part of the Lord Chancellor's code of practice for awarding contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that we would hope to make it clearer that mediators undertaking suitability assessment should apply the principle of voluntarism to mediation. I have said that one large organisation uses that principle. The mechanism for dealing with such matters under a code of practice can be found in the Bill. I hope that that addresses the point that my hon. Friend made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that organisation applies that principle. I am anxious to ensure that anyone else who offers such a service has that principle enshrined in his contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I am making. We know that the organisations to which we referred are dealt with in that way. I am giving my hon. Friend an undertaking that I will consider that matter in the context of dealing with it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the dinner break, I consulted the Solicitors Family Law Association—which is not a trade union for these purposes; it is in favour of the Bill and genuinely interest in improving it—about the idea of people being effectively compelled under legal aid to attend one mediation meeting. The association was not attracted to that idea for the good reason that there is a limited number of mediators. Nationwide, there are 212 mediators who are expert in financial mediation. Many more mediators could deal with childrens' matters and other such matters, but only a limited number could deal with complicated financial disputes in divorce. The association remains unconvinced by the argument that it would be helpful to force people into even only one meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to hear that the Solicitors Family Law Association is not persuaded by that argu-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
ment. With respect, I am not surprised that the legal profession remains concerned about the operation of mediation in such a context. Many people within that association are actively considering whether to retrain so that they can offer a mediation service. I would argue that the decision people will take about whether to use mediation or the legal process and argument before the court will not necessitate an initial meeting with a mediator along the lines that I have outlined. I would argue that that strikes against what we are seeking to achieve in offering an informed choice. That is one reason why my hon. Friend should not support the case that has been advanced to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to tease this point out. The Minister is painting a scenario in which people proceeding with a divorce will visit a solicitor as their first meeting, but I thought that the whole point of the Bill was that there would be an initial information meeting, to be held by a qualified independent person, who would give people full information on how to proceed with the divorce. There would then be a cooling-off period, in which people could see a marriage counsellor. They would then file their statement of marital breakdown, bearing in mind what they had learnt in the information meeting. Presumably, at that meeting it would have been made clear that if people wanted to proceed with the divorce after filing the statement, they would have available the mediation route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that I understand the point. At present, people think, "I want to get divorced, so I should go and see my solicitor." Now, they will have to ask, "I want to get divorced. How do I do it?" They will then be told that they have to go to an information meeting, at which they will be told—fairly, by an independent qualified person, who has no stake in the matter either way—the various routes by which they can get their divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The slight problem with my hon. Friend's point is that he has successfully argued that a three-month gap should be introduced between the information meeting and the filing of a statement of marital breakdown. If he were arguing that there should be an information meeting, and thereafter someone would file the statement, there would be some force to his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am arguing that, because of the introduction of that three-month gap, the next step is the filing of the statement of marital breakdown, which will evidently take place as a result of consultation with the solicitor. It is at that point that one must consider whether the disputes will be resolved by way of negotiation between the lawyers and potential litigation, or whether proceedings could at least start on the basis of a suitability-for-mediation meeting. I have argued in favour of the latter course. My hon. Friend's success in convincing the House that there should be a three-month gap militates in favour of the proposition that I am putting forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 9, line 29, leave out "amicably" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"without resort to the court".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. It seeks to explore why the Lord Chancellor's Department has chosen to use the word "amicably", which carries the suggestion that somehow any proceedings that were other than by the clearly preferred route under clause 13 were bound to be less than amicable. Surely it is good practice in the legal profession—a practice to be encouraged, not least by the Lord Chancellor's Department—that even when lawyers are utilised, the relationship between the parties should remain amicable. There is nothing inherently lacking in amity in the relationship between lawyers when determining just and equitable settlements for their clients. The amendment is designed to tease out why the word "amicably" has been used, and suggests an alternative and perhaps better phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was initially tabled in another place by Boraness Hamwee, and although it was not moved, the noble Lady spoke to it and implied that it was a matter of drafting. She felt that it was slightly over-optimistic to expect disputes to be resolved amicably. That is the context of the alternative wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brent, South asked why we used the word "amicably" rather than the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"without resort to the court."</p></blockquote>
It is a question of drafting. When the initial proceedings are adjourned, I believe that there may still he circumstances when a party may seek recourse to the court for the purpose of perhaps, obtaining a consent order. To say that someone is making that application amicably is not the same as saying that it is without resort to the courts. In other words, a consent order would require recourse to the courts. Similarly—referring to the directions that are made by the court—reporting back is a matter that will be done in accordance with the adverb in the Bill. But that would not satisfy the terminology of the amendment, which refers to resorting to the court itself. I believe that the terminology of the Bill is satisfactory and that the amendment would prove too prescriptive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 96.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are necessary to give effect to the policy behind clause 18, which is currently not accurately reflected in the Bill. It has always been intended that even if one application for a divorce or separation order—by reference to a particular statement—has been made and withdrawn, it should be possible for further applications to be made, provided that the time limit, which is set out in clause 5(3)(b), has not expired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 95 clarifies that marital proceedings are to be treated as divorce and separation proceedings unless there is an application pending for a particular order. In that case, proceedings will be treated either as divorce or separation proceedings, depending on the order that is applied for. When a party has applied for either a divorce or a separation order and the application has been withdrawn, the proceedings will be of both types until a further application is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18(6)(e) currently gives the impression that proceedings come to an end even if an application is being tackled when the lapsed period—the time limit, which is set out in clause 5(3)(b)—is over. That is not our intention. Amendment No. 96 makes it clear that proceedings come to an end when the period of time is over only when there are no outstanding applications, or after outstanding applications have been withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to raise some points that I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to tackle in detail now because I have not given him notice of them. I may wish to table a new clause or amendments to a schedule to ascertain whether, on Report, my hon. Friend could consider bolstering children's relationships with both parents. I am indebted to Andrew Broadbent, who presented suggestions to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be sensible to add an item to the check list in Clause 1(3) of the Children Act 1989, namely
	<br><blockquote><p>"the maintenance of the child's relationship with each of his parents."</p></blockquote>
That is not explicitly stated at the moment and if it were it would make both courts and parents take it much more seriously. It is also important to try to relieve the pressure on children who may "have to choose" between one parent and another in the checklist. Instead of just talking about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the wishes and feelings of the child in question"</p></blockquote>
we should think of adding a prior qualification to the existing qualification:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the light of his age and understanding".</p></blockquote>
On the point about the definition of parental responsibility and making reference to the child's care and upbringing and not just to his property, it would be possible to add words such as "his care and upbringing" so that section 3(1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all rights, duties, powers, responsibility and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child, his care and upbringing and his property."</p></blockquote>
It would be worth seeing whether an amendment to section 11(7) might add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"may ask a welfare officer (ie as designated in section 7(1) of the Act) to report on any matters concerned with carrying the order into effect."</p></blockquote>
There are two other suggestions that I would like to put to my hon. Friend. Again, I do not expect a detailed response. It would be both inappropriate and impossible to do so this evening. To enable both parents to carry out their parental responsibility, to section 12 of the Children Act could be added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where a court makes a residence order in favour of one parent of the child, it shall make a contract order in favour of the other parent, unless it considers that not doing so would be better for the child."</p></blockquote>
Finally, it has been argued that the original intention of the Children Act was that a residence order for a child could cover both parents plus, if necessary, details on how much time the child was with each parent, which would not necessarily mean equal time with each. Section 12 could have an addition such as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a court may consider making a residence order in favour of both parents".</p></blockquote>
Those points are obviously too detailed to be considered this evening, I hope that either on Thursday or, perhaps more appropriately, on Report, my hon. Friend may be able to give a reasoned response and say whether these are proposals which his Department and the Department of Health might consider suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for intervening in that way. I have also heard from Dr. Broadbent. Therer are two elements in this which are terribly important. First, for all sorts of reasons which I fully understand and appreciate, welfare officers and social workers are sometimes far too ready to believe that the continuation of a relationship, usually with the father, is too disruptive. They arrive at that decision quite early. That combines with the father's difficulties, often physical difficulties, in providing the sort of arena in which to offer the care he thinks his child needs and discourages him from seeing his child. That is why 800,000 children in this country have no contract with their natural fathers. What my hon. Friend has said about welfare officers needs to be read in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a direct consequence of that observation, although I do not think it needs to be written into the Bill precisely, I urge the voluntary organisations, churches and all social services departments to give much more creative thought to the sort of foyer or whatever—I do not know how it would be described—where the father can have a natural relationship with his children when he has access to them. One of the more dispiriting features for many parents it is usually the father and is always the parent without caring responsibility is that they live a day tripper life. That is unwholly unsuitable.
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
It leads to an alteration of excessive gifts, expensive outings and meals in cafés when what the child needs more than anything else is time to be with the parent. The absence of accommodation in which that can be achieved is one of the glaring holes in the way in which services currently are run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I remind the Committee that earlier in our deliberations, I said that if hon. Members wished to put specific points to me, whether in our debates or along the lines put forward by my hon. Friend, I would be prepared to examine them to see how they may interface with specific provisions in the Bill. I hope that I will have the opportunity of seeing the submission to which my hon. Friend referred, to see whether it can be drawn within the scope of the Bill and exactly what is the purport and intention behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I point out that the intention of defining connected proceedings in clause 22 is to facilitate the giving of directions in respect of mediation under clause 12. In circumstances in which there are connected proceedings, if one is proceeding on the basis of mediation, it may be desirable that the connected proceedings should be held up to some extent while mediation is undertaken. That is the purport of the clause. The proposals put forward by my hon. Friends the Members for Eltham and for Mid-Kent might be discussed in relation to other parts of the Bill, or I might be able to direct their attention to ways in which they can raise the matters on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are about legal aid funding for reconciliation. The aims behind the amendments are simply to promote the possibility of reconciliation right up to the time of the divorce and to ensure that reconciliation is funded out of legal aid. Perhaps I should define "reconciliation". I do not mean some form of mediation; I mean marriage guidance which could possibly lead to reconciliation of the parties, thereby avoiding a divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to move amendment No. 47. That would have encouraged only reconciliation during the first six months after one or both of the spouses had made a statement of marriage breakdown. I shall not move that amendment in the light of the Committee's acceptance of the clause 8 package of amendments which includes the statutory three-month cooling off period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would provide for reconciliation on the same basis as mediation. They work on the basis of inserting the words "reconciliation or" wherever the word "mediation" occurs in the part of the Bill devoted to legal aid. They provide that if a person's financial circumstances qualify them for legal aid for mediation, they will automatically qualify for legal aid for reconciliation or marriage guidance. The amendments make it clear that reconciliation is voluntary. Both parties and a counsellor must consent before legal aid funding can be used. That meets the point made by the Minister in previous debates that marriage counselling must be voluntary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would the Government work with the Bill? The Government have accepted that if people were on full legal aid, they would qualify for an initial marriage counselling session before the statement. The amendments simply deal with the situation after the statement of marital breakdown is filed and, therefore, legal aid funding would be available for marriage guidance and reconciliation during the whole 18-month period for those who qualify for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said many times in our proceedings that 20,000 to 30,000 divorce petitions are withdrawn every
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
year. Given that there will be a period for reflection, presumably some people will change their minds. Indeed, it is realistic to expect that a considerable number of people will. Reconciliation, like any opportunity to save a marriage, should be encouraged by the Bill. The amendments would guarantee funding for reconciliation as a right for everyone who is already legal aided for mediation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Funding is needed to ensure the provision of reconciliation services. Without it, some people may have a mental barrier to seeking marriage counselling. The amendments deal specifically with the people affected by the Bill through the 18-month waiting period. I appreciate that there is general funding for marriage support services, but we all know that it is limited to about £3 million. That compares with, I think, more than £200 million devoted to legal aid for conciliation support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure is £250 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend corrects me. It is important to put reconciliation at the centre of the Bill and the amendments would achieve that. We already have it before the statement is filed. Many people would not, of course, want to take advantage of it and that is their right; no one is forcing them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My legal advisers tell me that if the amendments were passed, people would still be able to turn back from the divorce process and have reconciliation funded by legal aid. This would not cost a huge amount of money and might save some marriages. The cost of divorce is extremely high and the change would send a good message. Many people are worried about the Bill, but their fears would be allayed if the amendments were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this late hour I do not want to detain the Committee long. My hon. Friend's amendment is very sensible. What he offers can take place only if both parties to the divorce wish it. If that is so, there must be a real prospect of saving the marriage. The Treasury is here as a dark presence in the background and I am trying to think through its arguments. However, no one will enter divorce proceedings in order to get access to free marriage counselling; not even the Treasury could advance that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a real prospect of saving what admittedly will be a small number of marriages. Marriage guidance organisations say that the most effective time for marriage counselling is long before the divorce period starts. However, we have the prospect of saving some marriages and any couple who embark on the course suggested must have a real prospect of saving their marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend has pointed out the enormous saving that the amendments would produce, which would pay for the measure many times over, covering not only legal costs but the costs of marital breakdown. There is also a wider public interest, even if we save only a few broken homes for some children and the break-up of some marriages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is excellent. No doubt we shall be told that there are 57 legal aspects of it that need tight-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
ening up, but I know that my hon. Friend the Minister, with all his legal skills and with the high-powered legal team behind him, is quite capable of straightening them all out. The principle behind the amendment is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention of both my hon. Friends to give specific importance to marriage guidance services throughout the entire divorce process is commendable; indeed, I share it. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has already persuaded the Committee to agree that at the information meeting a person will be channelled towards marriage guidance and encouraged if he or she seeks to take advantage of it. In addition, financial support will be available for those who are unable to meet the cost. That provision has already been included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first saw this group of amendments, I thought that my hon. Friend's intention was, similarly, to raise the profile of reconciliation in the Bill. However, I was somewhat intrigued at the references in the amendments to people being "granted reconciliation". My first response was that the amendments simply cannot work. Their intention may be to extend the scope of the Legal Aid Act 1988 so that legal aid would be available for counsellors, for instance, who seek to assist couples effecting reconciliation. That is what, at first sight, might have been intended by the use of "reconciliation". However, previous amendments highlighting marriage support services, have used the terms "marriage support services" and "marriage guidance".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with these amendments is that reconciliation is not a justiciable issue. An attempt to save a marriage is a personal, not a legal, matter. Counselling is about the relationship between a couple or about the ability of individuals to come to terms with, and deal with, their problems. Consequently, there may not be a dispute as such, as is suggested by amendment No. 48, but a problem in the relationship. That could be caused by a variety of factors that are involved in marital breakdown. Poor communication, sexual problems, external factors and even bereavement can all affect the marital relationship. Placing counselling on a level with legal assistance or representation is not, in my view, a viable concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 also suggests that couples may be "granted reconciliation". My concern about the intention behind the amendments was taken into another sphere following a meeting with the Cheltenham Group last week. I do not know whether other members of the Committee have had the opportunity of meeting representatives of the Cheltenham Group. They have strong views about the Bill, but, although their views are honestly held, I do not share them. They presented me with a briefing paper in which they indicate their concerns and specifically outlined the ways in which they believe that the Bill should be taken forward. For example, they suggest a return to a fully fault-based system regarding grounds for divorce and settlements. They want custody awarded to fathers as a default. At our meeting, they said that in all circumstances custody should be granted to fathers and that there should be enforced shared custody after divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that submission from the Cheltenham Group, I then received another paper, which I under-
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
stand other members of the Committee may also have received. Briefing 4 on the Family Law Bill April 1996 says in item 1:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first fatal flaw in RELATE's position is its adoption of mediation rather than reconciliation."</p></blockquote>
It says that reconciliation and mediation are not the same, and continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reconciliation means bringing a couple together and arbitrating on their differences. This done, a couple's marriage can be relaunched, often stronger than before."</p></blockquote>
It is important to place that against the way in which they see reconciliation—within the context of marriage as a permanent state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those views are strongly held by the Cheltenham Group, and I am deeply concerned that the amendments seem to give some credibility to such concepts. I indicated to my hon. Friend the Member for Gains-borough and Horncastle that the terminology of reconciliation, in the context of the amendments, causes me concern. I am keen on the achievement of reconciliation, but reconciliation is an outcome, not a process. Marriage guidance and support services are the important things. I should have thought that that terminology was more appropriate, for use in the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, than the terminology that was used.

The definitions of legal advice, assistance and representation in section 2 of the Legal Aid Act 1988 have a common bond, in that they have regard to the application of English law. Legal aid is therefore available for justiciable issues relating to the application of English law. That is why legal aid is capable, for instance, of extension to mediation. Mediation is a means of helping the couple to resolve practical decisions about their children and their finances and property, and as such it is ultimately concerned with justiciable issues. If mediation breaks down, the couple will be able to proceed to court for an order about the arrangements, but if attempts at reconciliation fail, a court cannot order a couple to reconcile. that is an essential difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister distinguish between the case that he has just made and the right to have a will drawn up under the legal aid green form scheme? I understand that that, too, is a non-justiciable matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, the green form scheme is available to enable people to be advised on issues of English law. We are talking about legal aid provisions of the Legal Aid Act 1988, but if the hon. Gentleman's arguments is that parties who are undergoing marriage counselling could obtain that under the green form scheme, he is pursuing a route that he might, on further reflection consider inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting point. Surely the difference between making a will and what is proposed is that making a will is a justiciable declaration. That is the reason for involving lawyers. Otherwise people might find that their aims and intentions would not he carried out after their death. The question whether reconciliation can take place as if it were a justiciable issue is a separate one. At the moment, the

	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
argument of my hon. Friend the Minister seems pretty convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is surely a justiciable issue in the cases that we envisage is the dissolution or otherwise of the marriage. That is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts. If, in the course of that justiciable process, a meeting takes place between the parties to determine whether the process should continue, I fail to see how it can be argued that it is all right to provide public assistance for the purpose of mediating a continuing process, but not all right to provide it for ending the process that has been commenced. I do not understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing not that public funds should not be made available, but against the concept of using the legal aid fund and the Legal Aid Acts in the way that has been suggested—because of the point that I have illustrated, concerning the need for the relevant issues to be justiciable. The Committee has already dealt with provisions that give the Lord Chancellor the power to make grant aid available for marriage support services. The Government are clearly taking on themselves in the Bill the statutory power for such grant aiding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle may well want to promote the idea that, as well as being provided by the Government at the meeting after the information meeting, assistance should be available through the lengthier period of reflection and consideration. I do not rule out that concept. However, the amendments are not an appropriate way by which that can be achieved. Furthermore, my suspicion is that the concept of calling that process reconcilation is too much allied to the agenda that has been set out in the Cheltenham Group paper that all members of the Committee have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal for grant aid for reconciliation or marriage guidance support services in the period of reflection is one that should be actively discussed with the marriage support services themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister see his way to tabling an amendment on Report that would provide the same degree of certainty that a couple would he entitled to financial aid for marriage counselling, which is intended to effect reconciliation, as they would to receiving legal aid for mediation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly prepared to look at that as an issue, but I am not prepared to commit myself at this stage to say that I will agree to it. The concept that the hon. Gentleman has proposed is one that I am prepared to examine. However, the proposals before the Committee are unworkable and they could be dangerously misinterpreted by some people who propose that they should have an entirely different effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I interpret the hon. Gentleman as saying that he will consider whether the same degree of certainty can be afforded for the support of marriage counselling as will be afforded to support for
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
mediation? Just as the hon. Gentleman develops comparison with the Cheltenham Group, I am sure that he also understands that the converse is true. If he rejects support for reconciliation, he is challenging a great part of the populations' view of marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. What I am saying is that the Government have a great interest in ensuring that marriage support services are placed at the core of the Bill. I have given some of the technical reasons why the Committee should support the amendments even though the spirit behind them is honourable. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and I have discussed his intentions for the Bill. Before we came into Committee, we may not have seen completely eye to eye on some of its aspects and we take different standpoints on parts of it. However, on this issue, my hon. Friend's intentions are genuine. I cannot commit myself to saying that the Government will make such funding available, but I can certainly give a commitment to the hon. Member for Motherwell, South that I am prepared to consider what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has said and to see whether there is any way in which that can be carried forward. At this stage, I cannot commit myself beyond that, but it is an infinitely better proposition than the arrangements in the amendments. At best, they are incorrectly drawn and, as worst, they could be dangerously misinterpreted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend the Minister has said. He seemed to be making two points, and I hope he will forgive me—and no doubt come back on me—if I say that they are both rather weak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point was that my amendments refer to reconciliation and that, somehow in semantic terms, that is different from marriage counselling. It is not. Everyone knows what it means. If such a problem existed and the amendments were accepted, it would be possible to tidy them up on Report. However, it is clear that reconciliation means marriage counselling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second point was that this is not a justiciable matter and therefore cannot be dealt with by legal aid. We are changing the legal aid rules as we go through the Bill, so we are making them as we go along. It is not a good argument to say, "I make the legal aid rules, and the amendments do not abide by them". The hon. Member for Brent, South made the point that it would be a mad world if we devoted huge sums of public money to assisting people to divorce, but were not prepared to help people reverse that process of divorce or denied that that was in some way justiciable. We are talking about a justiciable matter: people would have already filed their statement of marital breakdown, so they would be engaged in a legal process—the clock would be ticking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No cogent argument has been advanced by my hon. Friend the Minister that would persuade me to withdraw the amendment. I am afraid that I cannot accept the argument that the Government will consider the matter, because I know what will happen. I will write to my hon. Friend the Minister to ask for money to be made available for reconciliation during the 18-month process and will receive a reply from him—I know that he wants to help me. However, at his shoulder sits the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
Treasury, which simply will not allow him to make such a commitment. Therefore it is vital, given the presence of the Treasury, that funding for reconciliation during the 18-month period be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term "reconciliation" should not be new to the Minister or have what he described as sinister or untoward—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Did not the Minister use the word "sinister"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It would be wrong to misrepresent my remarks by saying that I misunderstand what reconciliation is. I want to promote reconciliation, but my point was that reconciliation is an outcome, not a process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister's point added up to a little more than that, if I may say so. There was conjured up the spectre of an organisation, which I have not met, called the Cheltenham Group. It was somehow suggested by him that because the group had a particular notion of what was meant by reconciliation it would be in some way dangerous for that word to appear in the Bill. That cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "reconciliation" has been used by the Lord Chancellor and by the Chancellor of the Duchy time and again. The Minister, from time to time, has been known to use the term. We have had held out to us the prospect of pathways out of the solicitor's office and pathways out of mediation to explore with trained people the possibility of saving marriages that can be saved. The notion of reconciliation has a straightforward and worthy pedigree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know why the Minister mentioned the Cheltenham Group. I do not know it and have not met it, but whether one agrees with its approach to reconciliation is neither here nor there. Reconciliation is a legitimate and eminently desirable objective and it is the failure, time and again, of the Government to do more than pay lip service to the notion of reconciliation that has caused the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle to table the amendment. I admit that, on the face of it, the amendment is attractive and my hon. Friends and I are minded to vote for it, should the hon. Gentleman persist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Streeter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cynicism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. Unfortunately for those who would make such a charge, Opposition Members have from the outset condemned the Bill for not doing what it should be doing to save marriages that can be saved. The cynicism comes from those who say that the Bill is to do with family law when it has precious little to do with the family and everything to do with divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the double bind that the Government have got themselves into. They are really in the business of responding to the technocratic and Treasury-driven impulse to introduce new legislation on divorce. They never intended to do anything about the family, but have been forced to act as a result of the determination of some Conservative Members and of my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
man for allowing me to interrupt his posturing. He must deal with the question of whether reconciliation is an outcome or a process. I am astounded to hear the hon. Gentleman say that it is irrelevant, because he should know that marriage organisations are appalled at this serious misuse of terminology. That is why I expressed concern about the misinterpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very naughty of the Minister to meet one marriage group, which he deprecates in Committee, suggesting that its support for reconciliation undermines his hon. Friend's amendment, and then to pray in aid unnamed marriage organisations, suggesting that they are worried about his hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 42 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Reconciliation' means reconciliation to which Part 111A of this Act applies; and includes steps taken by a counsellor in any case in seeking to assist the parties to a marriage to be reconciled.".</p></blockquote>
That amendment, if it is accepted, would mean that the Bill will make it clear that it means marriage counselling. I am not aware of one marriage guidance organisation that opposed the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point most effectively: there is no dispute among marriage organisations about this point. If the Minister has a semantic difficulty, he can resolve it by saying that he accepts the spirit and intention of his hon. Friend's amendment and will return to the issue with a perfected proposal on Report. That is all he has to do. If the Government are serious about reconciliation as an objective public policy, whether it is a process or an outcome—I suggest that they are not—they would simply accept the spirit and intention of the amendment. The hon. Gentleman would withdraw it and that would be the end of the matter. We would all be satisfied that everything that could possibly be done to save marriages was being done. I hope that the Minister will make that course, which is open to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the distinction between process and outcome it is an interesting semantic point, but we know what the Bill's objective should be. The Minister knows that a majority in the House is in favour of the Bill containing a family aspect and if he does not understand the desire of the House to do something practical about reconciliation and to save marriages, he will not have his majority. The sooner that that is understood, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cheltenham Group affirmed my view—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I now have its briefing and I am grateful to the Minister. It made no attempt to meet me but, as the Minister has drawn it to my attention, I shall seek a meeting with the group so as not to be at a disadvantage when discussing the issue with him. The group's briefing seems to make the point that reconciliation and mediation are not the same. That is a point that we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
been making from the very beginning of the proceedings. Relate and National Family Mediation have made the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confusion about reconciliation and mediation comes not from the marriage organisations, from Opposition members of the Committee or, indeed, from the Minister's hon. Friends in the Committee, but from his Department. That is where the rot set in, because the Lord Chancellor's Department made a concerted attempt to suggest that our concerns about reconciliation were met by mediation—but they never were and they never can be. That is why the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is to the point and that is why we shall support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Brent, South will take it in a friendly spirit if I say that the only other person I have met who can switch from the temptation to strong language to becoming the verbal equivalent of a dervish is Brian Walden when the television lights go on for his LWT programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good arguments for having a social model for the country. We have economic models—some leaky and some not—and Treasury models on tax and other matters in which we can posit various relationships, vary some of them and see what the outcomes are. I wish that we had a social model that would allow us to guess at some of the links, change some factors and see what the consequences might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the arguments are about what happens after a couple, or one half of it, has applied for a divorce, the distinction between reconciliation and mediation is not all that important. I take as a middle-of-the-road example the case of a couple in which both parties believe that a divorce is appropriate and mediation takes place to try to resolve issues still in dispute. If the parties decide, because of the cooling-off period, mediation or some other factor, that they do not want to go ahead with the divorce, that is their decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At some stage, if legal aid has been made available for mediation, the lawyer, or someone else, will have to ask whether the application is being withdrawn, because if it is, that is clearly a movement from mediation in a divorce to another kind of arrangement. I suspect that, in practical terms, the Lord Chancellor's Department will have to find a way of saying to people involved in mediation that there comes a time, in such circumstances, when a line has to be drawn. Does that happen when the application is withdrawn? Does the couple have to make some positive move? Is there a professional duty on the mediator to say, "I'm afraid that this is moving from mediation to reconciliation" or to decide that reconciliation has taken place? I do not regard as major the problem of where the boundary lies. It is interesting, because it demonstrates that it is not simply a question of one extreme or another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, my hon. Friend is describing something that already happens. In many mediation circumstances, especially when organisations such as Relate are involved, couples move from mediation to marriage guidance without any serious difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second set of circumstances in my mind is one in which one half of the couple has applied for the divorce and the other does not want it to go ahead. Under the present laws, it would inevitably go ahead after five years unless grounds were established for a shorter period. Under the Bill, if one half of the couple says, "I want reconciliation" and the other half says, "I want mediation", does that mean that only one of them can receive legal aid? I am not trying to make life complicated, but we must accept that mediation and legal aid will apply if one person has petitioned for divorce. Let us suppose that the other person goes into mediation, but says, "I may throw my weight into the conciliation process of mediation, but I would really like reconciliation. I would like to restore good relations and for the marriage to continue." I hope that legal aid will be available not only to the person who applied for mediation and, in effect, the divorce—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight flaw in the hon. Gentleman's argument. There cannot be reconciliation when only one party wants it. Either both parties want it or neither of them wants it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One reason why I have not been very successful in my chosen calling is that I am bad at communicating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone petitions for a divorce, mediation becomes part of that process. Under the provision, legal aid would be available for mediation. If the other party to the marriage becomes involved in mediation, but really wants reconciliation and the marriage to continue, I hope that legal aid would be available to both parties, not just to the one who petitioned for divorce. I was not making a more complicated point than that, although I may have put it in a complex way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely we have established that to mediate both parties must be willing to do so. Even more important, if reconciliation is wanted, both parties must be willing to be reconciled. It would not work if only one party wanted to be reconciled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any direct experience yet of such matters, but indirect experience leads me to believe that, in a fair number of divorce petitions, only one half of the couple wants to break up the marriage. It is also true that most people who get married intend the marriage to last. They do not suddenly have a blinding revelation that it is over or that it will not work. Such matters happen out of step,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no division in the Committee that reconciliation is a good thing; there is common agreement that it should happen more often. But why should one have to wait until someone has applied for a divorce for a funding mechanism for reconciliation? I may have misunderstood, but, under the amendment, legal aid would be made available for reconciliation after a divorce application has been submitted. I am not making a distinction between reconciliation and mediation, but between reconciliation before or after a divorce application has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
We must consider whether legal aid should be the source of funding for a couple who are after reconciliation. I do not think that I shall get very far on the issue of what happens when one party wants, a divorce and mediation, but the other party does not want the marriage to be dissolved and wants reconciliation. However, why should there be a different source of funding for reconciliation, whether or not there has been an application for divorce?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that a couple both want reconciliation, whether or not a divorce application has been made. What are they asking for? Marriage guidance. If we are arguing that the amendment does not deal with reconciliation in divorce cases, funded by legal aid, but with legal aid funding for marriage guidance, we have entered a new area that should be considered on its own merits and not necessarily as part of the Bill. Earlier, I referred to the disparity of public resources that are spent on divorce compared with trying to save marriages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This part of the Bill could be called the remarriage provisions. If a couple move from mediation to reconciliation, there would not be a major practical problem, although the amendment excites some debate. In what circumstances will that couple continue to need the legal aid fund to support those helping them to become reconciled? As long as neither the solicitor nor whoever else receives the legal aid unduly extends the process, which will have moved from mediation to the act of reconciliation, they are in the clear. We come back to the underlying point that we need effective funding as well as effective help for those whose marriages have broken down. Some hon. Members would go further and talk about help for those whose relationships have broken down, whether children and parents or partners unmarried but living together, but that might go beyond the scope of the amendment and the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should not accept the amendment. I do not say that because I do not believe in reconciliation. I was one of the first hon. Members to introduce debates on family policy back in 1978 when the House of Commons Library had no such thing as family policy documentation. In another debate in 1982—I along with others who are now in the Room even if they are not members of the Committee—helped to create a family forum devoted to helping families function more effectively in the early 1980s and to giving people the confidence and competence to carry out their responsibilities to each other—not only in marriage but to their children and their elderly parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not delay the Committee. We should not accept the amendment, which it would be better not to
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
press to a vote. We should put extra effort into making reconciliation services available when people want them. There is little point in a couple saying that they need help with their problems if they have to join a long queue and do not move forward for months. They are then more likely to apply for divorce and to require mediation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming rather confused. The whole intention of the Bill is to recognise that many people get divorced after travelling the long road of a broken marriage and a gradual growing apart. As court welfare officers have reminded us, the vast majority of people fall into that category. The Lord Chancellor's original interests when the Bill was drafted, was to stop the quickie divorce, which went through too quickly without all the options being properly considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, at the beginning of the process, achieved a period of three months during which people can be offered mediation on a voluntary basis before making the statement that sets off the waiting period, when they again think matters through for, it is hoped, another 15 months before the divorce is made absolute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people will find that mediation works for them, but only a small percentage of people will fall into that category. As a result of mediation, they may decide to become reconciled and to pull out of the process, but I do not see why that needs to be done on legal aid. I do not understand how legal aid comes into the argument. As someone who has been through a divorce, I know exactly how one ponders over the various questions; I do not understand how a couple who want to be reconciled need the help of legal aid. If we are not careful, we shall make it such a long drawn out process, with so many options, that we shall lose sight of what we seek to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle spoke about not setting up a quango for the mediation system—of not setting up a new industry of mediators who would benefit from the additional resources that the Government and the Legal Aid Board would put into that more civilised way of ending marriage. But here he goes again, wanting to set up an extra quango of reconcilers, also available on legal aid, ready to move in if required. Where does that fit into the long drawn out process that we have discussed on the Floor of the House and in Committee? It would be charitable to say that it was merely another hurdle put in the way of creating a more civilised way to end marriage—making arrangements for all the matters that we have listed, especially the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the consistency or logic in the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. We are making a big improvement by ending instant divorces, with their ancillary problems. We have moved to the front of the Bill the provision that allows time for people to take advice and become involved in mediation. At that stage, a few people may decide not to proceed with the statement, but now—after statements have been made and after people have gone to mediation—we are talking about creating another avenue for reconciliation through the legal aid system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
It cannot help to drag matters on for so long. If people are prepared to be reconciled, they will go ahead, possibly with great joy. Having looked into the abyss, and having listened to the mediator explaining the consequences of the action that they were about to take, they may decide not to go ahead, but it should be no part of the system for the mediator to say that a little reconciliation on legal aid might save the marriage. That is not likely to be the true reaction to the Bill's purpose. I am all for people thinking twice—even three or four times—before making the final decision that their marriage is at an end. However, the marriages of the vast majority of people who have got that far have been dying for a long time. If there was any prospect of reconciliation, it would have happened even before they started seeking advice as to how they could end the marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for Eltham and for Broxtowe for bringing a sense of reality to our debate. When I responded to the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gains-borough and Horncastle, I spelled out the workability of his proposals—and I stand by those observations. Those matters have not been sufficiently answered. They have been overtaken by the effort to ensure that a high profile is given to marriage support services, and I share my hon. Friend's concern about that. The contribution of the hon. Member for Brent, South was a diminution of the real difficulties in relation to the practical proposals that we are discussing, and there was some posturing on his part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said that what I was concerned about was the Treasury and that the Treasury is on my shoulder preventing me from agreeing with his proposal. He implied that people in the reflection and consideration period who wanted to take advantage of marriage guidance would be prevented from doing so by a wicked Treasury insisting that money should rather be spent on proceeding with the divorce process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a great deal of sympathy with much of what my hon. Friend has said, but I do not believe that his proposition is viable or that there is much to support his claim. As he said—my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury put his finger on it—given the stage of the process we are talking about, the amendments would, sadly, affect only a limited number of cases. We are not dealing with Treasury considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On many issues that we have discussed before and during the Committee stage, we have been able to reach agreement, but surely the point here is that if there are very few cases, the cost will be very little and will make little difference. However, to save even one marriage is a worthwhile exercise in itself and would fund the conciliation of many marriages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But What I have said, and what I repeat now, is that I strongly believe that the mechanism proposed in the amendments is flawed. I have examined the definition of reconciliation given by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. Those who are promoting the concept that reconciliation is a form of arbitration of individual disputes within the perma-
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
nence of marriage would find nothing objectionable in that definition. That is one of the reasons I believe that the proposed process would have some of the difficulties that I highlighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has been aiming to achieve is the same as that proposed by the hon. Member for Motherwell, South who asked whether, at that late stage of the reflection and consideration period, we should provide assistance so that people can receive marriage guidance if they are not able to afford it through their own means. I fully accept the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe; it is unrealistic to expect that there will be many such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I am fully prepared to give serious consideration to the points raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle and for Canterbury, but I do not believe that the mechanism proposed in the amendments is satisfactory. What I shall seek to do is make use of the Lord Chancellor's power to grant aid to marriage support services. That is the mechanism that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle proposed initially—he suggested that that power should be used to make available the support for someone who has been referred to a marriage counselling interview after the information meeting. That is a more sensible mechanism for the delivery of what my hon. Friend is seeking to achieve than that proposed in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle what his real interest is in proposing such a structure. I have outlined the difficulties of that structure and I strongly believe that the amendments could be misinterpreted, not in terms of reconciliation but because of the interests of some of the participants in this debate. I have not deprecated their views, as the hon. Member for Brent, South claimed. Everyone in the debate approaches the Bill with their own strong moral views. I have never deprecated the views of anyone who has contributed to the debate, even though I might have disagreed about certain matters. However, it has been suggested that such a structure of arbitration and reconciliation was the proper method of dealing with disputes within marriage. That is my core concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle really wanted to ensure that those who did not have the means to use that process of reflection and consideration could take advantage of marriage guidance services, and if he wanted me to give an assurance that we would use the grant-aiding power of the Lord Chancellor's Department to provide that, I would say that that would be an infinitely preferable way to deal with such matters. I would be prepared to give that proposal serious consideration and table an amendment on Report to give effect to it. If, however, my hon. Friend is arguing for something different, such as the other proposal to which reference has been made, I would say that it would not be a workable proposition for the reasons that I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Gains-borough and Horncastle will think that that is a fair offer in the circumstances. I have endeavoured to address the concern that he has outlined. I understand
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
that his core interest is to ensure that such support is made available to people during the period of reflection and consideration. I have outlined in as honest and detailed a way as possible some of my concerns about the mechanism that my hon. Friend has proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle will allow me to consider how an amendment can be formulated along the lines that I have outlined, and if he will accept my assurance that I will seek to table such an amendment on Report, I would hope that that deals with his point without causing the problems to which I referred. I still think that the mechanism that my hon. Friend proposed would cause such problems. I hope that he thinks that that deals with the spirit of his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister has not gone far enough. He is a very honourable man, and he is trying to do his best in a difficult situation, but he has promised to give the matter serious consideration only. I do not doubt that he will give it serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us not argue semantics. I will give serious consideration to the formulation of an amendment, and I will table an amendment to give effect to the spirit, as I understand it, of my hon. Friend's amendment. I have said that that must be done within the context of using the grant-aiding power of the Lord Chancellor's Department, rather than the mechanism that my hon. Friend has proposed. I have made that clear, so there is no room for mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend guarantee that he will table an amendment on Report which will ensure that every couple who seek reconciliation during the 18-month period will be funded to the same extent as those who seek mediation? Will my hon. Friend give that guarantee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will table an amendment to make provision for the use of the Lord Chancellor's grant-aiding power to ensure that marriage services are made available during such a period of reflection and consideration. My hon. Friend would not expect me to detail the precise terms of such an amendment now. However, I would seek to use the mechanism that the my hon. Friend suggested—using the Lord Chancellor's grant-aiding power for the initial meeting after the information meeting. That meets my hon. Friend's concerns, and I am surprised that he finds it difficult to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are gradually inching towards an understanding, but it is important to be absolutely clear. A few moments ago, my hon. Friend the Minister said that he would give the matter serious consideration. He has now given a guarantee. We are told that my hon. Friend the Minister will guarantee the amendment—being a representative of the Government, he is now bound by that. I want him to guarantee not only that he will ensure that funding is made available generally through organisations such as Relate, but that an amendment will be tabled on Report to ensure that a couple seeking reconciliation services without the 18-month period will have funding attached to them personally—not to the organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can support that. My hon. Friend the Minister's proposals would be more useful than the method suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister was more convinced by what was said earlier about the different mechanism and route to providing reconciliation services. I do not want an open-ended commitment, so that any couple can apply for any sort of reconciliation service from virtually anyone for any length of time. In those circumstances, we could find ourselves in all sorts of difficulties. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister has convinced the Committee that his proposals will be more welcomed by the recognised marriage guidance organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am asking for is not open-ended—it will end within the 18-month period. Perhaps I expressed myself badly. The case must be subject to legal aid rules. It would be absurd if a wealthy person, with unlimited resources, could simply call on expensive reconciliation services. That is why I framed my amendment in that way. The Committee knows what I want. My hon. Friend the Minister has gone so far already and he is now making guarantees, so I should have thought that it would be easy for him to make it absolutely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is trying to bring in his proposals is not the right way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are pushing too far. Each case that comes through that process might cost considerably more than any legal aid grants. We are juggling figures. If we were to divide the grant with the number of cases that come through the process, I suspect that it would cost significantly more money per head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a characteristic of people who are going through the trauma of divorce that they are willing to accept long periods of conversation with support services—not necessarily usefully if the people involved are not particularly skilled. They may end up with a charlatan who is unable to help them but who may be a sympathetic character. It could be an open-ended commitment leading to considerable expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped for a more generous response from my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle because, in essence, I have accepted the principle of his amendment. I highlighted the difficulties regarding the structure of what he has outlined, but, beyond that, I have accepted the principle. Usually, if a Minister accepts the principle of an amendment what he has to say in Committee is accepted by hon. Members, and I hope that my hon. Friend will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept my hon. Friend's assurances, but we are discussing a serious matter and we must be clear about what we are considering. I am grateful for my hon. Friend the Minister's commitment to table an amendment on Report. However, I want to ensure that he is not considering block grants, but seeks guarantees of individual entitlement, subject to legal aid rules, or other rules that he may set, for a limited 18-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not logical. It means that anyone who wants to obtain money for reconciliation, and to qualify for legal aid would have to apply for a divorce to be guaranteed, whereas those who do not apply for a divorce will not get the money. My hon. Friend the Minister's comments provide the best reassurances for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not in the dark. Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle proposed a mechanism to deal with those matters through a reference to marriage counselling, and a way in which to fund it. I believe that I had made it clear that I would consider similar means to effect the principles of his amendments. I hope that he would support that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I now understand. I am close to withdrawing the amendment. My hon. Friend the Minister said that he had already agreed to fund an initial meeting for marriage counselling before the statement is filed. He guarantees to propose on Report funding on the same basis for further reconciliation meetings, if both parties want that. In view of that guarantee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This will be a much less painful experience for the Minister. However, the subject causes considerable anxiety for Opposition Members. I hope that some Conservative Members will support the amendment, but, to date, we have been disappointed. Whenever we have raised an issue that relates to violence against women, Conservative Members have not supported us. There tends to be a cross-party approach to reconciliation, but it breaks down when violence against women is considered. Therefore, we are unable to obtain a positive response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come off it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that that is true. That is to be deprecated—I use the word advisedly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a disgraceful introduction. There is no difference between the parties on violence against women.

Member for Stockton, South wants to have his cake and eat it. He cannot vote against an amendment to the Bill that would, as a general principle, afford protection against violence against either spouse or children. The Government voted against another amendment which would provide the same thing—protection against violence for information meetings—and then say that there is unanimity about violence in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes my point well. I need only say that whenever such amendments have been tabled by the Opposition, even though they have received the support of the hon. Member for Batley and Spen—she must be given the credit and our gratitude for that—who urged the Minister to accept them, the Minister has never accepted them. An opportunity has been found on every occasion to avoid accepting such amendments. That is to be deprecated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has been moved tonight because we are anxious to underline our belief that mediation is not appropriate and cannot play a useful role where there is violence directed against women. We want to tease out from the Minister what he envisages here. What role does the inclusion of part IV play? How will we be assisted as a Committee in meeting the objectives we have set set ourselves for mediation by its application in relation to instances of domestic violence under part IV of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an exploratory amendment. All the evidence, and this is certainly the experience of the Family Law Bill coalition, is that mediation is not appropriate where domestic violence is present. One can well see why that should be the case. It is not necessary to rehearse the concerns that have been expressed in the past about the nature of oppressive relationships and their tendency to replicate themselves in the course of the mediation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know in any event from such research as has been carried out that parties, particularly those where there has been some form of violence, are likely to present themselves for mediation. The research on the efficacy of mediation has been in relation to a relatively small and self-selecting group of people who tend to be drawn from a section of society that is perhaps more comfortable articulating emotions and the philosophy of mediation than another. That problem will have to be explored during the course of the pilot project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see how the Minister envisages the clause will operate in relation to part IV. We tabled the amendment to ascertain that and our proper attitude to it. It is an important amendment, which reiterates a concern that has been expressed by many groups involved with mediation and the professional support of couples in crisis. We hope that the Minister will be able to meet that concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not able to accept the amendment. I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for indicating at the outset that the amendment is primarily a probing one. He said that I need to be probed on this matter because he is unaware of the Government's view on part IV and mediation matters. In fact, when we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
debated amendments to clause 26 earlier, I indicated to the Committee the way in which it was intended that the rebuttable presumption might be operated in mediation cases. I made clear at the time, but shall reiterate for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman, that it was intended that there would be certain types of case in which the presumption would automatically be rebutted. Those would be public law Children Act cases or cases in which parties were applying for protection measures against domestic violence under part IV. The hon. Gentleman suggested that that point was not addressed earlier, but specific mention was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of removing altogether the provision of part IV from the definition of family matters for the purpose of mediation would be that mediation provided under the Legal Aid Act 1988 would not be available for any questions that arise under part IV. I understand that the purpose of the measure might be to ensure that the victims of domestic violence are not forced into mediation. However, I say to the hon. Gentleman that I agree that violence is not negotiable. Where there is continuing violence, mediation will not be appropriate. That is why my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor made clear during debates on this matter in the other place that cases of domestic violence would be included in the prescribed description of proceedings, where the rebuttable presumption applied and where I have said in debates today that we hold that it should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV of the Bill contains provisions that are not directly related to the incidence of domestic violence; for example, occupation orders and transfer of tenancies. Those do not necessarily turn on incidents of domestic violence and I would not wish parties in such situations to be denied the opportunity of resolving their difficulties through mediation provided under the legal aid system if that is what they elect to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for a wide interpretation of family matters, ensuring that legal aid for mediation may be available in as many proceedings as possible connected with the breakdown of a marriage. That is right and proper so that the alternative process of dispute resolution may be applied in as many appropriate situations as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also right that regulations should provide that there are certain types of case in which mediation will not be presumed to be a better method of resolving difficulties than litigation. Let me make clear to the Committee that cases involving domestic violence fall into that category, as do the public law Children Act cases to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody would seek to exclude the entire Children Act from the definition of family matters even though it is clearly acknowledged that there are certain cases in which mediation would not be appropriate. I hope that that is an explanation of the Government's reasoning in the context of domestic violence, and ties in with what I said to the Committee earlier in the debate regarding the operation of clause 26.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was under no illusions about the Minister's remarks on clause 26. I wanted to tease out the Government's attitude towards clause 23 through the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
There are concerns on the Opposition side about the Minister's references to continuing violence. We, and those concerned in providing mediation, share concern that an incident of violence, which may have ended, may end the relationship of trust and security that is essential if agreement is to be reached by both parties and be sustainable. Quite apart from whether an agreement is just and does not simply replicate an already oppressive situation, a sustainable agreement cannot be reached if the basis of trust has been undermined by an act of violence. I seek some assurances from the Minister on the use of the word "continuing" because violence may not be continuing, but nevertheless may be destructive and corrosive of the relationship appropriate to mediation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On occupation, if an order has been made in the past, it is difficult to see how mediation is likely to be appropriate later. The relationship had deteriorated to such an extent that it was necessary to remove one party from the scene. Can the Minister envisage circumstances in which mediation would be appropriate in the aftermath of such an occurrence? We cannot. We wait to see what the Minister's final attitude will be on clause 26, but would be anxious to avoid any suggestion that mediation would be somehow more appropriate and deserving of legal aid than a court/lawyer-based remedy would be. Further assurance would be welcomed on those two issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the incidents to which the hon. Gentleman refers should be approached with caution. I have made it clear that I anticipate that jurisdiction would be ousted in specific categories. The hon. Gentleman will recall that in what I said about clause 26, I indicated the Government's willingness to engage in further consultation about further categories that might fall within the remit of that general presumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that when there has ever been an allegation of violence within a marital relationship, that allegation should lead to the jurisdiction of mediation under part IV being automatically ousted, I should need to be persuaded of his case. If he is suggesting that mediation may not be appropriate in many such cases, there is not much difference between us. But if he is arguing that mediation would never be appropriate in such a case, I am less inclined to follow his route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instances that the hon. Gentleman has highlighted need to be approached with caution, but I do not think that they should necessarily oust the jurisdiction of mediation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most interested in what my hon. Friend says. He appears to be moving towards the position that I find more attractive and acceptable, in that mediation is just as appropriate as proceedings, but there will be no presumption in favour of one party or the other. Will my hon. Friend give me an idea of his thoughts about that in view of our debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of clause 26, I am seeking to deal with that category of cases in which mediation should not be a prospect at all, and people are not even

	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
required to go to the initial meeting. I am keen for people to attend a first meeting, and I think that my hon. Friend understands why. Her concern is to ensure that mediation is regarded as just as appropriate as legal proceedings. I am prepared to support her in principle, although I do so within the context of promoting the line that the initial assessment meeting should still take place. I hope that that answers my hon. Friend's earlier point and gives her the reassurance that she seeks. She is keen that mediation should not be elevated above the availability of legal services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that the Bill will provide that one will be as appropriate as the other, so that a level playing field will be created?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will arrange for that to be included in the Bill and, as I said earlier, the initial meeting with the mediator must also in those circumstances be attended. I think that, in fairness to my hon. Friend, she understands why I am so attracted to retaining that element. Beyond that, I accept the principle of what she says, and I will arrange for a suitable provision to be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay that he will seek on Report for the Bill to provide that mediation on family matters is just as appropriate as legal proceedings. Surely "as appropriate" means that people will not be required to go to the mediation meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that I am not going to give up the principle that people should have the opportunity of that first meeting with the mediator. My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay has been concerned throughout that people should not have to follow one particular course of action. She wants a level playing field. She argued for mediation to be considered just as appropriate as legal services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have argued that a core part of my approach is that in cases that do not satisfy the test to which I referred earlier, there should be an initial meeting with the mediator to consider suitability. That will be provided for in the context of the sort of amendment that I will introduce. It will cover the voluntariness of this course, and will be considered against the background of mediation being, in due course, no more appropriate than legal proceedings. I think that answers my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the interesting points raised by the hon. Members for Billericay and for Gainsborough and Horncastle, will the Minister confirm that although the parties will be required to attend a mediation meeting, if they say afterwards, "This is not for us", it will not be held against them in any decision on legal aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman was here for our debate earlier today. That issue is the core of the points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, on which I gave him a range of assurances about the voluntariness of the principle. My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay has expressed
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
her concern about the precise terminology in the measure. I reiterate what I have made clear previously—that it is important that the initial suitability meeting with the mediator should take place in those cases that are not covered by the presumptions that I mentioned earlier. If my hon. Friend remains concerned about the terminology, I am happy to agree in principle that in the relevant circumstances mediation should be considered as appropriate as legal services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That agreement does not detract from the assurances that I gave to my hon Friend the Member for Broxtowe about voluntariness. I hope that clarifies the matter for all hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just sped through several clauses, which I do not propose to debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just warn the Committee about some contentious issues that arise on the ability of men to remain in houses—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman wants to debate clause 42 he may—but he cannot debate clauses that have already been ordered to stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just warning the Committee, in relation to clause 42, about the preceding clauses, as they relate to the ability of a man to remain in the home to which he has sole occupation rights, after he is challenged as to those rights and a charge is put on them. Clause 42 would allow ex parte non-molestation orders, and orders on other matters, to be made—which would enable people to be put out of their homes on the basis of injunctions granted by a court at which the man was not heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Committee to be clear that we are dealing with fundamental powers, including those in clause 44 that deal with arrest for breach of an order. The clause is an important matter that people might like to consider in a little more depth rather than simply saying "Aye" to every single issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say two things. The first relates to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent, which he was right to raise. Clause 42(2)(a) and (b) both refer to when an
	<br><blockquote><p>"order is not made immediately".</p></blockquote>
That suggests a degree of urgency. Without that urgency, I do not think that an order would be made.

Secondly, I recognise that my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) saw my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor at the end of the previous parliamentary session. I was slightly surprised that clause 42 did not find its way through after my amendment at the last moment of the previous parliamentary session, but the Lord Chancellor deserves credit for accepting that there were worries on which hon. Members alighted late in the proceedings. The way that the Lord Chancellor has dealt with the matter should be commended to other Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal with some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Stockton, South. There is nothing unusual about such orders—they appear in other matrimonial legislation. The hon. Gentleman will know that if an ex parte order is made to remove an alleged violent person from a home, he or she will have his or her say at a full hearing as soon as convenient, whereupon the order could be reversed. There is nothing new in the orders. They are not fundamentally different from any other matrimonial order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my experience, I know that courts are wary of making ex parte orders unless they have pretty good evidence. They try to convene as soon as possible, to allow the ousted party to have his or her full say. There is nothing fundamentally revolutionary or different about the provisions for orders in this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am aware of the way in which ex parte, non-molestation orders work at present. In breaking up the relentless braying of "Aye" to every clause as we slid quickly through the proceedings, I was seeking to point out to my hon. Friends, who are not lawyers, and to those outside interested in the subject that there is a strong feeling that it is not always just and convenient for an allegation of violence to put a person out of the house to which he has the right of occupancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody wants a violent relationship to continue or a poor person who is being afflicted with violence in his or her home being subjected to that treatment for any longer than necessary. Of course there will always be the necessity for such orders to be made. However clause 42(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court may, in any case where it considers that it is just and convenient to do so, make an occupation order or a non-molestation order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court."</p></blockquote>
The clause goes on to outline how to determine the exercise of such powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the feeling that many of the men who have visited my surgery have expressed. They think that the law is stacked against them and that the system works solely and almost entirely to the benefit of women. I shall quote one paragraph from a letter that I received from my constituent Eric Young:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A man will leave his marriage or seek to end it, knowing invariably, he will lose his children, his home and a large slice of his income. A woman does the same safe in the knowledge she will retain everything. Why is it that the so called 'experts' on the subject do not pick up on this and highlight such an obvious cause for the increase in divorce? Could it be because it is mainly women who seem to be predominantly involved in such issues?"</p></blockquote>
I shall not quote at great length from his letter because I have made the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
Currently, there exists the opportunity for people to make unfounded allegations of violence against their partners and to have them removed from the home. Whether we like it or not, it is sometimes difficult for such people to overcome—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, please let me finish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes difficult for such people to overcome the allegations that have been made against them. One of the more unpleasant sides of the current law of divorce and family breakdown is that there are occasions when spouses who are in a deteriorating relationship think it to their best advantage to make such allegations, even if they are not true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consideration of ex parte orders may not be anything new, but even though it is 11.15 pm we might like to stop—that is all that I was saying when I briefly stopped the Committee from saying "Aye" to everything—to consider for a moment whether we want the law to continue in such a way or whether, we could build in any possible safeguard to make the matters fairer and safer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will respond to the points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South to reassure the Committee on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the power of the court to make occupation orders and non-molestation orders on an ex parte basis. It is of great importance that ex parte orders should be available in cases of actual or threatened violence. Such circumstances tend to occur more frequently in family disputes than in other types of litigation because the parties are often still in close contact and in a state of high emotional tension. We all understand that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in such cases, however, the court should grant an ex parte order only in exceptional circumstances, where the interests of justice or the protection of the applicant or a child clearly demand immediate intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause specifies the criteria that the court must consider when hearing an application for an ex parte order. They cover situations in which there is a risk of significant harm to the applicant or relevant child attributable to the conduct of the respondent—that amendment was put into the Bill as a result of observations that were made in the other place—unless an order is made immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the applicant is terrified of the respondent, some protection may be necessary to enable the applicant—as my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South said, that is frequently the wife—to pursue a remedy. That is also the case when respondents are deliberately evading service. Sadly, evading service is often used by respondents in domestic violence cases as a tactic to wear down the applicant's resolution. The balance of justice and of convenience may be in favour of making an ex parte order with a short return date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill specifically provides that where an ex parte order is made the respondent must be given the oppor-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
tunity to make representations about the order as soon as is just and convenient at a hearing of which all parties will have been notified. The clause also ensures that where an occupation order under clause 33 or clause 35 is made ex parte, an non-entitled applicant will not be prevented from obtaining an initial order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the way in which those matters have been and will be dealt with by the court in relation to the Bill—specifically clause 42—means that no judge would grant such an order without seeing convincing evidence, such as photographs of injuries or affidavit evidence which could later be tested in court? No judge lightly throws any person out of his house. The comments made by the hon. Member for Stockton, South smelled of misogamy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) made that remark because my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South was right to call the Committee's attention to the details. It is clear from his remarks that he not only has experience of the area of law with which we are dealing but has received correspondence from his constituents on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are under an obligation to bring those experiences to our debate. My hon. Friend is right to raise his concerns. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for intervening and allowing me to say that the circumstances in which ex parte orders would be granted are exceptional ones in which the interests of justice or protection of the applicant or a child demand immediate intervention. The hon. Member for Bristol, East made that point in her intervention, to balance the concerns outlined by my hon. Friend's constituent. In the circumstances, we should support the clause, although my hon. Friend's observations focused the Committee's attention on the details and how matters raised
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
in the other place have been dealt with in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to reinforce the excellent contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South. The Minister is right to say how glad Conservative Members were about the insertion of the word "conduct". Without it, it would have been possible to expel people who had not actually done anything wrong. Its inclusion means that there is some morality in a critical clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an interesting link between this clause and schedule 2. I second the allegation made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South, that occasionally grossly unfair applications are made on the basis of false allegations. It is sad that the general provisions on conduct, to which we shall return in schedule 2, are such that in one test case, which has already been referred to, a judge ruled that the making of the kind of allegations on oath to which my hon. Friend referred, and securing the eviction of the husband as a result, together with a whole string of other offences, did not amount to misconduct sufficient to be taken into account by the court. That is why we shall return to the matter in schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
