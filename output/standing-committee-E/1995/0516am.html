<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In returning to the subject of domestic violence, we are emphasising the extent of the problem. Concern about the matter is not only felt here. Out there in the country, one of the most significant cosmetic retailers is running a campaign entitled "Blow the Whistle". It is geared specifically to heightening public awareness of the scale of the problem of domestic violence—so much so, that the company is receiving postcards, at the rate of 150 a day, highlighting the concern of members of the public.<br><br>
The amendments would dispel the widespread perception that the law does not deal with domestic violence. I am referring to the practical application of the law. Its accessibility and flexibility in dealing with a complex and high volatile phenomenon is at a premium. The law counts for very little unless it can provide a practical remedy for those seeking redress.<br><br>
In their entireity, the amendments seek to preserve the courts' use of the undertaking, making it available to victims of domestic violence and enabling a power of arrest to be attached. The amendments seek to deal with a real worry—not only among professional advisers but among those working in the women's refuge movement and elsewhere—that the Bill may make undertakings less readily available and less effective in dealing with the problems presented by domestic violence.<br><br>
One thinks, in that regard, particularly of the remarks and writings of District Judge Stephen Gerlis, who in praising the effectiveness of undertakings, expresses the view that the Bill may have inadvertently—almost by a side wind—blown them away as an effective remedy. We seek to emphasise their importance, to make them available where at present they might not be available, and to enable a power of arrest to be attached to them. The reason for that additional power is that solemn undertakings should be backed up, to provide a speedy and effective redress. The notion that an undertaking can be taken lightly—that breaching it will not have serious consequences—must be dispelled. We seek to do just that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 19 proposes the use of magistrates courts as a venue for obtaining orders. That, too, was referred to by District Judge Stephen Gerlis, in the January edition of <i>Family Law.</i> He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are very good reasons for this"—</p></blockquote>
he is referring to the use of magistrates courts—because
<br><blockquote><p>"the procedure in the magistrates' courts is very much simpler than in the county court".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates Courts Act 1978 led to an attempt
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 309</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"to persuade applicants and their legal advisers to head in the direction of magistrates' court for their injunctions rather than the county court because the costs involved appeared to be less."</p></blockquote>
That is another attraction of using magistrates courts.<br><br>
The fact that the procedures are simpler means that magistrates courts are more readily usable by those who do not, for one reason or another, have the services of a lawyer, and we should take that, too, into account. The cuts in eligibility for legal aid have left some women especially vulnerable to spouses or partners who are prepared to exploit that lack of means and ready access to professional advice and assistance because they themselves have difficulty in funding representation.<br><br>
Magistrates courts are attractive to many who do not have lawyers because their procedures are simpler, there is not the reliance on affidavit evidence that there is elsewhere, and it is possible to give evidence on oath in the witness box to obtain an order. The court draws up the papers and arranges the necessary documentation.<br><br>
There is one disadvantage to magistrates courts, in that their power to commit for contempt is less useful in exercising a deterrent effect, because the order is limited to two months as opposed to the County Court's two years. Nevertheless, magistrates courts are an increasingly attractive venue, and the amendments would ensure that they had the power to accept undertakings.<br><br>
The amendments would allow us to use every venue and mechanism available to law in order to get to grips practically with the menace of domestic violence. It is in that spirit that I commend them to the Committee, and I trust that they will find widespread support and acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support amendment No. 79, which I tabled, because I believe that clauses 43 and 44 taken together produce an unhelpful anomaly, which I am sure was not intended.<br><br>
Under clause 44, a power of arrest is automatically attached to an occupation or non-molestation order, except where the court believes that there is adequate protection without it; but under clause 43(3), no undertaking can be accepted by the court if a power of arrest has been attached under another part of the Bill.<br><br>
The combined effect of those two elements was described by Judge Stephen Gerlis in <i>Family Law</i> in December 1995. He wrote that
<br><blockquote><p>"where there has been violence or a threatened violence the court is effectively prevented from accepting an undertaking."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Committee shares my belief that it cannot be right for the Bill to prevent courts from accepting undertakings.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) made some good points in this respect today and on Second Reading he quoted another part of Judge Stephen Gerlis's excellent article, in which the judge wrote that undertakings
<br><blockquote><p>"'have clear advantages—they reduce confrontation, they avoid the need for full, often lengthy hearings and findings of fact, there are no winners and losers thus mitigating feelings of resentment. Because of these effects, they are breached somewhat less than injunctions. To
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
put it plainly—they are popular and they work"'—[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 March 1996; Vol. 274, c.756.]</p></blockquote>
10.45 am<br><br>
I am very happy to agree with the hon. Member for Brent, South on this point. However, I cannot agree with him totally and support amendment No. 18. As well as deleting subsection (3)—as my amendment would—amendment No. 18 would delete subsection (2). That would enable a court to attach a power of arrest to an undertaking, and I should not like the draconian powers under part IV to be extended further. In general, however, the hon. Member for Brent, South made a sensible point. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the amendment. Although there has been an enormous increase in the number of reported incidents of domestic violence, we know that many people do not report violence in the home. Clearly, domestic violence is one of the most appalling crimes that people commit against each other. We should make it easier for people to have confidence in legal processes so that they report incidents of domestic violence and, therefore, take advantage of those processes.<br><br>
Why are so many women petrified of reporting such incidents to the police and entering into the arena of the legal system? There are various reasons, one of which is the difficulty of obtaining legal aid, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South said. Under the amendments, people would not have to go through the legal aid process, as the amendments would allow the use of the undertakings mechanism. Hence the amendments should be welcomed.<br><br>
The victims of domestic violence are put off largely for other reasons. Often, they are involved with other problems. For example, alcohol misuse might influence how they deal with the situation. Drug dependence, too, might influence their willingness to undertake the difficult process of obtaining legal aid and going to court. Constant or chronic depression might make it difficult for them to litigate. The amendment should be supported because it eases the way to ensuring protection for women. I hope that the Minister will indeed support it.<br><br>
I was slightly surprised that there was some worry about the power of arrest. Our criminal justice system does not do enough to support the cause of women who suffer domestic violence. If undertakings were to go wrong and there was no power of arrest so that a third party could support the victims' cause and make their lives easier, we would damage our intention of recognising the atrocities linked with domestic violence. The power of arrest is important—it is a sort of stopgap that allows women to feel that there is someone working with them rather than the onus being entirely on them to find support through the courts and the criminal justice system.<br><br>
This is a huge and growing problem and it is commendable that the Committee has spent a considerable time on it. I hope that the amendments will be unanimously agreed. That will send a message to women who are suffering horrific domestic abuse but are too frightened to seek advice, support and redress,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 311</span>
telling them that the system is with, rather than against, them and that all, the processes of the law, including the police, will be used to ensure that they can live safely in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a danger that if the power of arrest is too widely available, it will become one of the mechanisms for loading presuppositions about behaviour, which will have a knock-on effect on decisions on how property should be divided, the care of the children and so on. While I am fully aware that the overwhelming preponderance of violence is perpetrated by men against women, I have had correspondence again today confirming that there is a significant incidence of violence by women against men. It is a great mistake to suggest that that does not happen. Indeed, there are some signs, as I have said before, that the recourse to violence by some young women is growing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain how giving a power of arrest on the breach of an undertaking, thus enabling the police to intervene, will somehow load the dice in favour of an attacker who happens to be of a particular gender? It escapes me in both logic and common sense how that could happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have elided the two parts of my speech in an attempt to be brief. I am trying to put it on record that not all violence is against one sex by the other, but that has no bearing on the argument about the power of arrest. I am sorry if I created that illusion.<br><br>
As an undertaking does not involve a finding of violence it is probably premature to attach a power of arrest. If an innocent person makes a promise not to be violent, it does not mean that he has been violent and he should not be arrested thereafter on mere suspicion. I think that that point is worth making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree vehemently with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. If his logic is correct, county court judges should never imprison anyone for breaches of undertakings. Unfortunately, that does happen, so according to the hon. Gentleman, the county courts must have been dishing out anything but justice. With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, I cannot accept what he said either in logic or common sense.<br><br>
I agree with the purport of the amendments. We should remember that the magistrates court remedy is frequently an emergency remedy and it is right and proper that it should be available as such. One of the problems has been that because the power of arrest has been so infrequently used, men often walked away from court laughing because they knew that if they breached an undertaking there would be no likelihood of their being sent down for a repeated occurrence. Clearly that was not good enough. Also, police in the past were less than ready to get involved in what used to be called "domestics". The net effect was that a huge amount of violence went unpunished. Women were subjected to repeated acts of violence against which they had almost no redress. That was not right, and the amendments would simply bring the magistrates courts' jurisdiction into line with what exists in the county court.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
I might have argued differently 20 years ago but just now I see no reason for the distinction between magistrates courts and the county courts. Even in the most rural areas where throughput is low, magistrates are becoming expert in family law. They are trained thoroughly in understanding family law and in how to deal with family cases sensitively. They can see the wood for the trees, so to speak.<br><br>
Bearing in mind the level of expertise in magistrates courts, it is appropriate that these powers should be extended to their jurisdiction. It would be wrong not to do so; after all, we are dealing with remedies for violence, and we should be failing a lot of people if magistrates courts were not given a set of remedies equal to what is available in the county courts.<br><br>
I have no hesitation in supporting both the amendments relating to undertakings which, as hon. Members from both sides of the Committee have said, are not a finding of guilt. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) said that a person giving an undertaking was not necessarily guilty. But there would be no problem for an innocent person, who would not breach the undertaking anyway.<br><br>
When a person gives an undertaking to a court it is not like a conviction or a guilty verdict. We would not know whether an undertaking is based on evidence because there would be no trial of fact, but it is not logical to say that that would be unfair. In any case, that argument, if it applied in this debate, would also apply to the existing and well tried law pertaining to family matters in the county courts.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will be able to support the thrust of these important amendments. In our deliberations so far we have spoken several times about domestic violence: this is an opportunity to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). There is one other important distinction between an undertaking and this order: undertakings do not prejudice any possible subsequent dealings that may take place in custody proceedings. That is important because it means that people can make an undertaking in the knowledge that doing so will not compromise their position at a possible time in the future when, unhappily, they may be involved in a custody battle.<br><br>
Also, I wish to reinforce what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said about not extending a power of arrest. The words "power of arrest" appear several times elsewhere in the Bill. The problem is that a person's lawyer may advise that making an undertaking might prejudice his or her position in many other ways. That runs counter to the aim of taking the matter out of the adverserial arena.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the amendments in the names of my hon. Friends. I am sure that all hon. Members welcome the enormous changes that have taken place, not least in the police's approach to what used to be somewhat disparagingly called a mere "domestic". There is now a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0181">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
genuine appreciation of the inordinate damage that is done in a domestic situation. A place in which women and children should feel safest is far too often the place in which the woman finds herself in greatest danger.<br><br>
There is a long way for society to go, however, in acknowledging that domestic violence is a crime. Violence exercised outside the home on a stranger is considered a crime, and I can see no logic in the argument that violence visited on a spouse in the home is a lesser crime.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) said, the amendments are important because they send a signal to what I believe to be the majority of the women who are victims of domestic violence—although it is difficult to prove a negative—who persist in believing that they are at fault and are guilty. They feel a strong sense of shame and find it almost impossible to report such acts of violence, which are often so serious that the woman has to be taken to the emergency room of the local hospital. Even then, women will not bring charges because they feel that what prompted the violent outburst must in some way be their fault.<br><br>
As part of a process to change the perception of domestic violence, the House—which is this country's lawmaker—would, by attaching the powers of arrest to undertakings, categorically state that domestic violence is so serious a crime that it warrants the power of arrest and the arm of the law, backed by the majesty of this place. We should show that the House wants to defend women, who are invariably vulnerable in such situations. Women are concerned not only about the violence to them, but about the violence that may be visited on their children, so they are doubly vulnerable and often doubly trapped.<br><br>
If the arguments in favour of the amendments do not carry weight simply on the basis of their effects on a woman and her family, I suggest to the Minister that all hon. Members will have met constituents who have complained about violence or noise disturbance being visited on neighbours even when an injunction has been imposed. For example, some men totally ignore an order precluding them from coming within a physically defined distance of their wife or partner. Such men invariably arrive late at night, not unusually—as my hon. Friend the Member for Barking said—suffering from alcohol or drug misuse, and wanting only to harass, cause concern and create fear.<br><br>
In my constituency, which is densely populated, such activities impinge on the neighbours. In one case, a neighbour went to the front door to try to calm the man on whom an order had been placed and himself suffered violence.<br><br>
Although my main concern is for the woman suffering domestic violence, there are wider ramifications for the community and for the woman's immediate family. In one extremely serious case in my constituency, an order was made forbidding my constituent's former partner to come within a certain distance of her and her children, and what had been the family home. She called the police to remove the man; they came, but because there were no powers of arrest
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
they went away. The man returned, broke into the property and inflicted severe physical damage on my constituent and trashed such meagre belongings as there were in the home.<br><br>
The power of arrest can act to prevent the possibility of physical damage from being visited on the woman. There is no waste of police time, something that I am sure all members of the Committee will take seriously. Police are called on such occasions, but because there is no power of arrest all they can do is to issue warnings, and there is no way of preventing a further and more serious criminal act from being committed. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendments. They are important, not only for the protection of women and children but because of the message that they would send out. They would play no small part in preventing serious acts of violence from being meted out to women and their children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. Some contributions have touched on specific amendments and the concerns of Judge Stephen Gerlis that were published in the January edition of <i>Family Law.</i> He was worried that there may be a watering down of undertakings as against applications being made in court for orders with powers of arrest attached. Other contributions to the debate have been more general in relation to domestic violence so I shall respond briefly to those points first.<br><br>
I am aware of the "Blow the Whistle" campaign that has been launched by The Body Shop. I support it. It backs part IV of the Bill and wants the Bill brought into operation as swiftly as possible. That is the core of the campaign. It also argues that the Bill should be amended so that cohabitants' rights and those of spouses are equal under part IV—a matter that we may debate in due course. The Committee well understands why the Government have made certain adjustments in the Bill to reflect concerns in that regard. The main thrust of The Body Shop's campaign supports part IV because it gives protection to people who suffer domestic violence.<br><br>
The attachment of a power of arrest to orders and the beefing up of the law led Judge Stephen Gerlis to express his concern initially that the orders would be used and that the use of undertakings would diminish and be removed from the system. That is the core of my hon. Friend's argument. The amendments would create a duty for the courts to attach a power of arrest to an undertaking in the same circumstances as when the courts are under a duty to attach a power of arrest to an order under clause 44.<br><br>
Clause 43(2) and (3) reflect the current law in preventing a power of arrest from being attached to an undertaking. As the hon. Member for Brent, South said on Second Reading, undertakings are a useful means by which the courts can deal with certain situations in a way that can defuse tensions between the parties. As well as being highlighted by the hon. Gentleman, that point was made by my hon. Friends.<br><br>
However, the creation of a duty to attach a power of arrest to an undertaking is hardly likely to defuse tension or, more importantly, increase the use of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0182">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
undertakings before the court. Indeed, by making undertakings exactly equivalent to orders in such circumstances, the amendments would reduce the court's flexibility in dealing with individual situations. Furthermore, they would not offer an incentive to parties to agree to give undertakings as an alternative to the court's making an order.<br><br>
An additional factor is that the applicant does not have to prove the case for the court to accept an undertaking. Thus, when it accepts an undertaking, the court may not have heard all the evidence and may not be in a position to know whether the duty to attach a power of arrest should apply. Even if the court had heard the evidence, the willingness of the respondant to give an undertaking might be one of the circumstances of the case taken into account by the court; it might satisfy the court that the applicant was adequately protected without the power of arrest being granted. The Committee will recall that that was one of the core factors to be taken into account when making an order.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brent, South referred today and on Second Reading to District Judge Gerlis's article in <i>Family Law.</i> In last month's edition of <i>Family Law,</i> the judge retracted his concern about the Bill's effect on the use of undertakings. That retraction has the headline, "Undertakings redeemed". Judge Gerlis said that since his article appeared he has discussed the matter with other district judges and his worries have been assuaged. He said, "The overall consensus"—[<i>Laughter.</i>] It is fascinating to see how the views of a powerful witness, quoted on Second Reading and during this debate, who then expresses his support for the Bill's provisions—especially of clause 41, which he says restores "faith in undertakings"—are now treated by the hon. Gentleman with derision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman really ought not to assume that our wry laughter is aimed at District Judge Stephen Gerlis. It is aimed at the Minister and at the Government's desperation in the face of the widespread concern expressed by their Bank Benchers on that matter. They seek to counter that by telling the Committee that the judge has recanted after a meeting with his fellow judges. That will not wash. The Minister should be able to marshal a better argument than that against the powerful argument presented by my hon. Friends and by some Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pointing out that the Bill is effective in the matter of making undertakings, as District Judge Gerlis said in his article. It is not a question of a judge being called back to order by his fellow judges. He specifically mentioned his discussions with District Judge Roger Bird, the author of a forthcoming book on the reforms made by the Family Law Bill, who has taken Judge Gerlis through the Bill so that he understands it better. The author of the opinion quoted by the hon. Gentleman now supports the Government's reforms. That, I would argue, is fairly powerful evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That latest exchange confirms for those of us who are not lawyers our innate suspicion of legal advice about almost anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speaking as a lawyer, I maintain that it is good practice for lawyers to keep up to date—not only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
with legislation but with journals, especially when taking the dangerous step of quoting journals published some months ago without knowing what is in the current edition.<br><br>
Amendment No. 79, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, seeks to remove the provision that prevents a court from accepting an undertaking in a case where it would otherwise be appropriate to attach a power of arrest. Undertakings could thus be used in any circumstances, including as an alternative to an order with a power of arrest attached. However, I believe that that widens the scope for the use of undertakings to an unacceptable extent. The power of arrest will be attached only when the court is satisfied that the respondent has used or threatened violence and the applicant or child would not be adequately protected without it. To enable an undertaking to be used even when that test is satisfied could lead to situations when the applicant or child is not adequately protected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister critical of the practice in county courts of the power of arrest being attached to an undertaking?</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I am highlighting the fact that the Bill provides that that must be in circumstances when the parties would not be adequately protected without it. We must make the distinction between the use of undertakings and orders that are made with powers of arrest attached. It is anticipated in the Bill that there will be significantly more power attached to orders. The debate is about the way in which undertakings will dovetail with that procedure and the claim that, somehow, undertakings will be used less. The genesis of those concerns is the article written by Judge Stephen Gerlis, which was quoted at length, but I have told the Committee his current views.<br><br>
Amendment No. 19 specifies that magistrates courts should have the same power as higher courts to accept undertakings. The Government agree with that, but the amendment is unnecessary as the Bill will have that effect. A court is defined in Part IV of the Bill as the High Court, a county court or a magistrates court. Thus clause 43(1) provides all levels of court with the power to accept an undertaking. I am not sure whether the confusion has arisen because of the terms of clause 43(5), which preserves the existing powers of the High Court and county court in relation to undertakings apart from this section. That subsection was included as a precautionary measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apparently it was not just Judge Gerlis who was worried about that; the Solicitors Family Law Association and the Law Society were concerned, too. Has my hon. Friend the Minister had a chance to consult them recently and are they now satisfied like Judge Gerlis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not had any recantations from the Solicitors Family Law Association. The article specifies the way in which Judge Stephen Gerlis anticipates that the undertaking procedure would work. He reached the conclusion that clause 41 will restore some faith in

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
undertakings. I am happy for a copy of the article to be provided to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, as I do not want to detain the Committee by reading it all now. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am hearing recantations from all sides. I understand that representatives of the Solicitors Family Law Association have met my officials and that that organisation is now content.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recant as well then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am inclined to say that I should quit while I am ahead.<br><br>
I hope that I have cleared the confusion and shown that the aim of amendment No. 19 is already achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We remain concerned. Regardless of the recantations we are not satisfied. There does not seem to have been one from the Law Society, which is charged with advising on legislation. It may be that there is now a widespread lack of concern about the matter, but I am not satisfied. I am disappointed that the Minister did not spend a little more time on the issue of power of arrest and the need to bring to bear, on those who make undertakings, the seriousness of such undertakings. Time and again, the experience of the police, those in the social services and those running refuges is that parties to undertakings—all too often men—breach those undertakings and treat them with a lack of respect. Those parties are willing to respect the undertakings at the door of the court, but as soon as they leave the court, they breach them through their conduct towards the women involved.<br><br>
The Committee has spent a great deal of time considering the issue of violence. Whenever we have discussed violence, we have been told—it is a sad song—that although the problem is real, sufficient remedies exist, that there is no need to strengthen them and that the amendments are unnecessary. I am not surprised that that was repeated today. It would be refreshing to hear the Minister and some of his hon. Friends recant their complacency about the state of the existing law. The Minister shakes his head, but the reality is that part IV hardly does more than codify existing law.<br><br>
If there had been a desire to strengthen and broaden the impact of the legal remedy for domestic violence, the Government could have done so in the Bill. However, for whatever reason they have chosen not to do so. Every time that we have moved an amendment on violence, the Government have said, with insufficient reason, that it was unnecessary. If the Minister could give one example of where he has accepted an Opposition amendment, I should be glad to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to read clause 43(4)—I presume that it has come to his attention rather more than the <i>Family Law</i> article to which I referred him—he would see that it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An undertaking given to a court under subsection (1) is enforceable as if it were an order of the court."</p></blockquote>
I would have thought that he would appreciate the fact that that beefs up the provisions on undertakings.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Time and again, we have given the Minister opportunities to strengthen the impact of the Bill on domestic violence, but he has not chosen to take them. We have noted that fact; it reflects the Government's appalling complacency about the matter. The hon. Gentleman may shake his head. The Government had opportunities to do more, but they chose to decline them. What they have done is not good enough and we will press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have now reached clause 58, for which there are starred amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent. In accordance with my earlier ruling, it is inappropriate for me to call those amendments. However, the hon. Member for Mid-Kent may wish to raise the issues with which they deal in our clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0184">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I would like my hon. Friend the Minister's assurance on two elements of the clause. First, there appears to be no definition of "cohabitants", except that they live together as man and wife. It would be ridiculous if considerable financial and property advantages or disadvantages were attached to cohabitants of short standing. It would also be very improper if people who had been cohabitants but had parted after a quarrel and then returned briefly, for whatever reason, were treated as if they were cohabitants under the clause.<br><br>
Secondly, we need to be clear about whom we mean when we talk about people who are living in the same household, because we could get into difficult water. For example, a wife may move in with her parents-in-law and make an allegation against the father-in-law. She may discover that she can acquire the right to expropriate the owner's house. If we are not careful, we will find that we are proudly asserting that an Englishman's home is his hostel. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would address those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am concerned about the clause. Subsection (1)(a) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"'cohabitants' are a man and a woman who, although not married to each other, are living together as husband and wife".</p></blockquote>
There is no reference in the Bill to a time scale. I am concerned that, even if it were a short relationship, the owner—1 am referring to the man in this case—would have an ouster order against him merely because someone felt that possession of his property would be very nice thank you.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Evennett) is also concerned about this matter; he raised it with me during a discussion yesterday. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell the Committee what the minimum duration of such a relationship should be under the definition in subsection (1)(a)? I believe that there should be a minimum, otherwise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent said, if an Englishman has the misfortune to enter into such a relationship, his castle could become a hostel in which he is merely a transient. I appreciate that this is not a vote of confidence in the fairer sex, but this issue should be raised at this stage and I am interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for raising this issue. It relates to the Body Shop's campaign, to which I referred earlier. I support that campaign to ensure that part IV of the Bill contains measures that provide a good deal more protection against domestic violence and to extend that protection to ensure that there is absolute read-across and equality in the position of cohabitants as against spouses. That necessarily draws in many of the points that my hon. Friends made.<br><br>
I would argue that the Bill's current structure addresses their points. First, we must consider whether the cohabitant has existing property rights. The Bill treats people who have existing property rights differently from those who do not. If associated persons—to whom my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
Mid-Kent referred—do not have existing property rights, they are able to apply only for non-molestation orders. Associated persons can obtain occupation orders only where there were certain existing property rights.<br><br>
Where a cohabitant is non-entitled—that is, he or she does not have existing property rights—and applies for an occupation order, the courts will have to take into account all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the parties relationship and the length of time that has elapsed since the parties ceased to live together as husband and wife. The parties conduct towards each other would also be relevant. In addition, when the court considers whether to grant an ouster order, it must take into account any significant harm that has been suffered by the applicant or any relevant child and which is attributable to the respondent's conduct. Such balance of harm questions do not impose a duty on the court to make an ouster order if it is satisfied, which contrasts with the position for spouses and entitled cohabitants.<br><br>
Clause 38 has attracted some attention and I am bound to say that some hon. Members—not least Opposition Members—are opposed to some aspects of it. It provides that the court
<br><blockquote><p>"is to have regard to the fact that the parties have not given each other the commitment involved in marriage."</p></blockquote>
That is to be a consideration when it decides whether—and if so, how—to exercise its power in making occupation orders.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) will gauge from that that the Bill provides for judgment to be exercised by the court according to the circumstances of the case. I appreciate that my hon. Friend has not tabled an amendment on this and is not pressing the issue, but to have a period after which one acquires particular rights as a cohabitant would cause more arguments to be raised about equality of interest than have been raised already. I would prefer such matters to be balanced in the ways that I have outlined to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Lester <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems is that before a case gets to the court, solicitors often explain to clients the situation as they see it. They frequently do that in such a way that the client is frightened by the information that has been given and considers not proceeding to the court.<br><br>
I understand what my hon. Friends the Members for Mid-Kent and for Batley and Spen said, but it is important that the solicitors understand that they are not the court and that the court can give more accurate advice. We have all had cases where a solicitor has told a client what would happen if he or she goes to court and the person has said, "Thank you very much, but I don't think I will go to court on that basis." It is a sensitive area, especially when people have set up odd relationships or where a child is involved but the parents are not married. Such advice can often be detrimental to one or other of the parties. We need to give clearer instructions so that those who give advice give fair advice.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
SHORT TITLE, COMMENCEMENT AND EXTENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 41, leave out lines 20 to 23.<br><br>
Subsection (5) of clause 62 was added to the Bill at the end of its passage through another place. It provides that nothing in the Bill
<br><blockquote><p>"shall impose any charge on the people or on public funds".</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the insertion of such clauses is normal in Bills that emanate from the other place and reflects the fact that such matters of expenditure are the privilege of the House of Commons alone. Accordingly, the subsection now needs to be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the ordinary course of events, it might not be necessary for us to debate this provision because, as the Minister said, it is a traditional debate for the other place. But on this occasion, we want to debate the issue for an obvious reason—we have a duty to inquire about the public expenditure implications of any measure that comes before us. From time to time, we have sought to elicit from the Minister the exact public expenditure implications of the Bill. You, Mr. O'Hara, and Sir Patrick have been most indulgent in that respect. For every subject under consideration, we have raised the proper questions, namely, how much will it cost and how much has been put aside in resource terms to address each and every issue on which the specific aspect of Government policy touches? Time and again, the Minister has refused to give us the information or, indeed, any indication whatever of the public expenditure implications of the measures.<br><br>
It seems right to raise the same questions in relation to clause 62—how much will its provisions cost; where will the money come from; what savings, if any, will be made; and on what basis do the Government continue to maintain that the Bill is cost neutral?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall that the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) raised similar points about cost implications during earlier debates? It was interesting that she failed to receive any adequate answers, either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a completely—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gary Streeter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bogus point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a completely accurate and apposite point. It is interesting to note the pass to which the Conservatives have come. When we raise public expenditure issues in Committee or on the Floor of the House, they are met with derision by Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not at the moment; let me finish the point. There was a time when Conservative Members took public expenditure seriously. That is no longer the case, but perhaps on this issue as on others, there is a degree of variance among Conservative Members.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way to me, then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly a degree of variance if the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle wants to speak. Let us hear what he and the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) have to say. The contributions of the hon. Member for Stockton, South are always welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would welcome knowing whether the hon. Gentleman has cleared his speech with the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown). We all know that anything said here or elsewhere might be subject to subsequent revision either by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East or even, perhaps, by the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Conservatives really are desperate. I need have no concern about the Oppositon' s clear attitude to public expenditure—we are not prepared to accept anything, least of all from Conservative Members, that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been extremely indulgent with the hon. Gentleman, but I must refer him to page 1 of the bill. The words in bold type were inserted by the House of Lords to avoid questions of privilege, as the Minister said. It is inappropriate at this stage to have a wide-ranging debate on public expenditure.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Does that mean that we are not allowed to discuss the spending limit of the hon. Member for Brent, South or the £3 billion that the shadow Treasury team says can be spent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In terms of strict formality, yes. I trust that the hon. Member for Brent, South will proceed in accordance with my ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly do so. Had I not been tempted down this path by the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin), I should not have dreamt of ranging as far and wide as Dunfermline.<br><br>
Bearing in mind your comments, Mr. O'Hara, the removal of the subsection at the Minister's instigation will no doubt proceed apace. The Opposition want figures for the measure's public expenditure implications to be published equally unequivocally. Subject to your indulgence, Mr. O'Hara, we intend to go on and on about that, until our questions are answered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not it clear that, whatever the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, it will not be enough for the Labour party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley). I am tending towards the view that the hon. Member for Brent, South might now be concerned that he will not receive the permission of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East for any expenditure that might be involved in savings marriages.<br><br>

Let me deal now with the points that the hon. Gentleman raised—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not necessary for the Minister to deal with points that the hon. Member for Brent, South made if they were not in accordance with my ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, I shall expect to be called to order by you, Mr. O'Hara as I deal with the hon. Gentleman's specific points and to be told that they are irrelevant in the context of the amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the financial basis of the Bill; I have said throughout that it is cost neutral. Bearing in mind the length of time that the hon. Gentleman was given to make his remarks, I should at least place that fact on the record.</span></p>

POWERS OF CONSTABLE OR AUTHORISED PERSON</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>"— (1) This section applies where an authorised constable or some other authorised person—
<ol>
<li>has reasonable cause to believe that a person (`the aggrieved person') has been subjected to molestation, violence or threatened violence; and</li>
<li>having ascertained so far as practicable the wishes of the aggrieved person considers that it is appropriate for the constable or authorised person to apply for an occupation order or a non-molestation order.</li></ol>

<li>Where this section applies, the authorised constable or some other authorised person may apply to the court on behalf of the aggrieved person for any occupation order or non-molestation order for which the aggrieved person could himself have applied.</li>
<li>Where an application for a non-molestation order or an occupation order is made by virtue of subsection (2)—</li>
<ol>
<li>the court, in determining whether, and if so how, to exercise its powers under sections 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, or 39, shall have regard to any wishes expressed by the aggrieved person (as well as to the other matters to which it is obliged under this Act to have regard), and</li>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
During our previous debate, we considered amendments Nos. 18 to 29 and had cause, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) noted, to reflect on the improvement in the exercise of their criminal jurisdiction in this matter by the police. They are developing the effective and coordinated response that domestic violence requires. A new multi-agency approach to domestic violence is developing throughout the country, involving social services, voluntary organisations and the police as well as court-based services, and it is proving valuable. That does not mean that there is room for complacency—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
effectiveness continues to be patchy. The amendment seeks to build on the excellent examples of that multi-agency response, but the response to other areas is less well covered and not always adequate. Home Office circular 60 of 1990, which has formed the basis of good practice, was an important step forward. The new, more sensitive police response to domestic violence has sometimes been implemented too slowly and what may be called the canteen culture has occasionally continued among some police forces which do not treat domestic violence sufficiently seriously.<br><br>
Some members of the Committee, such as the hon. Member for Batley and Spen and my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate, have paid tribute to local government police initiatives, particularly the zero tolerance campaign, that have made real progress. The amendment seeks to build on that progress. The Law Commission's report, "Domestic Violence and Occupation of the Family Home", recognised the tension that has always existed in this and related fields, such as neighbourhood relationships and disputes, and tension also exists between the civil and criminal jurisdictions. The amendment seeks—and I emphasise that it is on a pilot basis—to enhance police powers so that they can pursue civil remedies in domestic violence cases on behalf of and after consultation with the victims.<br><br>
The amendment builds on a proposal that initially came from the Law Commission—of which my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) was a member—that the police be given that power of family protection universally and immediately. We did not feel able to go that far. We bore in mind the criticism of the Law Commission's proposal contained in the Home Affairs Select Committee's 1993 report on domestic violence. We were aware also of the anxieties expressed by the Association of Chief Police Officers and others about that proposal's resource implications and about the need to ensure that the police were able and sufficiently equipped to play their appropriate role in domestic violence matters.<br><br>
There is good reason to proceed with care with this problem. We must make sure that the infrastructure is in place and that the multi-agency approach has developed sufficiently to warrant the extension of powers envisaged by the Law Commission and proposed again in new clause 1. That is why the new clause makes it clear that the proper approach is that the Lord Chancellor should give his authority before any force—or its constables, or any other authorised person—is able to exercise powers in the civil jurisdiction on behalf of the victim of domestic violence.<br><br>
The first priority of a civil injunction is to secure protection for the victim. The criminal jurisdiction is concerned with apprehending and punishing the offender, but civil injunctions answer several needs. Importantly, they include—through the exclusion of an offender from the home or its vicinity—the exercise of a degree of social control over an offender. They are designed to allow a victim of domestic violence to continue to live in the family home in safety and security. They can also assist in preventing intimidation and retaliatory violence when the person who has been

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
made subject to the jurisdiction attempts to hit back and deter the victim from obtaining the full protection of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear what my hon. Friend has to say about the new clause. The Home Affairs Select Committee was mindful of the way in which the proposal would be implemented and of the representations that we received. I am sure that my hon. Friend's suggestion will be welcomed by police trying to investigate these difficult matters and bring them before the court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who played a very important part in the Home Affairs Select Committee's deliberations on these matters by ensuring that relevant questions were properly explored.<br><br>
All too often, the experience of the police, social service agencies and legal practitioners is that the victim of domestic violence is severely traumatised. The Committee has heard that stated repeatedly in our deliberations about parts II and III of the Bill, as well as in our discussion of part IV. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate said, the victim sometimes blames herself. When an outsider intervenes to take on board some of the burden saying, "I am here not only to stand by you, but"—as envisaged under the new clause—"to stand in for you", that can be a positive advantage as it removes some of the load.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Anyone who has practised in the field or has any experience of working with the victims of domestic violence will know that the proceedings themselves can impose an intolerable burden. Victims may have experienced violence over a weekend and seen their children traumatised.<br><br>
We should not forget the impact of domestic violence on the children who have to witness it. I hope that we shall be able to discuss that not only on Report but later today, when we consider provisions relating to children. It is truly horrendous to be in a room when one's mother—and it usually is the mother—is beaten about the body and kicked from pillar to post by the man who is one's much-loved dad. It is sometimes difficult for us to appreciate the extent of that trauma.<br><br>
I have seen cases in which a woman who has experienced such violence over the weekend has had to go to a solicitor's office on the Monday, give the details that make up the affidavit and then be told to go down the road to another solicitor—a stranger—to swear that affidavit. The woman has to hand over money and she has to do yet further explaining. The additional trauma that that entails can be horrendous.<br><br>
The new clause would enable the Lord Chancellor's Department to work in partnership with the police, the women's refuge movement and local authorities to establish a pilot scheme involving designated police forces or other authorised persons. Domestic violence units already have resources and trained personnel and officers in place. The scheme would show how we could adopt an approach that removes some of the burden.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
The Law Commission recognises that the proposal represents a new and radical departure from existing practice, but we believe that it is important. The time has come to take the step that the new clause envisages. We would move step by step, adopting its provisions when resources are in place and when the will is there and the time is right. Given the scale of the problem of domestic violence and its disastrous impact on relationships and on children, it represents a step that has now become necessary. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support both the new clause and the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South. During previous debates on the appalling subject of domestic violence, we heard that those who suffer such abuse are often reluctant to alert the authorities. I said earlier that many women may feel a sense of shame and personal guilt that some fault of theirs had occasioned the abuse, even though, in far too many instances, the abuse was regular and entirely impossible to link to a genuine cause. Indeed, I would argue that there can be no genuine cause for the sort of violence that is often visited upon women in their homes.<br><br>
In many instances, it is neighbours who first alert the police to what are deemed to be instances of domestic violence. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South said, it would be enormously valuable and a step in the right direction if a third party could share the burden of the abused—almost invariably a woman. My hon. Friend said that, having endured a weekend of violence, a woman might have to go to more than one office to set the legal wheels in motion. I know from constituency cases that such women feel deeply ashamed at having to present themselves in public with bruised faces that show the physical and external evidence of the weekend—noticed, they imagine, by everyone they pass on the street. That has always seemed to me to be a fine turning of the screw. I am sure that all hon. Members find that situation unacceptable and believe that we should attempt to change it.<br><br>
Another factor is the effect of violence on children who see their mothers being regularly abused. That is the essence of our debate. We are not talking about isolated instances of violence—a sudden, inexplicable and never-to-be-repeated loss of temper. We are talking about consistent, regular abuse by the father upon the mother. It is as though abuse is part and parcel of the marriage contract—that it is the husband's right to inflict violence, and the wife's duty to take it without complaint.<br><br>
I cannot argue that my next point is supported by a wealth of scientific, social or educational evidence, but we are seeing a marked increase in violence in our schools. The majority of teachers are women. One body of opinion states that because so many boys see their mothers being beaten, abused and, in many instances, treated with contempt by their fathers, they believe that it is normal—that that is how all women should be treated. Many boys therefore have little or no respect for women in positions of authority, as school teachers.<br><br>
There is a wider concern, which is why I welcome the new clause and why I hope it will be accepted. We have been talking about specific, individual cases of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0188">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
violence, but there are wider implications for society as a whole. We are undoubtedly witnessing a serious breakdown in the country's social fabric. The use of violence as a port of first resort and the use of increasing use of violence by young children—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was indulgent during the hon. Lady's opening remarks because she clearly felt strongly about the matters to which she was referring. However, she is now moving into a wider debate, going from domestic violence to violence in society. I should be grateful if she would focus her comments on the precise subject of the debate, which is the proposal to extend the powers of constables and others in relation to certain orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. I am about to conclude my remarks. A most valuable aspect of the new clause is that it would almost immediately offer some support to the woman who, within her own home, feels that she is isolated on a distant, dead planet without recourse to any help. I hope that the Government will look favourably on the new clause, which it would do much to reduce the glib acceptance of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South. I do not want to reiterate what has already been said about domestic violence, but many members of the Committee are lawyers and that is slightly inhibiting to those of us who are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Lady was married to a lawyer. Is she confessing that something is amiss at home?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just because I am married to a lawyer, that does not necessarily mean that I have the same information, skill and education as him. It is the one area in which I bow to my husband, as I expect him to bow to me in other areas.<br><br>
What is slightly inhibiting about the debate is that it is tied to the law. Domestic violence is a hideous crime, so it is odd that we are reluctant to involve the police. Why is that? If it is something that we all abhor, why cannot we set up a pilot scheme, along the lines of the new clause, under which the police could assist vulnerable women trying to prevent themselves from being hit and abused in their homes? That is my common-sense approach to the matter.<br><br>
I gather that the argument is about whether it is the civil or criminal justice system that should be involved. I do not understand that. If the civil justice system is about protecting victims, but we cannot use the police to help to protect them, there is something a little odd about the whole justice system. Police should be able to play a role in the protection of victims as well as in the pursuance of offenders. Obviously, we need them to pursue offenders, but surely they should also assist in the protection of victims. Please let us try that. If it helps even a few women and prevents them from living with the horrors of domestic violence, it will be a good thing.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate referred to children. As we know, litigation in the pursuance of ending a marriage can be destructive to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
children. When the woman has to take the initiative in action against domestic violence, that is even more damaging to children. Let us think about that. Where there is domestic violence, the woman feels completely downtrodden, demoralised and vulnerable. It is a matter of power between the two partners and the man is more powerful than the woman. There is no doubt that the children will be used as a weapon in the dispute between the two partners. The woman will want to protect not only herself but her children. If the man in the relationship attempts to bring the children into the dispute, it puts another obstacle in the woman's way when she is trying to gain proper protection for herself and her children. If a third party—the police—is involved, that additional danger and distress could be avoided.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I understand that one of the problems in the past of involving the police in actions on domestic violence in the civil system has been that the police believe that they are under-resourced. Throughout our deliberations, we have talked about new resources for conciliation, mediation and information. We have extended the time before a divorce can be completed. I am married to a very able lawyer and I am sure that the Minister will agree that there will probably be more litigation and, therefore, greater demands on the legal aid budget.<br><br>
If extra resources are needed for legal aid, conciliation and mediation, why cannot we put a little extra money into ensuring that there is sufficient capacity and training in the police service to assist in cases of domestic violence, which is a most heinous crime? If the police were properly resourced, they would not object to having a role in that. Ironically, the police have over time become much more involved in domestic matters, whether it is family protection or neighbour disputes on council estates.<br><br>
I do not want to say any more, but I genuinely hope that the Minister and his hon. Friends will think about the matter, which is after all a pilot scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that Conservative Members have been thinking about police resources, but we cannot discuss it because that would not be in order. We are discussing the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Chair will rule what is in order. After my former ruling, I have been listening extremely carefully to the remarks of the hon. Member for Barking. While she has strayed towards the boundaries of order, she has not yet gone beyond them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I have strayed a little, Mr. O'Hara. I listened carefully to the ruling you gave my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate, and I was hoping that I had stayed in order.<br><br>
I was urging Conservative Members to support the new clause to show people in the community that we unanimously recognise the hideousness and vileness of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been some helpful contributions to our debate and I thank the hon. Member

for Brent, South for introducing it. It was about the most cautious speech that I have heard from him—I do not mean that in a negative sense. He suggested that the approach would have to be cautious and that it would have to proceed on the basis of a pilot study. That sets the context of the proposal. It is not a resource question; it is an issue that, since the recommendations of the Law Commission, has been considered at some length both by the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Special Public Bill Committee that examined the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill in the other place at the end of last year. The proposal has been the subject of detailed inquiry.<br><br>
I said that the genesis of the idea was the recommendation in the Law Commission's report "Domestic Violence and Occupation of the Family Home". The proposal differs from the commission's recommendation in certain respects—especially as it gives a power to pursue civil remedies on behalf of victims of domestic violence not only to the police but to a category of authorised persons to be appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The Law Commission's proposal was more restricted in that respect. As I have said, the Select Committee on Home Affairs considered that matter in its 1993 report on domestic violence, as did the Special Public Committee in the other place, and both Committees concluded that they did not support the police having such powers.<br><br>
I should set out the context of the decision-making process because, in 1993, it was made clear to the Home Affairs Committee on behalf of the Lord Chancellor that he had not reached a conclusion on the Law Commission's proposal and that he would value the Select Committee's observations. In paragraphs 115 to 118 of its report, the Select Committee dealt in detail with the arguments. As the hon. Member for Barking said, the police thought that there were ways in which the power could be exercised, but they expressed concern about resource implications. However, wider concerns were expressed about the proposal than that.<br><br>
Paragraph 116 of the Select Committee report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Women's groups and others were concerned that, if the police had these powers, they might choose civil remedies rather than criminal charges."</p></blockquote>
That deals with the point made by the hon. Member for Barking, who said that we should involve the police and not just restrict their interest to the criminal sphere. In evidence to the Select Committee, some women's groups expressed concern that the importance of domestic violence would be diminished if the police were to exercise the powers in that way.<br><br>
Paragraph 116 also states a concern that the police
<br><blockquote><p>"might attempt to take decisions themselves rather than leaving them for the victims."</p></blockquote>
As I have practised law, I well understand the sort of scenario to which the hon. Members for Hampstead and Highgate and for Barking referred—about the fears of women who are subjected to domestic violence. However, an issue of empowerment is raised, which involves ensuring that victims can make decisions about such matters.<br><br>
Paragraph 116 continues:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Views along those lines were expressed by the Women's Aid Federation, Welsh Women's Aid, Southall Black Sisters, Victim Support, Nottinghamshire Inter Agency Domestic Violence Forum and the Domestic Violence Intervention Project."</p></blockquote>
So concerns about empowerment go far wider than resource matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a predictable point. Would he like to consider the evidence to the Home Affairs Committee of the Women's Aid Federation? The federation stated that it favoured a pilot scheme along the lines that we have proposed. Paragraph 117 of the report from which the Minister selectively quotes refers to one of the principal advantages that the federation saw in such a scheme. Paragraph 117 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the woman would be relieved of the burden of applying to court herself'.</p></blockquote>
That was the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Barking and for Hampstead and Highgate, and the Minister has yet to answer it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My answer is that we can all be accused of quoting selectively. The hon. Gentleman did not mention the fact that the rest of the paragraph stated that Welsh Women's Aid gave its view and that Southall Black Sisters saw no merit in the proposals. So the views on the pilot project to which the hon. Gentleman referred were not unanimous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat concerned that the Minister presented the evidence that was presented to the Select Committee as though the opinions that were expressed by the organisations that he listed covered every woman in this country—I think that he used the word "unanimity". A fair proportion of the crucial evidence was, however, not heard by those organisations because the women who suffer most do not speak about their suffering outside their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quoted several organisations that had expressed concerns. It is rather trite to dismiss the fact that those concerns were expressed when it demonstrates that the Government have paid some attention to the matter. Paragraph 118 makes it clear that the Lord Chancellor had not made up his mind about the proposals when the Home Affairs Select Committee considered them. The Committee did not conclude that there should be a pilot project, even though it refers to one in its evidence. It concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the Government reject the Law Commission's proposals to give the police third party rights in civil domestic violence actions."</p></blockquote>
That was the Committee's recommendation. Some people might say that the Home Affairs Committee is Tory-dominated—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who, apart from the Minister, has said that? That is an absurd remark, not least when a member of that Committee is sitting nearby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman invests such confidence in the conclusion of the Home Affairs Committee, because the Lord Chancellor agrees with it. Indeed, when the Committee reached its conclusion on 22 February 1993, there was an Opposition majority. It is clear that the Committee took
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0190">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
a unanimous view on the basis of the evidence that was presented to it. I have generously told the hon. Gentleman—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I take it that the hon. Gentleman withdraws that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see, In my case, I have endeavoured to be generous to the hon. Gentleman because I hope that he had introduced the proposals so that we could have a serious debate about its genesis and implications in practice. His behaviour now forces me to question whether that was really his attention.<br><br>
The Home Affairs Committee examined the matter in detail, but concluded that there should not be a pilot project. That was not, however, the end of the story. The proposals in the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill 1995 were considered by a Special Standing Committee in the other place, which reached a similar conclusion to the Home Affairs Committee. That information has fundamentally informed the Government's approach to the matter. We do not, therefore, consider it appropriate to accept the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am driven to the conclusion that the Government will reject every proposal to strengthen the Bill and the protection that it affords to the victims of domestic violence. The Government's actions beggar belief because they are posted on the notion that any reason not to do something should be decisive in our deliberations.<br><br>
It is not good enough for the Minister to point to the third report of the Home Affairs Committee on domestic violence. The Law Commission proposals that the Committee considered did not recommend a pilot scheme along the current lines. The Commission apparently had not considered the involvement of parties other than the police. The current proposal, however, does so. The amendment has the added advantage of enabling the Lord Chancellor's Department—which the Minister said had had an open mind on the matter before apparently closing it in the aftermath of the deliberations to which he referred—to keep the matter under constant review. It also gives the benefit of statute in cases where the Lord Chancellor's Department is satisfied that an adequate infrastructure for taking required action exists.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Once again, the Minister has declined to improve the Bill by including a measure that is modest in intention and scope and which would enable future action. We are not satisfied with the Government's response. They maintain that the beginnings of an infrastructure that would benefit from such powers do not exist; however, the experience on the ground is that child protection and domestic violence units throughout the country are building a body of expertise in and experience of successful co-operation between social services, voluntary organisations, court-based welfare services and the police. Why can we not build on that developing good practice?<br><br>
This has, in some ways, been the most frustrating Committee on which I have ever served. [<i>Interruption.</i>]
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
I hear a sigh of affirmation from the Government Whip. Although this is not the time for valedictory utterances—I hope that that time will come this afternoon—he may well sigh because the Bill has also presented problems to him. The overwhelming frustration for us is that our proposals are dismissed out of hand unless they have received a degree of assent from one or two Conservative Members. Whatever the arguments or the ideas behind them, they have had it unless we can marshal the votes. That is why we look forward to the time when we will be able to marshal the votes and to enact such measures. I make it clear to Conservative Members and their advisers that the Labour party intends to move rapidly on the issue of domestic violence. We may not be able to marshal the votes now, but there will soon come a time when we will be able to do so, in support of those who are determined to protect the home from violence. The Government have done nothing to further that cause in this Committee. We intend to push the new clause to a vote.</span></p>

<ol>
<li>Such regulations shall make provision for the special children's officer to make appropriate arrangements on behalf of children whose parents have—</li>
<ol>
<li>made a statement of marital breakdown under this Act, or</li>
<li>have taken or are taking proceedings under Part II of the Children Act.</li></ol>
<li>Arrangements under subsection (2) shall include the provision of information, advice or assistance, including applying to the court for the separate representation of the child.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 156, in schedule 8, page 72, leave out lines 17 to 28 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In considering whether the circumstances are as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), the court shall have particular regard, on the evidence before it, to the general principles that:
<ol>
<li>the ascertainable wishes and feelings of each child must be considered by those with parental responsibility in the light of the child's age and understanding;</li>
<li>the arrangements proposed must take account of the financial, educational, social, spiritual, emotional and physical implications for each child;</li>
<li>the proposed arrangements do not constitute any risk to each child involved; and</li>
<li>in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the welfare of the child will be best served by his having regular contact with those who have parental responsibility for him, his siblings, grandparents and others of importance to the child.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 153, in schedule 8, page 72, line 28, after "live.", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) the general principles that:—
<ol>
<li>the ascertainable wishes and feelings of each child must be considered by those with parental responsibility in the light of the child's age and understanding;</li>
<li>the arrangements proposed must take account of the financial, educational, social, spiritual, emotional and physical implications for each child;</li>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am indebted to the NSPCC for its hard work, for highlighting the necessity for the new clause and for initiating a thorough debate on the subject. I must make it clear from the outset that the new clause is also supported by the Solicitors Family Law Association, at least in principle. It believes that it would be appropriate for an officer to link in with the care centres, children's centres and family hearing centres that already exist. However, I would go further than that. The officer should also be responsible for liaising with county court centres where matters will be decided by judicial process. Venues where information meetings and mediation are conducted are also relevant.<br><br>
The wording of the new clause is straightforward. It would empower the Lord Chancellor to establish a system of special children's officers who will act as references and co-ordination points for parents and children who require further information, consultation and, if necessary, representation. I have already mentioned liaising with county courts. It has to be said that their processes are often bewildering for lay people, especially at highly emotionally charged times. Children and the parties to the marriage are frequently
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
very upset. The Minister is sympathetic to children's causes and I respectively remind him that he, too, is a council member of the NSPCC in Wales. His hard work and good sense has effectively initiated this short debate.<br><br>
I accept that there are resource implications, but they cannot detract from the good sense, purport and urgent need for children's officers. County courts are rapidly disappearing through being closed or joined with others. Group courts are the theme these days. One officer could service a group of county courts in rotation. Also, I am afraid that by the time the Woolf report is implemented there will be many fewer county courts. Therefore, no resource implication of this new clause will be so great as to make the proposal ridiculous.<br><br>
At present, most parents who divorce wish to act for the benefit of their children. However, many are either unsure about how best to help or serve their children or they are suffering too much stress and emotional turmoil to be able to think clearly and succinctly about their children's needs and welfare. The rather stark result of a 1980 study—"Surviving the Break-up", by Wallerstein and Kelly—was that most children are not consulted at all about such things as contact arrangements. I do not think that matters have improved since then.<br><br>
Children also feel guilt in such circumstances, as the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate noted, even though they are the most innocent parties. They have difficulty expressing their feelings yet clearly perceive that their parents have conflicting needs. I am sure that the Minister does not need me to give him details of the reports establishing what seems to me to be commonsense knowledge.<br><br>
There is also the "nobody listens to me" syndrome experienced by children who have to go through the trauma of their parents' divorce and separation. Very often, children who love both parents equally will discover that living with one means that they will not see the other so often. That is very traumatic for any child.<br><br>
The present divorce system lacks a clearly identifiable source of services for children such as information, consultation and, if necessary, representation. This Bill offers an important opportunity to establish a co-ordinated children's support service. Debates in the other place highlighted the need for the Bill to do more to serve children's interests. I am sure that the Minister has read those debates minutely and that during discussions with his noble Friend the Lord Chancellor he has taken on board the feelings expressed in them. However, the feelings in this House about children's rights, privileges and welfare are just as strong.<br><br>
The new clause proposes that the children's officer would provide information to children and parents about the status of children in the context of divorce. The officer would be able to explain the bewildering process of divorce and the likely outcome of a divorce action. The officer could also act as an advocate for children and young people, whose all-important voices are often drowned in the clamour of warring parties. The officer could also respond to requests for help from children and young people who are experiencing

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
particular problems with their parents' divorce and who may not be heard by their parents.<br><br>
Another important role for the children's officer would be to liaise with family court welfare services, guardians ad litem, child protection services, mediation services, children's panel solicitors and so on. It is suggested—again, I refer to the work that the NSPCC has done in this regard—that the officer would draw on all the existing skills and experience of the court welfare services and of the guardians ad litem already working in the field.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Earlier this week I referred to the large number of panel solicitors who are now well versed in family law, guardianship and the functions of guardians ad litem. Thus, we are not without that role. To a large degree the officer will draw on services that already exist and point people in the right direction. He will ensure that that bewildering process is explained comfortably, easily and on request.<br><br>
With regard to resource implications, it is suggested that the officer's appointment could be financed through an additional filing fee, payable on the filing of the statement of arrangements or divorce proceedings. I see nothing wrong in that. In any event, I do not think that it would be a huge commitment. As I said, the officer would liaise between all the existing services and would more than likely serve a group of county courts, anyway.<br><br>
The officer would also render a substantial preventive element by resolving problems at an early stage. The post is therefore likely to be cost effective because it could avoid the need for expensive and lengthy disputed hearings over the children. I see no reason why the service should not be administered under the umbrella of the Lord Chancellor's Department, which is attached to the 54 or so court centres that already exist.<br><br>
I sincerely believe that the Bill must respond to a crying need. I repeat that it is a vehicle for change. It is our duty to ensure that children's welfare is made the paramount consideration—no one in the Committee, in the House or outside would disagree with that. My small and simple amendment would, in my view, bring that all-important principle to the fore. More importantly, it would provide easy access to information, assistance, representation and a form of counselling, if that were necessary.<br><br>
Finally, the children for whom the Childline project was set up some years ago—young children who were having various difficulties—are the kinds of children who, in the event of their parents divorcing, would not have an outlet for their feelings or a friendly person to turn to, who was experienced in the field. The project has shown that there is an immense need throughout the United Kingdom for such services, but in the field of family law, there is a huge and crying need—and I use the word "crying" advisedly. I urge the Minister to consider the good sense of new clause 2 and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind members of the Committee that we are also discussing new clause 5 and amendments Nos. 156 and 153.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I want to speak to amendment No. 156 at a later stage. Will it be in order for me to do so then rather than now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may refer to amendment No. 156 later in this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy added a great deal to the Committee's deliberations. Although no other members of his party are here, I hope that that fact will go back to those who took part in his election, whether or not they voted for him. He has done what a Member of Parliament should do—brought knowledge, experience and interest to our debates.<br><br>
New clause 5 mentions the possibility of applying
<br><blockquote><p>"for the separate representation of the child."</p></blockquote>
Although earlier amendments were not accepted, that aspect of the new clause could have something going for it. It is important to try to make advice available where relevant when children are around. I shall not press my amendments but now is the time to discuss the importance of trying to maintain relationships and contact between a child and both its parents.<br><br>
Whether the new clauses and the amendments are accepted is one issue; but between now and Report can my hon. Friend the Minister examine whether some of the sensible aims suggested in different ways by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), by me and, perhaps, by others could be taken into account? We do not spend enough time trying to ensure that relationships between a child and its parents are maintained. The point about contact orders is worth considering and I hope that by the time the Bill reports it will contain a measure to reflect what we are trying to achieve, namely, that damage to children be as small as possible and that the positive aspects of their relationships with their parents be as great as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to follow the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy down every path that he took. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham, I believe that the hon. Gentleman spoke with such eloquence and so comprehensively that it is completely unnecessary for me to do so.<br><br>
I want briefly to discuss the difference between amendment Nos. 153 and 156 and then say a few words about the new clauses. The difference between the amendments, both taken from original drafting by the children's consortium led by the NSPCC—the hon. Gentleman's amendment follows it exactly—is that amendment No. 156 would delete lines 20 to 28 of the relevant part of schedule 8 on page 72. In schedule 8, new subsection (2A) contains three paragraphs—(a), (b) and (c)—which were included as the result of a very good debate in another place initiated by the noble Baroness Elles.<br><br>
I shall cover the paragraphs in reverse order. The original wording of new subsection (2A)(c), refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"any risk to the child attributable to—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
<ol>
<li>where the person with whom the child will reside is living or proposes to live; or</li>
<li>any person with whom that person is living or with whom he proposes to live."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 156 also refers to the possibility of a child being at risk, but is less specific. I urge the Committee to agree that it would be better to keep the original, tighter wording.<br><br>
I do not want to follow too far the route of our earlier debate about the relative merits of existing and new fathers. In debate after debate, we have discussed the problems and actuality of violence from and other difficulties with the existing father in the household. Only in new subsection (2A) is the court specifically invited to adderss the possibility of violence or abuse from a new partner, although I understand that a new partner is in the offing in almost 50 per cent. of cases. I want to retain the more specific wording of the existing Bill rather than going for the looser wording.<br><br>
New subsection (2A)(b) concerns:
<br><blockquote><p>"the general principle that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the welfare of the child will be best served by his having regular contact with those who have parental responsibility for him".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 156 extends that provision with a few extra words, stressing the importance of grandparents and siblings. I think that that is a step forward and is absolutely right. I commend that.<br><br>
New subsection (2A)(a), concerns:
<br><blockquote><p>"the conduct of the parties in relation to the upbringing of the child".</p></blockquote>
I must confess to having some difficulty in understanding a complicated and difficult area of the law. I hope that it is in order, Mr. O'Hara, to give a short historical background to the genesis of these words in the other place. A number of us felt strongly that in child custody proceedings it is important that the conduct of the parents be taken into account. I understand that the Clerks in the other place advised that it was not in order to table an amendment to the Children Act 1989 to deal with that point, so instead an amendment was tabled by Baroness Elles to deal with it under schedule 2, which gives a check list that the court has to consider immediately before the divorce.<br><br>
Legal advice from various sources and, I understand, the children's consortium, which promoted the amendments, suggests that the effect of this measure could backfire because the court might be entitled wholly to ignore the conduct of the parents in settling child custody. This measure could be used as a stick to beat the father—it is usually the father—over the head on the matter of having contact with the children.<br><br>
I have to put my hand up and confess that there is much conflicting legal advice in this area. I ask the Minister to reflect on it and to draw on his enormous personal expertise from many years of practice in this area of the law when deciding what impact that conduct will have under the Bill as it is now drafted. Is there some mechanism in the Bill to deal with the arguments that were voiced in the other place about taking into account the conduct of the parents towards the children when deciding child custody?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend is arguing that we should consider what benefit it would be to the child if conduct were taken into account when deciding custody. It should not be a question of a penalty; we should consider what is in the child's best interest for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but many of us believe that at least the conduct of the parents—some of us would argue that it should go wider—towards the child is important to its future welfare. Conduct refers not only to violent abuse but to wider considerations, such as temporary desertion. At the moment, the courts do not always take such conduct into account.<br><br>
Let us reconsider, as the children's consortium has suggested, how new subsection (2A)(a) would work and whether the conduct of parents towards the child can be taken into account in the agreement on custody when there is a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's sincerity, but surely the main issue that the courts examine when they consider custody is the conduct of a parent towards a child. One could argue that that is the only reference point to begin with; it is bound to be. It may be just a matter of semantics, but I think that the hon. Gentleman's proposition is too obvious, as it is already part of current practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has many years of experience of practising law in this area, whereas I simply work as a constituency Member of Parliament and have experience of specific cases that are brought to light in my constituency surgery. The system works better in Canterbury than in many other areas, because it has a particularly good court welfare service—but even in Canterbury I have heard the same story on a number of occasions and the probation service is also concerned. Fathers have come to me and have produced evidence to show that the court has decided that it is in the child's best interest that he or she should be with the mother. I can give two examples, one involving an agricultural worker and the other a policeman. The mother deserted the children for months and went off with a new boyfriend. When the money ran out, the mother realised that the way to get access to the family home was to claim custody of the children. Those mothers were able to return and get custody of the children. In one of those cases the children ran away from the mother several times and tried to go back to the father.<br><br>
I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the conduct of parents is not always fully taken into account. Some judges are inclined to take the view that children are always better with the mother, irrespective of the conduct of the parents towards the children. That is why I want some legal mechanism—</span></p>
