THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING PARTS II AND III</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [30 April</i>]: No. 30, in page 1, line 22, at the end, to add the words—
<br><blockquote><p>'(iv) with due regard to the need to avoid the risk of violence being directed at either or both parties or any children affected'.—[<i>Mr. Boateng.,</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed</i>, That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since I embarked on my contribution to the debate on amendment No. 30, I seem to have lost my voice. I shall, therefore, keep my contribution short this morning.<br><br>
In our previous sitting, I referred to mediation. The National Association of Family Mediation and Conciliation Services recognises that legitimate concerns about power imbalances between divorcing couples must be taken into account in mediation. That is even more important when there is a history of domestic violence, when, at the outset, it should be known that mediation is hardly the course that should be taken.<br><br>
Indeed, in a recent edition of "Mediation Quarterly", Joan Kelly, an authority on the subject, used the following definition of power:
<br><blockquote><p>"Within the mediation context, power can be defined as the ability of a person in a relationship to influence or modify an outcome. Power is the measure of the degree to which one can get one's needs or goals satisfied."</p></blockquote>
The operation of power between a couple is always highly complex. Put simply, however, I believe that it has two broad dimensions, the more important of which is the specifics of the divorce. By that, I mean the reasons why divorce is being sought; the level of anger and resentment that either spouse brings; and the decisions that must be made concerning children, the family home, finances, and so on.<br><br>
It is important that the mediator redresses the power imbalance. When there are signs of intimidation, threats and non-negotiable demands, the mediator should interrupt, challenge and deal with such threatening behaviour. I am talking about typical cases when women are in fear of their husbands. The awareness and skills that mediators bring to bear on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
power imbalances will be of great significance to women because, in the main, such imbalances concern male against female.<br><br>
I have received representations from Welsh Women's Aid about the contribution of the Lord Chancellor in another place. He said that domestic violence would be one of the "prescribed circumstances" in which the Legal Aid Board would not consider mediation more appropriate than proceedings. That is right and proper, and we should build on that statement during our proceedings. We should be wary of anything that places women in a less fortunate position. We are seeking parity in such circumstances. It is difficult when there is a dominant partner and a history of violence, and we should be ever mindful of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have argued strongly for the retention of fault in our divorce laws as a matter of justice. It is my contention that the law should recognise the fault of intolerable behaviour, which, of course, includes domestic violence. It is no good telling a wife who has been beaten by her husband that it is simply a matter of six of one, half a dozen of the other, and that, in some way, she is to blame for her husband's violence.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) accepted some of that argument. During the debate on clause 5 on the Floor of the House, he argued that the law should reflect reality. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Part of that reality is that there is culpability in the breakdown of marriage. It is no use pretending that, when a relationship breaks down, one can divorce that from fault."—[<i>Official Report</i>, 24 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 483.]</p></blockquote>
I know that all members of the Committee—I need not labour the point, as it has been made many times—share a horror of domestic violence and want the law to deal with it firmly. I remind the Committee that the successful amendment that I tabled, extending this period of reflection and consideration to 18 months, had a special proviso that, where there was serious domestic violence, the period should be shortened to one year. However, my amendment will ensure that the court must make it clear that, if necessary, it will take into account the problem of violence.<br><br>
My problem with our debate on amendment No. 30 is that our clear concern about domestic violence needs to be balanced with drawing the court's attention to the possibility of false allegations being made—that is what I want to address my remarks to, as it is a point which has not yet been made.<br><br>
The scandal of the false allegations of child abuse in Cleveland and Orkney showed us what can happen when things get out of balance. Rather than being protected, children have been damaged by being snatched away from their parents in dawn raids.<br><br>
It is my concern—we shall discuss the matter during the proceedings—that the court powers under part IV of the Bill could be abused.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The removal of fault is exactly why there will be less of such behaviour and less invention of allegations. When one person makes an allegation, the other feels bound to make a similar or worse accusation. Children were inevitably placed in the middle, and were being torn apart by their parents. I fully accept the hon. Gentleman's reasoning and sincerity, but I believe that he is utterly wrong on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman will also be aware, and become increasingly aware, that is why the House agreed with him and decided to remove fault from divorce proceedings. The hon. Gentleman will also be aware, and become increasingly aware, that, despite the removal of fault, because of the draconian powers under part IV, allegations—of violence will, unfortunately, remain part of the divorce process. I want to highlight that, as other members of the Committee have not made that important point.<br><br>
I want to make it absolutely clear that I am on a par with the Committee in abhorring violence and in wishing to deal with it severely. However, we need to be as concerned with truth as we are with violence.<br><br>
Dr. Stephen Cretney, Fellow of All Souls college, Oxford, and a former law commissioner, has drawn attention to the problems of occupation orders in part IV of the Bill, which I mentioned in my reply to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). He has drawn particular attention to the balance of harm test. In the Joseph Jackson memorial lecture on 26 January this year, he said that, in his experience,
<br><blockquote><p>"many people react with incredulity when told that there is no need in these cases for any allegation of violence to be made (much less proved)… the Family Law Bar Association drew attention to the risk that change in the law could lead to ouster orders being granted almost on demand—one may wonder how far the decision to legislate as is now proposed really reflects the reality of the ordinary person's sense of what the law should be doing."</p></blockquote>
That quotation is from the "Practitioner" section of the <i>New Law Journal</i> of 26 January 1996.<br><br>
The principal of St. Anne's College, Oxford, Ruth Deech, who has been quoted several times during debates on the Floor of the House, has also written about similar problems. In <i>The Times</i> of 22 March 1996, she wrote about the period for reflection and consideration:
<br><blockquote><p>"The start of the year will also provide an opportunity for (usually) the wife to seek an order to oust her husband from the home, a move which is tactically advantageous under our ancillary relief principles and will be facilitated by the domestic violence provisions of the Family Law Bill. An ouster order will effectively scotch the prospectus for reconciliation or second thoughts."</p></blockquote>
Her analysis is interesting and I agree with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman would concede that the opportunity for a spouse to apply to the courts for an ouster injunction is not new; it has been available in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
law for a considerable time. All that the Bill does is codify the legislation, so that it is in one place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Lady has made that point. It is part of my case—and of the case of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)—that the present law is defective. We do not accept that it is good enough simply to codify the present law; we feel that the present law has been abused and we must use the opportunity presented by the Bill to try to improve it.<br><br>
This is a sensitive debate and I realise that it is easy to convey the wrong impression. My hon. Friend and I are as concerned about violence as any member of the Committee. We recognise that it is a severe problem which needs to be dealt with.<br><br>
But we are also concerned that the legal process may distort the truth about violence in order to achieve the object of one party to a divorce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the current law is being abused. Would he tell the Committee by whom it is being abused?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, I will not deal in specific cases, but it is well known to those who advise me and my hon. Friend—those who practise in the law courts—that the law is being abused by parties who seek an ouster order. It is usually abused in order to gain an ouster order against a husband who is said to have committed violence against a wife, when there is no evidence that such violence has taken place. Often, violence takes place—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Lady may not like what I am saying, but it is important that a member of the Committee says it, because otherwise our debate will be totally imbalanced. It is important that these points are made and that we have this debate early in our proceedings, so that we understand that just as there are two sides to every divorce, there are two sides to this debate. Many people have not hitherto felt represented in our debates and want that point to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. I have been following his argument closely. As I am sure he is aware, at present, if a woman goes to the courts for an ex parte ouster injunction to exclude her husband from the matrimonial home because of violence, she has to attend to present evidence and affidavit evidence has to be provided. In many cases, courts are increasingly strict about ex parte injunctions, and the application is contested. When I was at the Bar, I frequently dealt with such cases, in which evidence is examined.<br><br>
I am somewhat perplexed about why the hon. Gentleman is presenting a picture of an instant procedure for obtaining an ouster order. In my discussions with police forces in London and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
elsewhere, no evidence was presented to substantiate the hon. Gentleman's claim.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Lady has made that point, because, particularly when we come to discuss part IV of the Bill, we want to make it absolutely clear that the law fulfils what the hon. Lady hopes that it will: that where there is domestic violence, there is an ouster order. Where the wife—I accept that it is usually the wife—is under threat, it is clearly right that the husband be removed from the marital home.<br><br>
We also want it to be absolutely clear in the Bill that there must be clear evidence of violence, not merely evidence of a threat of violence.<br><br>
A threat of violence might be so great that it must result in an ouster order, but we want a serious debate about that to ensure that people—usually men—do not feel that they are victims of an unfair legal process. That is why it is important to have this debate.<br><br>
I am unable to support this well-intentioned amendment because there is a lack of balance in it. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Brent, South about one matter in part IV. On Second Reading, he drew attention to the way in which the Bill represents a disincentive to the use of undertakings. He said that such undertakings have a valuable role in discouraging domestic violence. He quoted Judge Stephen Gerlis, who said that undertakings
<br><blockquote><p>"'have clear advantages—they reduce confrontation, they avoid the need for full, often lengthy hearings and findings of fact, there are no winners and loosers thus mitigating feelings of resentment. Because of these effects, they are breached somewhat less than injunctions. To put it plainly—they are popular and they work'."—[<i>Official Report</i>, 25 March 1996; Vol. 274, c. 756.]</p></blockquote>
I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. He may know that I tabled amendment No. 79, which would permit the court to accept an undertaking without a power of arrest being attached, as will be required under the Bill.<br><br>
It is my contention that we cannot be concerned about safety without being concerned about justice and truth. My reservations about part IV and the possible abuse of various court orders are shared by some eminent legal authorities. I shall quote another authority who has concerns about injustice. In the January 1996 edition of <i>Family Law</i>, Judge Gerlis—the expert whom the hon. Member for Brent, South quoted—drew attention to the fact that the Lord Chancellor might well require applications for non-molestation orders to be directed solely to magistrates courts. That would create the problem that no details of the evidence on which an ex parte injunction was based would be served on the respondent. The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) might be interested in that. On page 52 of that edition of <i>Family Law</i>, Judge Gerlis wrote:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"There are extremely powerful arguments in favour of the respondent having his say in response to an application and order made in his absence."</p></blockquote>
So there is another potential cause of injustice under part IV. Therefore, concerns about safety must be balanced with concerns about truth and justice. If that does not happen, there could be disasters equivalent to those in Cleveland or Orkney. For that reason, I am unable to support this well-intentioned amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we take into account the fact that the amendment No. 30 would amend clause 1 by including a reference to family violence, some of the fears of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) might well be relieved.<br><br>
Two arguments can be made in favour of the amendment. First, the amendment would make better some sense of clause 1. It is unusual—certainly, it is the first time in my experience of Standing Committees—for a Bill to refer to general principles. If clause 1 is to remain in the Bill when it reaches the statute book, clause 1 should accurately reflect Parliament's real intentions and state not only how they should be interpreted in the courts—one of the principal purposes of the clause—but how they should guide those who implement the legislation on a more general level.<br><br>
If that is the right perspective to adopt on the amendment, we must ask ourselves whether family violence and violence within the home are significant issues in the context of divorce and family breakdown. Sadly, violence is common in many examples of marital breakdown. I wish that that were not true, but unfortunately it is. There has been some argument in the Committee about what the statistics tell us, but from our experience in handling casework on behalf of constituents, many of us know of terrible and tragic cases. I do not expect that my constituency is untypical and I am sorry to say that the figures of violence aimed primarily against women in the home is on a depressingly upward path.<br><br>
In Barrow and Furness, the provision of emergency services for women and families in distress is met by the borough council, which operates an emergency needs service. The figures supplied by the council are rather depressing, but I suspect that they are repeated throughout the country. In 1993, there were 81 referrals to the borough council; in 1994, that figure had increased to 126. There was a slight drop in 1995 to 119, but the figures for the first quarter of this year show that marital violence is on an upward path again.<br><br>
Violence aimed at women and children in the home is a significant issue, so it is important that clause 1, which is trying to identify the general issues of the Bill, should reflect the fact that marital violence is an acute and horrible issue. Physical violence in the home is directed at largely defenceless people, so clause 1 should reflect that and make it clear to the courts and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
other agencies that we take matrimonial violence seriously. The Minister may say that clause 1 relates to only parts II and III, which refer to matrimonial breakdown, separation, divorce, and so on. That is true, but matrimonial violence itself is a significant issue in divorce and family breakdown, so it needs to be reflected in clause 1. It would make clause 1 more effective and give a proper direction to the courts and all the agencies that will be involved in implementing this important Bill. The protection of innocent parties from the threat of, or actual, violence is an important general principle which should guide the operation of the Bill.<br><br>
The second argument in favour of the amendment is more general. One of problems in the Committee—the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle may have fallen into the trap—is that I do not believe that any of us, apart from perhaps the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin), has experience of the general principle issue. I have not previously served on a Standing Committee that dealt with such general clauses. We tend to assume that we are dealing with a substantive clause that sets out specific rights and obligations, but we are not. Whatever concerns the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has about part IV of the Bill, I do not think that including a reference to protecting innocent parties from the threat of violence will in any way affect the specific operation of the Bill. We are talking about a general principle and I should be happy to give way to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle if he wants to respond to my remarks. Because it is so alien in English law-making to have general principle clauses, many of us unfamiliar with the concept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I know, the practice of putting general principles into Bills has only happened in the past five or six years. The first time was in the Children Act 1989, which set out a general purpose clause in clause 1 that the interests of the child should be paramount. I think that it is found only in social legislation such as the type we are considering.<br><br>
There are, however, circumstances in which the general overarching principles can be misinterpreted. The practice of inserting such principles arose because of litigation in the courts about whether one could look behind the wording of an Act at the intention of the Committee and the House in enacting that legislation. The Government thought that in certain areas—predominantly in social legislation—the intention of a Bill should be set out in a general overarching clause at the beginning.<br><br>
There have been some complaints about the way that that has happened, even in the case of the Children Act 1989. Some people felt, and some feel now, that the interests of justice should be paramount, not the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
interests of one party to a tripartite relationship. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) has the same experience, but I receive a great deal of correspondence on matters groping towards that general point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that information. I have not received any complaints about the operation of the Children Act 1989, which is generally accepted to be a good piece of legislation.<br><br>
In general terms, it is probably preferable for Parliament, in the framework of Standing Committee deliberations or elsewhere, specifically to state its intentions in legislation, rather than putting the courts in the situation in which they have often been placed in the past—we are all familiar with Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart—where they have to divine in a magical, mysterious way the intentions of Parliament when the content of an Act is obscure. We can get rid of those problems and relieve the courts of the difficult job of trying to adjudicate on Parliament's intentions by specifying them in the Bill.<br><br>
Given that there is consensus in the Committee about the importance of protecting the innocent victims of family violence from appalling crimes, it is right that we should state that as a general principle in the Bill. When the courts have to adjudicate and strike a balance, as they must do in hugely difficult cases, they should be given a clear indication where that balance would fall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That raises the question whether the Bill is about family law and divorce, or family law, divorce and violence. The rest of the Bill is not about violence, but about divorce, separation of assets and care of children. I am therefore not sure whether clause 1 is the right place to insert an overarching guiding principle on violence alone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those comments, but part IV deals with violence in the home. Key clauses of the Bill deal with matrimonial violence. In clause 1, line eight refers to parts II and III. Our argument is that in relation to parts II and III, family violence is a significant issue. The bill addresses the issue of violence, admittedly in the context of access to matrimonial property, and seeks to regulate the matter. We think it right that that should be stated in clause 1.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South mentioned the interests of justice, and the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle referred to balance and justice and his suspicion that there was some abuse of the existing legislation concerning ouster orders and the protection of innocent wives and children from violence. My understanding is that the issue in any litigation is justice. The courts do not need to be instructed to decide cases on the balance of justice,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
because that is the principle behind their powers and responsibilities; that is what the courts are there to do.<br><br>
If there is any evidence of abuse—if people are manufacturing evidence—or if there is no evidence to support an argument that family violence has occurred, that will come out in the trial. We need not worry about that.<br><br>
The concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Stockton, South about justice do not need to be fundamentally addressed in clause 1 or in our discussion of how we might amend the clause, because the Bill, like all other legislation, rests on the principle of justice.<br><br>
In clause 1, we are trying to articulate our specific intentions about family breakdown—separation and divorce. Because family violence is a significant issue in family breakdown and divorce, there should be a reference to it in the Bill. Given that I am sure that there is agreement in the Committee that we deplore matrimonial violence and want to protect people from it, it seems entirely appropriate that the amendment be included in clause 1.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The other general argument about amendment No. 30 relates to the fact that clause 1 is a principles clause. We want the Bill to be properly interpreted and understood. In that context, and given the importance of matrimonial violence, it seems astonishing that the Bill makes no reference to that in parts II and III. If we take into account the comments of many organisations in the 1970s and, more recently, the Hansard Society report on the legislative process, it is clear that we need to try to ensure that the clauses are properly comprehensible. A significant portion of the Bill, part IV, deals with family violence; but clause 1, which sets out the general principles, makes no reference whatever to that issue. I am afraid that that will look like a gaping hole in clause 1. I am sorry to see the Minister shaking his head. It is important that we express the concerns of the House. I am sure that hon. Members in Committee and throughout the House are concerned that we take this opportunity to state our perspective on family violence. That will improve parts II and III and make clause 1 more comprehensible.<br><br>
If we are to embark on the use of general principles clause, we should take the opportunity to make such use comprehensive. We should make it reach into those parts of the Bill where it can do most good and where we can make it a useful instrument for the courts rather than just a bland statement of principles. Perhaps the hon. Member for Stockton, South is right to say that it will not materially affect how the legislation operates, but if the clauses are to be effective and valuable and make relevant statements, we should make them comprehensive and make them reach into all areas of the Bill where we want our ideas to work properly. We should accept the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every hon. Member who has spoken in the debate so far is deeply concerned about domestic violence. It might be helpful if I tell the Committee that I have sponsored several Adjournment debates on the treatment of victims of child abuse, working in conjunction with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. I have also promoted two ten-minute Bills on domestic violence.<br><br>
We must be absolutely clear that in tackling this horrendous problem there is potentially a price to be paid. The danger when the law is tightened—which I support, although I am concerned about some of the details—is that it makes it easier to abuse. In his excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle was challenged to quote cases. I shall mention two, one public and one private Kyte <i>v.</i> Kyte is one of the leading cases in family law and we shall return to it during discussion of several other clauses in the Bill. That case started with a false allegation of violence by the wife, which led to the husband's eviction from the family home. The second case is a personal one involving a journalist friend of mine who was evicted from his family home because of allegations of violence by his wife. The case is sub judice at the moment because he has just returned to court with a whole dossier of evidence of violence that continues against the children. The case is likely to be reopened.<br><br>
It was suggested earlier, I think by the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston), who is unable to be with us this morning—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I meant the hon. Lady who was sitting immediately behind the hon. Member for Bristol, East—the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge)—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am not saying that the two hon. Ladies look the same. Not all of us know every other hon. Member's constituency. I apologise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that he does not look like anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, although I am not sure whether that was a compliment.<br><br>
Violence against children is, in one respect, even worse than violence against women because a child's voice and hope of redress is so limited. I have worked with several Opposition Members and, in particular, the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) on the handling of children in court. I am sorry that the hon. Lady could not be on the Committee; I hope that I got her constituency right. During our work, I was constantly reminded of the limited ability of children to speak out.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barking suggested that I had said that married couples were never responsible for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0064">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
child abuse, but I said no such thing. In fact, I promised to produce statistical evidence—as the hon. Lady did—and to show that men who are not the natural father commit far more child abuse than natural fathers in a marriage. That is directly relevant to the amendment. I have a document by Robert Whelan that embraces an enormous sample of data that the NSPCC has gathered for the Government from many parts of the country during the past five years. The sample shows that the danger of a child being abused, or at least appearing on an at-risk register as a result of physical or sexual abuse, is slightly more than six times higher when the child lives with its mother and a new partner rather than its biological parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been contacted by the National Stepfamily Association, which is as concerned with child abuse as any organisation. It told me that much of the discussion on this issue has become entangled with the wider debate on the change in families in Britain. The association will publish a review of all the recent research in June 1996, but its early evidence does not reinforce the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that stepparents are frequently or exclusively responsible for child abuse. Evidence suggests that stepfamilies do not necessarily encounter different problems from families in which natural parents are in residence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I received the same letter as the hon. Lady and I do not dissent. I did not imply that abuse occurs frequently or exclusively in step-families. I simply suggest that we must be deeply conscious of the fact that the most comprehensive survey on the issue to date shows that a child is six times more likely to be abused in a relationship that involves a male other than its natural father.<br><br>
The relevance of my point is simple. Clause 1 applies to parts II and III of the Bill—it is not a guide to part IV on domestic violence. When we decide whether the courts should, prima facie, consider domestic violence as one of their guiding principles when they deal with divorce, we must ask ourselves whether children would be more likely to face abuse if a marriage broke up than if it did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been closely following the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I fail to see its relevance to the amendment, which speaks of having
<br><blockquote><p>"due regard to the need to avoid the risk of violence being directed at either or both parties or any children affected".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman is clearly and properly anxious about violence against children. I agree with him that those children may not have a voice in the family. All members of the Committee must take account of that, but I fail to understand the relevance to the overarching principle of statistics that may show that children are more vulnerable either in the first marriage or in a subsequent relationship.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady had waited for me to develop my point, she would have heard the answer. I do not mean that rudely as I know that the hon. Members are worried about the matter, but I have been on my feet for only five minutes and I have already given way three times. It would be better if I were able to develop my point as I do not have a great deal to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was rather unworthy of the hon. Lady. I have been involved in this issue since I came into the House of Commons nine years ago. I have spent more time on the Floor of the House dealing with questions of child abuse than with any other matter. I should be grateful if the hon. Lady, to whom I gave way, would remain courteous. I have known her for more than half of my life—we have been friends and I am sure that we will remain so, but this is a serious matter and it deserves serious consideration.<br><br>
The amendment asks whether the courts should have the question of domestic violence at the front of their minds when they consider divorce under parts II and III of the Bill, as opposed to when they specifically consider ouster orders. Part IV of the Bill will strengthen greatly the duties as well as the powers of the courts with regard to domestic violence. I welcome that strengthening, although I have reservations about some of the details.<br><br>
However, in strengthening those powers—and in some cases compelling the courts to take action—we are liable to increase the potential for unscrupulous use of the mechanisms by which people can allege domestic violence. That would have the knock-on effect of hardening the hearts of some judges who are already extremely sceptical about what children say to them in court. The Committee has heard examples of that from the hon. Member for Bristol, East and from the hon. Member for Barking, who is not present at the moment. The point has been made by people from right across the political spectrum, indeed it was made most articulately by the wife of the Leader of the Opposition in a recent speech.<br><br>
How do we strike a balance on this matter? All hon. members are worried about domestic violence, but I believe that it would be wholly wrong to go even further that the greatly strengthened powers in part IV. We should not suggest that courts should put domestic violence at the top of their agenda when they are in parts II and III mode—an awful expression, by it I mean when they are simply considering divorce and are not examining the question of ouster orders. The evidence is that domestic violence, especially against children, is much more common when a relationship has broken up than when the primary relationship involving the natural father is intact.<br><br>
Clause 1 is the wrong place for the amendment. We should wait until we reach part IV of the Bill before we take further steps in the matter.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the amount of thought that the hon. Gentleman gives to these matters. The amendment would ensure that all those who exercise functions under the Bill take into account the importance of combating the detrimental impact of violence on the people involved and on their children. It is not simply a matter for the courts—it is for mediators, the Lord Chancellor and all those who exercise a function under the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is passionately concerned for children. Does he not want the question of violence against children to be taken into account by everybody?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that I am very keen that the issue of domestic violence should be central to the consideration whenever it arises in the courts. That is true whether the domestic violence has a criminal aspect—and that is what most of my work on the matter in the House has involved—or whether it arises in a civil capacity in decisions about ouster or non-molestation orders. Judges should be willing to listen to the views of women who have suffered. We have heard some heart-rendering examples from Opposition Members. Even more importantly, though, judges should be willing to listen to children who have suffered. They often find it difficult to put their views forward.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
What I am not in favour or, for reasons that I have tried to explain, is the suggestion that over and above those mechanisms the powers should be up front, as it were, in divorce law. That is likely to make judges, court welfare officers and all the others involved in the process sceptical—and they are already sceptical enough. I completely share the aims of the hon. Member for Brent, South. I recognise how deeply concerned he is about children; like myself, he is a father of young children. Nevertheless, the amendment is mistaken and I shall be unable to vote with him in favour of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Regrettably, I was not present at our first debate on the extremely important issue of domestic violence. However, I have had the pleasure of reading the report of the debate which shows the seriousness of both sides of the Committee in dealing with the issues.<br><br>
I support the amendment. The hon. Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle and for Canterbury have argued that domestic violence may be falsely introduced in divorce cases and that allegations may be made that are not based on fact. Both hon. Gentlemen's raised the issue of false allegations in obtaining ouster orders. My hon. Friends the Members for Hornsey and Wood Green and for Bristol, East refuted those arguments and made it clear that supporting evidence is necessary before such orders can be granted.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
The hon. Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle and for Canterbury are labouring under a delusion. My experience of women who repeatedly suffer domestic violence over a long period is that they are extremely reluctant to talk about it. Many women feel—quite wrongly—a sense of shame and guilt. The idea that those women would automatically raise the issue and use it to bring a separation or divorce stands closer examination.<br><br>
My local authority, the London borough of Camden, produced another pack of domestic violence guidelines a couple of weeks ago, in this instance for the benefit of staff. The authority is deeply concerned about the general issue of domestic violence and recognises the shame and guilt that many women feel. They are often ashamed to mention that their partners beat them regularly. The authority has tried to provide structured protection for such women.<br><br>
I shall cite some of the facts from the most recent guidelines from my local authority. In 1995, there were more than 3,700 incidents of domestic violence in Camden. A quarter of recorded serious assaults in the metropolitan area are domestic. The most important and telling point, however, is that between five and 12 different contacts are made by women experiencing domestic violence before they receive a sympathetic and appropriate response.<br><br>
There is still a prevailing opinion in our society, which regrettably does not seem to be diminishing in the hearts and minds of the public, that domestic violence is minor and that it is something that the partner—almost invariably the male partner—has a right to exercise and which his female partner should accept in good part. I have even heard people say that violence is a proof of love. That is utterly absurd and totally unacceptable.<br><br>
Another disturbing fact in cases where a woman regularly experiences violence is that her children are in the same room or in the next room when it is being exercised. The hon. Member for Canterbury said that there was greater risk of children being abused where the male in the household was not the children's natural father. Is he seriously saying that those men do not have children of their own? That is difficult to believe. I do not attach much importance to the notion that children are automatically safe when they are cared for by their natural parents because I have seen that contradicted too many times in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing that. One of the examples that I used in my submission to the Royal Commission on criminal justice involved a married couple. All I am saying is that when courts consider divorce as opposed to ouster orders, it is not helpful to encourage the raising of the issue of domestic violence if it has not already been raised. The evidence is that children are more likely to be abused after a divorce than they are within a marriage.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but he seems to have ignored my point—perhaps I have not made myself clear. The hon. Gentleman is misguided in believing that women automatically wish to raise the topic of domestic violence. They often find it very hard to do so and, if a court required that such questions should be asked, it would relieve the woman of her sense of shame and guilt and of being threatened by the spouse from whom she wishes to separate. It is not unusual for men to threaten that they will take it out on their partner after the divorce or on the children before the divorce if the woman talks about the violence. Far too often, violence occurs after a divorce or when a woman has applied for a divorce and has left the family home she may be living with her children in a refuge. Her partner may attempt to pursue her and use violence. In some instances, he kills her. The threat of that violence extends not only to the woman and her children but to the woman's family.<br><br>
Because there does not seem to be any marked reduction in domestic violence—there are still far too many men who regard it as their domestic right to beat up their partner if they wish—any power that can be given to courts when the end of a relationship is being discussed is to be welcomed. We surely want to make the ending of that relationship as painless and easy as possible, not only for the two contending partners but for their children. If the court is required to clarify those concerns to which the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle referred—I would not go as far as the truth, but would settle for facts and justice—the court should also be required to discover whether there has been domestic violence in the marriage. That should be imposed on the court because it would prevent the woman's courage being the sole arbiter of whether she makes such a disclosure. Such courage is often hard to find because the threat of violence—to which the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle referred somewhat fleetingly—particularly if it hangs over children, is as palpable and as potentially crippling, distorting and damaging to the woman's sense of confidence as actually being punched.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Lady's arguments with great interest, but will she explain what she meant when she said that the court ought to be able to discover the veracity of the allegations? How does she envisage the court doing that? Does she envisage it referring the charge to the police as a straightforward matter of violence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was talking less about the court being able to discover the veracity of the charge than the matter of contested proceedings.<br><br>
To backtrack a little, the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle believed that the amendment would introduce false allegations of domestic violence, and his arguments were reinforced
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
by the hon. Member for Canterbury. In fact, women refuse far too often to introduce the issue of domestic violence because of threats. It should be possible for the issue to be raised in an atmosphere that will not necessarily exacerbate the arguments that will be heard in—I repeat—contested cases.<br><br>
I hope that members of the Committee will look favourable on amendment No. 30. The issue of domestic violence will not go away, nor will it be eliminated by an attempt to change hearts and minds. The authority and power of the law must be fully exercised, because so many women still feel ashamed and guilty, quite erroneously, to be the victims of a man's brutality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an extremely interesting debate, not least because it has exposed a clear difference between Opposition Members and Conservative Members. Speeches were made on different philosophical bases. While I do not doubt the sincerity of some of the contributions of Conservative Members, I was astonished by their content.<br><br>
I want to respond to the speech of the hon. Member for Canterbury, but let me say at the start that I do not for a moment impugn his concern for children or his great interest in this issue. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that he and I have known each other for a long time. I remember our undergraduate days with great pleasure—of course, as the hon. Gentleman would agree, they were a short time ago. I believe, however, that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle are profoundly mistaken.<br><br>
The amendment would attach a fundamental principle to the Bill. We are talking about the right of all members of a family to live family life without the threat of violence—no more and no less. That is our overarching principle. Whether proceedings would be weighted will be subject to another debate.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) intervened to ask how the courts would test the veracity of claims. She was perhaps hinting at the difficulty of doing that, but that is what our courts do every day of the year, whether in criminal or civil proceedings. Our adversarial system is designed to weigh the evidence in the balance and to test it, so that judges or juries—whatever the particular proceedings—can come to a decision.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A concern has been expressed—particularly by my hon. Friends—that allegations of domestic violence could be used to advance a case in a divorce. If individuals allege that they have been subjected to violence, those allegations should be investigated by the police in a neutral capacity and they should eventually be dealt with in a court of law, perhaps with a jury or in a magistrates court. The mere
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
fact that such allegations are investigated separately from the divorce case is a constraint one the parties, because they know that their allegations will be tested and investigated thoroughly to establish whether they are false.<br><br>
I do not know enough about legal procedure—I have never been part of a divorce court set-up, so I bow to the better knowledge of other hon. Members on the Committee—but, as I understand it, such an issue would not be investigated separately by a divorce court other than by the judge deciding between the warring parties. Perhaps the hon. Lady would enlighten me on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention, because it enables us to explore this issue. The amendment would not set up a process of investigation: it would establish an overarching principle. The hon. Lady is right that domestic violence is a crime. Last week, the hon. Member for Mid-Kent —I shall refer to his speech later—moved away from that concept. We are not discussing this matter because it is strange or unusual, but because it is a crime. The majority of cases of violence involve criminal behaviour, and a proper criminal investigation should be undertaken by the police. Unfortunately, far too many family law cases involve domestic violence either against one of the spouses—usually the woman—or against the children. Frequently, the two go together: a violent man usually beats the wife and the children. That is the distressing aspect of domestic violence.<br><br>
Our proposal would establish a principle and not a form of investigation. As the hon. Member for Stockton, South said with reference to the Children Act 1989, the interests of the children must come first. We are trying to ensure that people are protected from violence. Surely every member of the Committee would agree with that.<br><br>
There is a philosophical difference between the two sides of the Committee on this issue. The clear gulf between us was shown in the speech made last week by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent. I listened carefully to what he had to say and I shall be happy to give way if I misinterpret him. My impression was that his difficulty with supporting the amendment was that it would change the balance. He seemed to be saying that many women bring the threat of domestic violence on themselves by provoking their husbands or by making wounding allegations against them. There is a deep division between the two sides of the Committee on that issue. I doubt if any Conservative Member would say the same about an assault on the street, an act of violence in a pub or restaurant or violence between gangs of warring youths. They would not say that provocation or taunts are a reason not to punish the perpetrators of such violence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady earlier kindly invited me to intervene if I felt it necessary. She has not properly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
summarised my position. The pressures that are felt between the parties during the tortured negotiations of a divorce are not as simple as is suggested by the eruption of violence. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay that it is appropriate to use the criminal law to investigate and deal with a criminal act. When we discuss whether violence is a defining matter for blame and consequent activity in a divorce, we must remember that violence involves more than physical violence. The endless undermining and demoralisation of a person by a partner who knows exactly how to do that is violent in one sense as a physical act of violence. That is all that I was trying to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying his views. His comments confirm my contention that there is an enormous gap between the two sides of the Committee. A person may be dreadfully undermined by hurtful words, phrases or behaviour, but that can never amount to physical violence. It is a nonsense and an absurdity to suggest that they are the same; indeed, the law of this country does not suggest that they are comparable. The central difference between the Government and the Opposition is that we believe that, for far too long, domestic violence has been treated as the butt of music hall jokes and has not been taken seriously. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) said, domestic violence is occasionally regarded as being part of a relationship rather than an abhorrant behaviour.<br><br>
I was privileged to be a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee when it investigated domestic violence. All members of that Committee—which, of course, had a Government majority—were horrified by the extent of violence and by the pictures that were portrayed. That is why the amendment is so important.<br><br>
There has been a great sea change in the way that domestic violence is handled. For example, the police have greatly changed their procedures, for which they should be congratulated. In London, domestic violence units and a vulnerable persons unit have been established and they take those terrible crimes very seriously. The practices in London are now being mirrored throughout the rest of the country.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East said, when women come to see Members of Parliament in their surgeries about a housing or social security matter it sometimes turns out, on further investigation, that a dreadful and violent relationship is behind the problem. A great deal of fear, hurt and angst may surround the relationship. What is to be done about that? As my hon. Friends have said, we must ensure that the Bill contains the necessary apparatus. We should also commend the work of women's refuges around the country. Although they receive little help, they try to offer support and comfort in a difficult situation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Canterbury will agree that we need to do something to stop the cycle of violence. If children—especially young boys—see their mother being assaulted by their father, they often grow up thinking that that is the pattern that they must adopt. They think that is what men do. We must think about how we can stop such a cycle of violence.<br><br>
It is important for the Bill to contain the overarching principle outlined in the amendment. It is also important that we go on the record about domestic violence and not sweep it under the carpet. We must talk about the issue publicly. Opposition Members have spoken about the issue, as did the hon. Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) in a very good speech. She spoke of the launch of the zero tolerance campaign, which was one of the main recommendations on the Select Committee on Home Affairs. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the Home Office and Lord Chancellor's Department fund a campaign designed to raise awareness among the public, and in particular actual and potential perpetrators and victims, of the criminality of domestic violence, the opportunities for redress and the willingness of the authorities to treat the matter seriously."</p></blockquote>
Labour local authorities in London, Edinburgh and elsewhere have taken that recommendation seriously and put such schemes into action. It would be good to see the Government take much stronger action on these issues.<br><br>
In its conclusion, the Select Committee on Home Affairs said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The evidence which we received, and our visits to the women in the refuges and to the police officers who deal with the problem on a day-to-day basis, left us with no illusions about the prevalence of the problem and it costs in financial and, much more importantly, human terms. We were very impressed by the commitment of many of those we encountered in this inquiry: those who work directly in refuges and with the Women's Aid movement, police officers, probation officers, Crown Prosecutors and others. We should now like to see the energy and zeal displayed by the best in each service becoming common to all. Awareness of the issue must be spread throughout the relevant practitioners in the criminal and civil justice system, and it must be complemented by the full-hearted commitment from the centre of Government to guarantee that most basic of a citizen's rights: the one of living a life where violence is not feared and individual dignity is respected."</p></blockquote>
I am proud to have been a member of a Committee that drew up such a report. The Committee can ensure that we implement fully the recommendations of the Select Committee—in the main, they were widely accepted on all sides of the House—by accepting amendment No. 30. That will show that we are not prepared to tolerate domestic violence or to give it any credence. As members of a Committee debating an importing Bill, we should accept the amendment and make it a fundamental principle of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green invited us to

say that we are not prepared to tolerate domestic violence. Unfortunately, the whole debate has been based on a misconception. I must make it clear that the Government are not prepared to tolerate domestic violence, which is why part IV of the Bill reintroduces the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill that was before the House last year. Some in the media have argued that the Government should not have reintroduced it. If there is any division at all, how can it be argued with any credibility that the Government do not take domestic violence seriously when, in line with the recommendation in line with the recommendation of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, we have geared part IV of the Bill to codifying the law on that subject?</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument in the media that the Government should not reintroduce the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill comes exclusively from the Minister's party, not from any party on this side of the Committee. Again, any divisions exist solely within the ruling party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to press reports. It would be disappointing for the hon. Member for Brent, South—and the Leader of the Opposition—if all newspapers supported the Government.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have contributed to the debate on the basis of their personal experience. It might be helpful if I outlined my experience. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nat Conwy quoted Welsh Woman's Aid. I acted for that organisation when I was in practice before becoming a Member of Parliament, so I am aware of the difficulties suffered by those who experience domestic violence. I have played a part in trying to redress that.<br><br>
My hon. Friend for Canterbury has spoken on several occasions about not only the physical, but the sexual and psychological abuse of women and children. His contributions have been subject of many debates, during which I have been present. Before my appointment as a Minister I was honorary parliamentary consultant to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Children. I understand the impact of abuse on women and children. Therefore, it is rather sad, especially in view of the injunction of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness not to be combative, that there has been an attempt to create a divide in Committee by suggesting that the Opposition take domestic violence more seriously than the Government.<br><br>
My third experience was serving as deputy chairman of Tai Cymru, the housing corporation in Wales. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy will recall that Tai Cymru had to set up and fund a special housing association to provide women's refuges because local authorities in Wales had a negative view of doing so. The Opposition should know that not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
many local authorities in Wales are run by the Conservative party. Let there be no suggestion that one party is on higher ground and cares more than the others about domestic violence. The Committee shares an aim to do its utmost to diminish domestic violence. The debate is about whether the amendment would achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Ministers making a case for the amendment? He said that, in his experience, some local authorities were not sympathetic about domestic violence, or did not understand its relevance to the statutory functions for which they were responsible. The amendment would ensure that those with responsibility in the divorce and family jurisdiction—marriage guidance counsellors, mediators, lawyers or housing officials— had domestic violence at the forefront of their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I shall come to the flaws in the amendment shortly. The hon. Lady misinterprets the amendment.<br><br>
We are considering a general principles clause. As the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness and my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South rightly said, such clauses are rare. My hon. Friend said that his first recollection of such a clause was in the Children Act 1989. He may have formed the impression, having served on the Committee for that Bill, that clause 1 was a general principles clause, but in fact it was not. The general principles clause was first introduced, so I understand, in the Legal Aid Act 1988. My hon. Friend is quite right, however, to say that an introductory passage in section 1 of the Children Act deals with the welfare of the child and specifically relates the paramountcy of the child's interests to specific provisions in the legislation.<br><br>
During our proceedings we shall have the opportunity to debate many clauses and to consider a wide range of matters relating specifically to domestic violence. Many of the concerns that have been outlined will no doubt be outlined again and the Committee will seek ways in which to strengthen the law still further.<br><br>
The amendment relates to the principles clause, which applies to parts II and III of the Bill, as the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness rightly prophesied I would point out. In that context, one should consider specifically what the clause does. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The court and any persons, in exercising functions under or in consequence of Parts II and III, shall have regard to the following general principles".</p></blockquote>
In the context of the rarity of such general principles clauses, the character of the debate—high as its quality has been, on occasions—has in a way argued against the general idea of including such clauses in legislation. The one thing that a general principles clause is not intended to be is a general totem to which to nail any specific concern that the Committee may rightly have.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
It has been argued that domestic violence must be mentioned in this part of the Bill to give a signal, to send a message or to have it seen that the issue is mentioned in the first clause of the Bill. The hon. Member for Brent, South is a distinguished lawyer and will know that clause 36 has as much application as clause 1. It makes no difference at which point in the legislation a provision appears. In those circumstances, it is extremely dangerous to advocate mentioning a specific matter in clause 1 because one wants to give a signal on an issue.<br><br>
We should specifically consider the way in which the amendment would operate. The hon. Member for Barking said that the Committee should pass the amendment to give a clear view on domestic violence. As I said earlier, part IV gives an extremely clear indication of the House's views on domestic violence.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have been concerned with domestic violence in the relationship prior to marital breakdown, but the amendment would apply under paragraph (c), which states
<br><blockquote><p>"that a marriage which has irretrievably broken down and is being brought to an end should be brought to an end"</p></blockquote>
in accordance with the three principles laid down in the clause. Those provisions are in the Bill because they initially appeared in the White Paper that led to the Bill and because several of their Lordships in the other place suggested that it would be helpful if they could be restated in the first part of the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment would add sub-paragraph (iv), stating that when a marriage had irretrievably broken down and was being brought to an end it should be brought to an end
<br><blockquote><p>"with due regard to the need to avoid the risk of violence being directed at either or both parties or any children affected."</p></blockquote>
In technical terms, the violence is not defined as domestic violence, which is a flaw in the drafting of the amendment. The violence is spoken of as being violence that is directed at either or both parties, but it is not stated that the violence needs to be directed by either or both parties. That, too, is a flaw in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where exactly in the matrimonial legislation dealing with violence is there a definition of violence? I must have missed it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All the contributions to this debate have been hatched in terms of violence within the domestic relationship, and, coupled with my observations about its being violence directed from either of the parties, clearly that must be specifically a form of domestic violence, which the amendment leaves out. That is why it is flawed.<br><br>
In essence, we take the issue of domestic violence very seriously. Part IV of the Bill relates specifically to how incidents of domestic violence can be dealt with, and we shall debate that issue in great detail in due course.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
I invited the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness and other hon. Members to state those areas in which protection would be improved if the amendment were accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may not know that recently I met representatives of the Women's Aid Federation, whose headquarters is in Bristol. Their view, based on experience, is that amendment No. 30 is crucial. They said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The rest of the Bill without the amendment will make life much harder … for women's aid".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister please comment on that statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am at a loss to understand how that can be the case; that is why I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Brent, South and asked him in what areas he thought that the operation of the measure could be improved. The hon. Lady has just told us that the Women's Aid Federation considers it crucial that the amendment be accepted. The hon. Member for Brent, South said that he could think of two areas in which the law could be improved, the first being that the Lord Chancellor's Department should pay attention to the issue of domestic violence. I tell the hon. Gentleman that I can give a commitment on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's Department that it will have regard to the issue of domestic violence in drawing up the regulation. It does not need to be in the Bill to achieve that aim.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Member for Brent, South mentioned mediation, a matter also highlighted by the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping). When we discuss the information sessions or how mediation should work, it may be appropriate for the hon. Member for Brent, South to propose that the law in that area should be tightened. But we are discussing the application of general principles in the Bill, which should be seen to apply in each specific case.<br><br>
Sadly, there are too many cases in which domestic violence occurs, but it is unnecessary, to protect the people involved from domestic violence, for it to be mentioned in the clause relating to general principles; the amendment is thus flawed. If the Committee wants to ensure that people are properly protected from domestic violence, the examples raised can be dealt with specifically as the debate unfolds.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is extremely disappointing because it fails to recognise the central point of the amendment—which is to ensure that, in terms of the context in which parts II and III are implemented, we deal with domestic violence and the combating of the threat that is posed, day in and day out, to parties to matrimonial disputes and their children. The experience of those who have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
responsibility in this matter—the Women's Aid Federation described by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East, those who are involved in court administration, those who counsel parties to matrimonial disputes, and those specifically responsible for the welfare of children—shows that, all too often, domestic violence forms the context in which they are obliged to carry out their work. Our modest amendment would ensure that they should take domestic violence into account when exercising their functions.<br><br>
We say that that general principle should be specifically applied to every clause of parts II and III of the Bill. If the Minister is saying that he would rather the issue of violence were dealt with clause by clause, and that we should table amendments to each clause that would require the parties referred to in that clause to take account of domestic violence and its impact on their work, his argument is strange indeed. It is a recipe for prolixity and duplication.<br><br>
The Minister shakes his head, but if he says that that course of action would be right, will he give an assurance to the Committee that, should we table amendments to each and every clause requiring the party concerned to take into account domestic violence when exercising his or her functions—we can do so, and I am tempted to do so—he will concede acceptance of ever such amendment? If the Minister will give that assurance, there may be some substance to his remarks. But something tells me that he ain't about to get to his feet and make that concession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I am prepared to say is that, when I invited the hon. Gentleman to give specific examples of cases in which the amendment would be applicable, he could give only two such examples, one of which was completely unnecessary because it related to the operation of the Lord Chancellor's Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fine. Mr. O'Hara, I do not believe that you were in the Chair when the Minister intervened. Had you been there, I should not have dared to take as much of the Committee's time as I did in giving even two examples. If the Minister invites me to take him through the Bill, clause by clause, and give examples relating to each clause of how the issue of domestic violence applies, I should be happy to do so—with your consent, Mr. O'Hara. If that is what the Minister wants, let us begin at the beginning. We are saying that those who are responsible for the administration of justice—those responsible for the courts in which the Bill will be justiciable—should take into account the issue of violence.<br><br>
What does that mean in practical terms? I shall give the Minister an example and, no doubt, other hon. Members will intervene to give examples from their own experience. Anyone who will have to work under the provisions of parts II and III and the court
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
procedures that are to be applied will know, only too well, of the incidents of violence that occur in the courtroom or courthouse. I can give an example of the importance of magistrates court clerks taking account of domestic violence by providing separate—yes, separate—facilities for those seeking relief under parts II and III.<br><br>
I would not expect, for instance, a woman to have to sit in the same cramped court waiting room as her attacker. That happens in courts up and down the country, which makes the Minister's complacency breathtaking. It is not a pretty sight when fighting breaks out in the presence of court staff, and sometimes, of the tribunal responsible for adjudication. A mother may have to take her children to court to obtain an order, and those children are then harassed by the man responsible for her having to go there in the first place.<br><br>
Does the Minister want me to go on with further examples? We could do so, but it should not be necessary. Our modest amendment merely says that those responsible for listing, for court buildings and for mediation—we shall debate the planning of mediation and the facilities to be made available in due course—should take into account incidents of violence. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Does my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East want to intervene? Apparently not; she is just listening in rapt attention. Meanwhile the Minister shows no sign of recognising the scale of the problem.<br><br>
The Minister has said that it is not the function of the clause to send messages. Why, then, did the Lord Chancellor propose it? It was drafted precisely because it is right for Parliament to send a message—which we support—about the value and importance of the institution of marriage. It is equally right that Parliament should send out a message about the value and importance of maintaining a home environment free from violence.<br><br>
Sending out that message does not detract from the practical task of ensuring that violence is taken into account in all the functions under parts II and III. We are not in an either/or situation in which we either send out a general message or deal with the practical detail. Both issues should be addressed, as we aim to do in the amendment, which would oblige all those exercising a function to take violence into account.<br><br>
The Minister asked disingenuously why we have provided no definition of domestic violence. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy pointed out that no such definition is provided in law. Domestic violence is that which is brought before the courts under domestic legislation. It covers many forms of physical and psychological violence. My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate pointed out that some forms of psychological violence can destroy a woman's confidence utterly. Violence does not necessarily involve taking hold of someone physically and shaking them—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just made eloquently the point that I had tried to make to his fellow Opposition Front-Bench spokesman. I thank him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what that was about, but I am glad to have been of use.<br><br>
To suggest that the amendment is faulty because domestic violence is not defined in it is nonsense and not the Minister's strongest argument. He should have left it where it has its origins—presumably not in his mind, but in general trawling by the Lord Chancellor's Department for any arguments that could be made against this eminently sensible amendment. The Minister would have done well to have left it where I fancy it came from, because it is not worthy even of the Lord Chancellor's Department, let alone the Minister—and a different standard can be applied to each, I fancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Luff <span class='memberconstituency'>(Worcester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Think about it.<br><br>
The Minister's second argument, which was even more disingenuous than the first, was that the amendment is faulty because it is not limited to violence between the parties. Of course it is not—it was not designed to be limited to violence between the parties. The reality of domestic violence, as the Minister must know, is that such violence all too often occurs with the intervention of third parties. It happens only too frequently that a third party is brought in to carry out the harassment. There are well documented examples of people being sent to refuges to do over someone in the refuge because that is seen as a way round an injunction or order against another party. I know of a case in which the wife's family was used by the husband and his family to bring about a more compliant attitude on the part of the woman. It was felt that she was acting contrary to both parties' interests by not being obedient and by trying to stand up for herself. She was brought into line by her own family, at the behest of her husband's family, with violence. Such examples have not been plucked out of the air. They are part and parcel of the daily experience of countless women throughout the country.<br><br>
I turn next to the contributions of the hon. Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle and for Canterbury. To suggest that the amendment should not be supported because it might induce false allegations is incredible. If that were so, a whole tranche of law which exists to protect citizens would have to be abandoned in case a false allegation was made. Will the Government use that argument against legislation on stalking when they finally summon up the courage to do something about Stalking? Will they decide against such legislation because too many bad women are waiting for the opportunity to accuse innocent men of stalking them, and a law against stalking might be misused by bad women? That is the logic behind the argument used by the Members for Gainsborough and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0072">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
Horncastle and for Canterbury—that we should not have a law that can be misused.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The Minister rightly chose not to respond to those arguments because, to do so, and to give them any credence at all, would be an absolute disaster as far as establishing proper framework for the law is concerned. We have a law to deal with a specific mischief, and we trust the courts to interpret and administer that law properly and to do what needs to be done to ascertain the truth of any allegations. That is why we have courts, and if we do not trust them to do that, there is little point in legislating to counter this sort of mischief.<br><br>
I do not believe that it is only from Opposition Members who appreciate the problems of domestic violence. In an excellent contribution, the hon. Member for Batley and Spen urged the Minister to accept the amendment or at least to accept it in principle. But the Minister has not given an inch in that regard. He does not accept the amendment—not even in principle. He says that it is totally unnecessary. On that basis, we have no option but to press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 empowers the courts to make two types of order: a divorce order, which has the effect of dissolving the marriage; and a separation order, which provides for the separation of the parties.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 2, line 20, leave out 'and'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 38, in page 2, line 21, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'and (e) it is not contrary to the interests of any child of the family to dissolve the marriage.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 39, in page 2, line 30, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>`(4) For the purposes of this section the welfare of any child of the family shall be the court's paramount consideration.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment gives the Committee the opportunity to discuss the interests of children. It is beyond dispute that children are the parties most likely to suffer from divorce and all the more reason why Parliament should be solicitous of their welfare. We know that in court proceedings regarding the upbringing of a child or the administration of a child's property, the welfare of the child is the court's paramount consideration. However, it may be that nothing affects a child's upbringing more than the parents' divorce, but it is unlikely that the court will regard the child's welfare as paramount in the divorce process. The child's welfare will become paramount only if a specific issue arises, such as with whom the child should live or how he or she should be educated. That is a blinkered view and it is time that the courts and parents accepted that there cannot be a divorce without specific reflection on the child's needs and, if necessary, the sacrifice of self-interest to those needs. That can be achieved only if the welfare test is pinned to the front of the legislation, sending a clear message to the courts and allowing them to develop principles that adequately reflect the interests of children in the divorce process. That may or may not include the briefing of court welfare officers in appropriate cases to investigate the effect of a proposed order on the children.<br><br>
It may be said that clause 10, which refers to the hardship bar, reflects those concerns by requiring the courts to have regard to the interests of children as a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
hardship factor for refusing a divorce. Experience of the grave financial or other hardship section in the present legislation gives no confidence that the court will interpret an exception other than in a very restrictive way. Very few hardship defences succeed under the current law. The approach of the courts may differ in the new regime but it is highly doubtful that it will do so. In any case, if children's welfare is to appear in the legislation as a relevant factor, as it does in the hardship bar in clause 10, there is no good reason why it should not be advanced at the forefront of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I well understand my hon. Friend's concern about children's position in the family, but as he rightly judges, it is my view that clause 10 addresses his point. The provisions of the hardship bar in clause 10 have been extended. My hon. Friend will know that under the current law, there is a hardship bar that applies only in cases when the ground for divorce is five years' separation without consent. Inevitably, the Government had to consider whether the hardship bar that was so limited should apply more generally under the new ground for divorce. There will be only one ground for divorce-the expiry of the period for reflection and consideration, which following my hon. Friend's advocacy before the whole House, will now be a period of 18 months, although capable of being foreshortened for some of the reasons that he outlined. That will be the new ground for divorce and, in those circumstances, clause 10 provides the hardship bar in all such cases.<br><br>
An order preventing divorce can be made by the court when it is satisfied that the legal dissolution of the marriage would result not only in financial but substantial other hardship to a child of the family, and that it would be wrong in all the circumstances, including the interests of any child of the family, for the marriage to be dissolved.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is arguing that it is preferable to move that requirement further up into the Bill. However, my view is that it is satisfactorily covered within clause 10. A slight disadvantage of my hon. Friend's proposal is that his scheme would provide for two different sets of circumstances in which applications for divorce can be made, namely those with children and those without children. The Bill sets out one clear ground, and the possibility of applying to the court for an order preventing divorce under clause 10 is preferable. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what my hon. Friend the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the first opportunity to consider practical means for giving effect to the intention that was discussed on the Floor of the House on Second Reading and in subsequent debates. We want to give practical meaning to the House's intention that we should do all we can to support and buttress the institution of marriage and the family.<br><br>
The amendments would provide a designated time for the parties to consider whether their marriage could be saved, in circumstances in which qualified advice and assistance is available to them. We want couples to have the opportunity, at the outset of such proceedings, to see whether an intervention could enable a marriage to be saved when it is in crisis.<br><br>
When we tabled the amendments, it was not clear which options the House would choose in connection with a period of reflection and consideration. They were tabled specifically with the intention of providing at the outset of such a period an opportunity to explore the possibility of saving a marriage. The importance of that is clear, as it is likely that, once a statement has been filed and the process—which has at its heart the purposes of securing and settling arrangements for finance and for children—begins, it will be all too difficult to carve out a space for reconciliation; it is likely that attitudes will have hardened, and that process will drive inexorably to the dissolution of a marriage.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Practical experience teaches us that if there is to be an intervention that is likely to have some chance of success, it has to be made early. That is what lies behind the amendments, which would require a party seeking divorce to attend a meeting with a marriage guidance counsellor within 28 days of attending the information meetings proposed in the Bill. There would be no requirement that the other party should attend the same or any other meeting, unless both parties were seeking the divorce. That is important, as it would not be acceptable to require both parties to attend a meeting—all too often, experience shows that there is a need at the outset for the party who is seeking a divorce to consider whether it is possible to effect a successful reconciliation. All too often, that first visit to a lawyer—or, in future, to an information meeting—to initiate proceedings is a cry for help and a sign that something is seriously wrong. It is not necessarily evidence of a determined and fixed intent to end a marriage.<br><br>
We are saying that there should be an opportunity for such a party—in private, in a one-to-one meeting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
with a qualified person—to explore whether there is scope for saving the marriage. That does not mean compulsory counselling, which is a contradiction in terms. Of its nature, counselling—if it is to have any chance of leading to reconciliation—must be sought; attendance at the meeting is the only element of our proposal that is mandatory. If the party does not want to proceed to counselling or to attempt reconciliation, he or she may file a statement of marital breakdown after 28 days. Indeed, under our proposals, the Lord Chancellor may, by regulation, exempt certain categories from attendance at the meeting.<br><br>
Our proposals are designed to provide a practical opportunity for exploration of a step that may or may not be taken, followed by a period of reflection and consideration on whether, in the light of advice that has been given and information that has been conveyed, the next step should be taken and a statement filed.<br><br>
The amendments would create a window of opportunity. That is not to say that that window would always lead to reconciliation—the parties may have a fixed intention, they may have already entered other relationships or been living apart for a length of time that makes any hope of reconciliation unrealistic. But at least there is a practical opportunity written in the Bill for reconciliation.<br><br>
I said at the outset that the amendments were tabled before the debate on the Floor of the House about the appropriate period for reflection and consideration. The House determined that the period set aside for that purpose should be 18 months. During that debate, I expressed concern that that period would not achieve what those who proposed it intended.<br><br>
The pressure to dispose of outstanding matters relating to finance and children would occur during the first 12 months, and in the remaining six months the parties would simply be waiting expectantly for the end of the marriage, their intentions already firm and fixed. The six months at the end of the process would not be used for the purposes of considering whether the marriage could be saved; they would be a waste of time. Indeed, they might be worse than that—they might be a time during which attitudes hardened still further and bitterness set in as a result of the parties still being tied together when they did not wish it.<br><br>
Therefore, I expressed concern about setting that period of time. Nevertheless, that is what the House determined, and we must live with that. Obviously, we must rethink our proposals concerning what should occur at the outset. The amendments would, in effect, add up to another two months to the 18-month period that the House has determined should be set aside for reflection and consideration—extending the period to 20 months.<br><br>
I see that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has tabled an amendment that would, in effect, extend the period to 23 months—almost two
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
years. That would be the consequence of setting a compulsory period of three months between attendance at the information session and the filing of the statement before it was possible to progress to the next stage. That would be unacceptable. Either an additional two months or an additional three months seem to us an excessive period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is trying to say is admirable. What worries me is the fact that there is already a huge waiting list for marriage guidance. Even if enormous resources were pumped into the marriage guidance system, the availability of anything other than a perfunctory session for the purpose of signing a piece of paper would depend entirely on which part of the country people lived in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on a problem that exists in relation to the Bill in general. The problem that he has identified relates equally to mediation. We have been pressing the Government to consider the practical implications for the creation of an infrastructure such as the Bill would require. I share the hon. Gentleman's concern. The amendments flag up the need for the opportunity for marriage guidance counselling to be written into the Bill. We should identify that as a route that offers some hope of saving a marriage. We seek the Government's assurance on that.<br><br>
Let us be clear what is said by those currently responsible for marriage guidance. A document produced by Relate states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unless counselling is included as a central component in divorce law reform, couples are unlikely to reflect on the enormity of the decision to end a marriage. The opportunity to save some marriages will be lost, and couples will be forced to make arrangements for the future without dealing with the unresolved issues from the past. It is this failure to deal with the past that is so often responsible for ongoing conflict. This may lead to an increased risk of failure in subsequent relationships".</p></blockquote>
The Opposition believe, and I hope that some on the side of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent share the view, that Relate have got it right. We must include counselling as a central component in divorce law reform. Relate and the other marriage guidance bodies, as well as the Government, are faced with the challenge of establishing an infrastructure to allow that. We must find a way of doing so, if the Bill is to achieve the objectives set for it in the White Paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"to support the institution of marriage"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"to include practical steps to prevent the irretrievable breakdown of marriage".</p></blockquote>
We must make counselling available at the onset of the process, rather than leaving it to the end in the belief that by extending the period for reflection and consideration, we will make a real contribution to the process—a view that, in my respectful submission, is totally misconceived. Unless we offer counselling at the beginning, we will lose the vital opportunity—the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
only opportunity, I suspect—to save marriages that are capable of being saved.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The Opposition have no unrealistic expectations. We accept the thrust of the research that shows that only a limited number of marriages can benefit from marriage guidance counselling as a means of effecting reconciliation. A study by Bristol university showed that reconciliation could be seen as the outcome of counselling in one in ten defended divorce cases. That was a small sample of petitions that were resisted because one party did not want to divorce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Jim Lester <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Should not we take account of the views of the Association of Family Court Welfare Officers, whose members live with such problems from day to day probably far more than eminent lawyers; they deal with such problems all the time, whereas lawyers take such cases only occasionally? In its submission on the Bill, the association stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"It should also be borne in mind that, in the majority of cases before the court, the relationship between the parties has been breaking down over a considerable period and the application made for divorce may be the culminating act of many years `consideration and reflection' and attempts to effect reconciliation."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is correct. Clearly, in some instances, there will be no hope of reconciliation. Sadly, so long as marriage guidance counselling remains underfunded and, therefore, not as readily available as we should like, the amendment would represent the first opportunity that many people had to meet a qualified marriage guidance counsellor. The majority of people in marital crisis have no opportunity to meet a marriage guidance counsellor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. In fact, the same embarrassments and shames that the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate mentioned in relation to violence operate strongly in cases of marital breakdown. One of the principle reasons that people do not receive marriage guidance is that they are too ashamed to consider applying for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. All the more reason therefore, to write into the Bill pathways to such marriage guidance that do not involve any sense of shame and failure; and to ensure that there are opportunities for the party initiating the divorce at least to have access to non-judgmental marriage guidance. Relate called that a "central component" of divorce law reform. All the more reason, moreover, to ensure that there is an opportunity for the parties to move on from that to full counselling if they wish.<br><br>
Clearly, the opportunity to consider in its entirety has been missed. We should have followed the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
example of Australia, New Zealand and Canada. When they legislated on the dissolution of marriage, they took the opportunity to consider generally both the institution of marriage, to find ways to support it, and the challenge that society faces in ensuring that it is possible to enter into lifelong sustainable relationships. Unfortunately, those who proposed the Bill did not do that, so we are limited to considering marriages solely when they reach a crisis and are on the verge of dissolution. Nevertheless, we must make the most of what we have been given. The amendments would obtain from the Government a clear commitment from the outset to promote, encourage and facilitate reconciliation through access to qualified marriage guidance counselling.<br><br>
We should consider the experience of Australia and New Zealand. The Minister will have acquainted himself with that experience, so he will know that opportunities exist in those places for reconciliation and for parties to seek access individually or together for qualified assistance. That does not amount to a massive extension of the nanny state. It is not an unwanted and unsolicited intervention by the state into people's private affairs. People have chosen to enter into the public commitment of marriage and there is a genuine public interest in the maintenance of that institution and of a viable family unit. That is in the interest of the parties, of the children and of society as a whole, not least because of the massive cost to the Treasury in the breakdown of the social fabric.<br><br>
The Library produces the figures, which all Committee members have. It advises caution in interpreting them, but estimates that marital breakdown costs something between £4 billion and £5 billion a year—a great deal of money. In those circumstances, society does have an interest in saving marriages whenever possible. The Committee would be failing in its duty if we did not do that.<br><br>
In Australia, the sort of debate that we are conducting here resulted in a Bill abolishing fault in marriage being passed by a narrow majority—the product of a bipartisan consensus. It was recognised that such a consensus could be achieved solely on the basis of dealing with the infrastructure of support for marriage. Pathways were created in and out of mediation, conciliation and legal court-based action.<br><br>
New Zealand went still further down that route. Considerable research was conducted into the issue and it was found that counselling was of great assistance in helping people to recover from the changes to their psychological health as a result of marital breakdown and in assisting with conciliation over access issues. Even when counselling had not brought about reconciliation, the mere fact that counselling had taken place was of assistance in the subsequent process of reaching agreements about the children.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
Those were the two issues on which counselling was found to be most effective, but it was also found valuable in moving towards custody agreements and in working out a framework for deciding the future of the matrimonial home and the division of property. All the evidence, based on the New Zealand experience, suggests that counselling at an early stage with qualified persons taking responsibility has spin-offs over and above those achieved in terms of reconciliation.<br><br>
At the end of the day, a relatively small proportion of marriages—perhaps one in 20—might be saved as a result of the intervention of a counsellor. The number might be less than that—we do not know—but one of our arguments has been that we need to be in the business of deciding how further research into the subject should be conducted. We hope to have an opportunity to discuss that in later Committee sittings or, indeed, on Report. Research on the subject is patchy, and while only a limited number of marriages may be capable of being saved, other benefits will arise from the availability of conciliation and counselling services—benefits that will work their way through the process at a later date. Again, I stress that benefits will be able effectively to manifest themselves only in terms of achieving the legislation's objectives as set out by the House—saving marriages that can be saved or otherwise ensuring that the process proceeds with the minimum acrimony and the greatest consideration for the children. Those benefits will be achieved only if the objectives are applied at the outset and not left to the end of proceedings.<br><br>
There is another issue that provokes considerable anxiety on the part of Opposition Members bearing in mind the new context in which we are considering the amendments: the impact of the period for reflection and consideration on the chances of effective reconciliation. The matter was the subject of an article by Ms Rebecca Bailey-Harris, a professor of law at the university of Bristol, in <i>Family Law</i> in November last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a product of the same law faculty, I would agree with that. The Minister will know that the former Secretary of State for Wales was also a product of that faculty. Bristol has done rather well on both sides of the House. Having declared my interest in the university of Bristol, and putting to one side the issue of the provenance of the research and the article, Ms Bailey-Harris asked—</span></p>
