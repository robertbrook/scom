THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING PARTS II AND III</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>]: No. 30, in page 1, line 22, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(iv) with due regard to the need to avoid the risk of violence being directed at either or both parties or any children affected".—[<i>Mr. Boateng.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I started this morning by arguing how important it is that the amendment be accepted as a central part of the Bill. It would ensure that domestic violence is at its heart. Those of us who are concerned about such issues are anxious that an understanding should be reached in Committee about domestic violence.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) referred this morning to the number of people who issue injunctions about domestic violence and who then return to their spouses. That is right; about half of those who issue injunctions do so. We should not be happy about that. It is not that we do not want marriages to be preserved if they can be saved, but the behaviour that led to an injunction is unacceptable.<br><br>
If our anxiety about domestic violence is placed at the heart of the Bill, we can then think about what action can be taken, especially in relation to concilation, to avoid domestic violence recurring. It is not good enough to say that, just because half of those who have issued injunctions return to their spouses, the matter should not be of concern to us. It makes it more important that domestic violence is the central issue; and it is why we should discuss what action must be taken to prevent it from recurring.<br><br>
I was worried by some of this morning's contributions, which suggested that it might be better to keep families together when domestic violence had occurred, because if those responsible for it entered new relationships they were likely to take their violent approach with them. Such an attitude is deeply worrying. It is not an answer for those who are locked into violent relationships. Surely the solution is to decide what action to take to tackle the causes of domestic violence, so that people are not locked into relationships in which violence is a common part of their day-to-day life. The way this morning's debate was going it extremely worrying. It is not good enough
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
for us simply to say that those who suffer domestic violence should stay with their partners because that violence would be repeated in a new relationship.<br><br>
The domestic violence statistics are staggering; my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) referred to some of them earlier. The British Crime Survey referred to 500,000 incidents of domestic violence each year. It is worth reiterating that nine out of 10 of those incidents are against women. It was suggested this morning that women's equality was encouraging equality of attack, so to speak, in that women were now attacking men as much as women were being attacked by men. Well, the facts do not bear that out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Lady was referring just now to what I said this morning. I firmly believe that the largest proportion of domestic violence takes place against children, most of it unrecorded. It is significant that survey after survey has shown that children are vastly more likely to be abused—factors of betwen eight and 30 are cited by various surveys—by a new man in a relationship than by their natural fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, we are all worried about the abuse of children. However, domestic violence refers mainly to violence between married partners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A different definition applies to child abuse. The physical and psychological damage to children is in a different arena. The hon. Gentleman may be right to argue that a man who is violent against his wife may also be violent against his children. However, the purpose of the amendment is to draw attention to the terrible and increasing incidence of partners in a marriage being violent against each other. There is also a growing incidence of child abuse; that too is dreadful and we need to tackle it. It is, in some ways, connected with the matter that we are discussing; but it is not to do with the main thrust of our argument; except that those who are violent against their spouses—mainly men—may also be violent against their children. The hon. Gentleman suggested that stepfathers tend to abuse their step-children. We need to tackle that—it is a serious problem—but it is not an argument for locking people into relationships where domestic violence occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the comments of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), would not my hon. Friend agree that one of the worst problems is the effect that violence has on the children—violence often directed by the father against the mother? Unfortunately that pattern of disrespect increases, starting a circle of violence that is tragically reproduced in the relationships formed by the children in later life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree. I would have come to that point later in my speech, so I am grateful to her for having mentioned it.<br><br>
It is worth reflecting on the statistics. The figures show that of the 120 women who were murdered in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
1991, 41 per cent. were killed by their partners. One in five of all murder victims are women killed by a partner or an ex-partner. Murder is the most serious of crimes. If we are worried about anything, it must be about that. It is another reason for making our concerns about domestic violence central to our consideration of family law. Indeed, the evidence suggests that our knowledge of domestic violence—as much of it as is reported—is only the tip of a much greater iceberg. The Association of Chief Police Officers—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If members of the Committee need to consult about the business of the Committee, I should be grateful if they did so outside the Room and not disrupt the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Association of Chief Police Officers said in evidence to the Select Committee on Home Affairs that domestic violence was "deep-rooted and widespread" and that known domestic violence was only the tip of the iceberg. ACPO said that the estimated extent of the problem was not based on reliable or accurate data.<br><br>
We have heard that as little as 2 per cent. of domestic violence is reported. We also know that 20 per cent. of those who approach Shelter because of homelessness have suffered domestic violence. A high proportion of families are separating directly as a result of violence in the home.<br><br>
It is ironic that women tend to be the most fearful of crime—for example, I will not walk far from my home on my own at night—and yet a woman is four times more likely to be subject to violence in the home than she is to be subject to violence in the street. That is an horrific figure, and it ought to suggest to us the importance of keeping the issue of domestic violence central to our consideration of the Bill.<br><br>
The other reasons why I think the issue important relate to who the victims of domestic violence are. Again, the best available data come from the British Crime Survey. Victims tend to be younger women—I do not know whether that is surprising, but it is depressing. Poorer women are more likely to be subject to domestic violence than those in higher income brackets. Victims tend to be women living in council homes and women from lower socio-economic groups.<br><br>
We have heard a lot about the desire to promote marriage. The women whom I have described are the most vulnerable to having their marriages dissolved. If we make that matter central to our concerns, we may go some way to ensuring that the proper structures and frameworks are in place to support marriages, rather than allowing them to disintegrate.<br><br>
As we consider the amendment and parts II and III of the Bill, we also ought to consider the fact that conviction rates for domestic violence are abysmally low. Only 14 per cent. of reported cases—we must remember that reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg—lead to an arrest. Even fewer cases are prosecuted, and even where there is a prosecution, it tends to result in the perpetrator being either fined or bound over to keep the peace. That perhaps demonstrates a lack of understanding of how horrific it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
is to be the victim of domestic violence, and of the impact that it can have on people's lives.<br><br>
I am concerned that the available data in the United Kingdom are so poor. We simply do not know how wide spread domestic violence is. I have been referring to various suppositions: evidence from the ACPO, suppositions that only 2 per cent. of cases are reported, and so on. The Canadian experience is worrying. Canada has made a more systematic attempt to collect the relevant data for well over 10 years—I think that work began in 1983. A national investigation has been undertaken to discover the extent of domestic violence. The results are horrific, and demonstrate why the issue should be central to our considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be interested to know that what she says about the data is borne out by the report of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the Home Office upgrade the quality of national statistics on domestic violence which come to the attention of the criminal justice system."</p></blockquote>
So Members of Parliament across the political divide support my hon. Friend's argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that improved data might develop people's understanding of the problems, which might lead to a greater understanding of why the Opposition believe that such matters must be central to the consideration of the Bill.<br><br>
Canadian data have shown some horrific facts—for example, half of all women had experienced rape or attempted rape after the age of 16 and one in four had experienced violence from a current partner or former partner. That is an enormous problem. I was shocked when I considered my circle of friends and whether people to whom one feels close are revealing data about their relationships with their partners. We need proper data if we are to consider the impact of domestic violence on families. I was delighted that the Select Committee on Home Affairs agreed with that when it considered the matter.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
We should also be concerned about the fact that domestic violence has an impact on a range of services. We know that women who suffer domestic violence are more likely to make a claim on the health service, for example. Extensive reseach shows that 40 per cent. of abused women find difficulty in sleeping and 46 per cent. feel depressed and lose confidence; therefore, they are likely to seek medical assistance. One study carried out in 1984–12 years ago, but it contained the most recent data that I could find—showed that 80 per cent. of abused women seek medical help at least once and that 40 per cent. sought medical help on a minimum of five separate occasions.<br><br>
If we are to ensure that domestic violence does not destroy families—this is not only an issue of maintaining the family, although that is important—we must consider how to prevent the growth of his horrible crime, which individuals commit on those whom they are supposed to love. If we can prevent such violence from happening, we can have an impact on other public services.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
Members of the Committee have stated that children must be central to our considerations. Some children experience terrible domestic abuse. Two out of three of the women who go to refuges to escape domestic violence have children. Probably all hon. Members have women's refuges in their constituencies and I hope that most visited them before sitting on this Committee. It is always heart rending to talk to women in those refuges and see the impact on their children. As a London Member, I know that many of those women come from parts of London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to undermine the course of the hon. Lady's argument, which is especially powerful and important in relation to the usefulness of women's refuges. However, the other day I was appalled to discover that a woman in my constituency took her children to a refuge, and was admitted, entirely as a ploy to strengthen her case for taking custody of the children. In fact, she was moving straight from the refuge to a home that her lover had set up for her.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot comment on that particular instance. Most of us who have experience of seeing in our surgeries people who have been subjected to domestic violence, or of visiting women who have sought refuge in women's refuges, know that, on the whole, those women have suffered in terrible trauma. I hope that the case that the hon. Gentleman refers to is the exception that proves the rule. I should hate to think that we make judgments on the basis of the abuse of abuse, so to speak, which seems to have happened in that case.<br><br>
I reiterate what my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East said this morning. Two thirds of children living in violent relationships have themselves witnessed the violence, which clearly has an impact on how they will grow up, the sort of relationships they will form and the sort of marriages they will enter.<br><br>
I welcome part IV of the Bill, which deals with some of the legal issues associated with family law and violence. We should welcome the fact that it reinstates the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill. I welcome the fact that it will implement some of the Law Commission's recommendations.<br><br>
The purpose of our amendment, however, is to make the avoidance of domestic violence an integral part of the Bill. Its inclusion in clause 1 will ensure that it is a matter of central concern both to us during our deliberations and to those who will administer the Bill when it is enacted—people in conciliation, mediation or information meetings and the lawyers and judges who will be involved in the process of divorce, should that become necessary.<br><br>
The example cited by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) suggests that there may be cases in which a woman leaves the violent home easily or enthusiastically to gain something else. However, the decision to leave the home is incredibly difficult for all those involved, especially as these people tend to be poor. They tend to be locked into council housing and to have less flexibility and fewer choices open to them. We must recognise that people who have reached the stage at which they flee the home because of domestic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
violence—and therefore embark on the path to divorce—are, in most cases, acting in desperation. It is a difficult decision.<br><br>
Such people are escaping not from poverty, but to poverty. Those of us who are trying to sort out social security benefits for women in refuges have great experience of that. Those women have to cope with children on their own, rather than with their partner, which causes enormous stress. They will probably have had to move from the area where they had friends and a network of support, which imposes additional stress. They may also have had to move the children from their schools, which affects the children.<br><br>
Those women move into homelessness. There are a growing number of cases in my constituency in which women get locked into the refuge system because local authorities have less and less accommodation to rehouse people fleeing from domestic violence. Some women also lose their jobs because, in moving from their homes and areas and having to take sole responsibility for the children, they cannot cope with work. That locks them into a further cycle of increasing poverty. It is because of that that so many go back, even after they have obtained an injunction against their husband.<br><br>
We should also remember that those who suffer from domestic violence are beaten down psychologically, not just physically. Their self-esteem is probably at rock bottom, so their ability to deal with many issues in their relationship is severely curtailed. When we consider matters such as conciliation, mediation or attendance at the information meetings, we must be conscious of the psychological state of women who suffer domestic violence. We must ensure a fair system that does not disadvantage them when they try to disentangle themselves from an unhappy relationship or, if there is any hope, when they try to bring the marriage together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely sympathise with the hon. Lady. Does she agree that the concept of domestic violence being treated as something different from ordinary violence is a great disadvantage to women? In common law we have provision for dealing with violence against the individual, whether within marriage or without. We should make better use of that, instead of treating domestic violence as something different and perhaps not quite as important as the violence that occurs when a person comes up to someone in the street and slugs him for the hell of it. We would thereby remove part of the emotional element from the issue, which I entirely agree with the hon. Lady is an extremely important social issue. Perhaps the Bill is not the right place to emphasise that. We should stress that the police should deal with the problem as they would deal with any other form of grievous bodily harm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady's intent, but domestic violence is almost worse than common assault. Too many women are too frightened to admit that they are subject to domestic violence. We must create an environment in which women who feel so low because they have been subject to it feel confident enough to come forward so that the police can take the necessary action.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the reasons for the Bill is that many of the provisions of common law are not available to some women who are faced with domestic violence? Those who have represented women trying to obtain injunctions—for example, tort injunctions—have found that they are simply not available to women in some circumstances. The common law has failed women in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Over the past five or six years the police attitude towards the subject has changed for the good. We are dealing with a culture in which, for the past 30 or 40 years, whenever anything happened in a so-called domestic framework it was considered not to be actionable by the police. That culture must be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with those comments.<br><br>
If the Committee accepts the horrific nature of domestic violence, we cannot deal with it as an afterthought or an appendage to the law. It must be integral to our deliberations and central to our work in considering and amending the Bill through the due processes of the House. Let me give a few examples of the ways in which it could influence our consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that the amendment is to part I, which sets out the principles for parts II and III. Part III is about legal aid for mediation and part II is about orders for separation and divorce. It might be helpful to the Committee to know whether the hon. Lady's remarks are directed to part II on separation and divorce, or whether they refer to matters to which we may wish to return on part IV, which deals with the occupation of the family home.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am assured that my remarks relate to both part II and part III.<br><br>
Let me elaborate on examples of action that we could take. Violence in a marriage is often the result of men feeling that they are the strong, macho, assertive partners in the relationship. The violence almost reinforces that macho image. In an odd way, that was somewhat evident from some of the speeches that we heard this morning. We need to challenge the traditional concept of power relationships in marriage if we are to prevent the massive incidence of domestic violence. If we took action that started to challenge those traditional relationships, we might do a lot to promote marriage, which concerns all of us in the Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East talked about the zero tolerance campaign that originated in Edinburgh, which were a critical part of trying to reeducate people to the idea that as a society we will not tolerate domestic violence, and that power relationships within marriage need to be different from those that have been accepted in the past. Such campaigns tell people that the authorities—the police, the courts and those involved in conciliation and mediation—take the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
matter seriously. They lay out clearly the criminal aspects of domestic violence for both the victims and the perpetrators, which is an important aspect of zero tolerance campaigns. I read somewhere that such campaigns stop domestic violence being a low-risk option for perpetrators, which I thought explained it rather well. I am saddened that there has not been greater support from the Government for zero tolerance campaigns to ensure that the insidious crime of domestic violence is tackled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Janet Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rossendale and Darwen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is largely Labour local authorities that have pioneered the zero tolerance campaigns?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, though it is difficult nowadays to find a Conservative-controlled local authority—and after Thursday, it will be even more difficult. Many of the campaigns were started two or three years ago when there were more Conservative-controlled authorities, but it was the Labour-controlled authorities that encouraged them. I understand that there was pressure on the Government at the time to run a national campaign, but they chose not to do so. I hope that the Government regret that.<br><br>
There are other things that we could do. Some of the work done in our education system to reduce bullying in schools may break people out of the cycle of violence, especially those who experience violence at home, which leads them to repeat the pattern. I have heard of some interesting projects, one of which was the Change project run by Stirling council, which involved work with men as the perpetrators of violence; some lessons could be learnt from that. The project involved only men who had been convicted of domestic violence and work was done to change their attitude to relationships, which was an effective mechanism in trying to break the cycle of domestic violence.<br><br>
We should support such projects and those involving both men and women—we shall be talking about conciliation later in the Bill. If men and women together can develop strategies to help them cope and handle conflict in their marriage, perhaps the incidence of domestic violence could be diminished. I hope that the whole Committee would support that.<br><br>
We have heard about the good job done by domestic violence units and the police should be supported for the spread of such units. They are good and their expansion should be applauded by the Committee, but equally we must show some concern over the tendency, which I have witnessed on one or two occasions, among the police services in various London boroughs to refer a matter to a unit and marginalise the issue by leaving it to the particular policemen and policewomen who pick up allegations of domestic abuse.<br><br>
There is terrible difficulty in tackling an issue of this sort because we are fairly new to knowing how to cope with it as a society. We tend to marginalise the issue; we must take care not to do that.<br><br>
We must consider domestic violence when we deal with the arrangements for children. It cannot always be presumed that the best solution for children is to have access to both parents. All of us will know of children who are petrified of their dad, because it is usually the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
dad who has abused both them and the mother. In the courts, there is a quite proper desire to ensure that contact with the father is maintained, but instances of abuse by the father are often overlooked and wrong arrangements made for the children.<br><br>
Although we want contact with the father to be maintained, we must be careful that we do not provide greater distress for the children should the father be dreadful. Access to children and the protection of their welfare must be linked to safety. I hope that later in our consideration of the Bill we will discuss the development of child contact centres as a mechanism for ensuring access in an appropriate setting, given violence against the mother or the potential violence that might be inflicted on the children should there be no centre available—and there are not many around.<br><br>
Refuge provision and access to safe houses should also be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way again. I was at a child contact centre last weekend. We all support their excellent work. However, once again I urge her to think about the relevance of her general speech to the clause. The fundamental fact, as survey after survey in this country and abroad has shown, is that the principal danger to children comes not from their natural fathers or parents, but from stepfathers. Promoting the clause, which does not refer to the domestic violence section of the Bill and specificially excludes part IV—it refers only to the marital sections of the Bill—does nothing to advance the case that she has been making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that assertion is not borne out by the facts. There is violence against and abuse of children by people close to them. I am not disputing that such a person could be a stepfather, but the assertion that violence and abuse come principally from such a situation is wrong. We must be concerned with the increasing incidence of domestic violence by natural fathers in families with children and a mother. The issue is not just one of stepfathers, although there might be abuse when a step-parent is involved.<br><br>
I wish to make a further point to the hon. Gentleman, to which he will no doubt reply. If physical violence formed part of a first relationship, it may well occur again within a second relationship. The cause may be poverty, parenting, family experience or joblessness, but once people have been locked into a violent first relationship, they are more likely to experience violence in a second. That does not mean that we should not deal effectively with the domestic violence that was displayed in the first relationship, however. We should take far more seriously the prevention of domestic violence, and that is something that my contribution attempts to do. We can do that through zero tolerance campaigns and by working with those men who tend to be violent in relationships.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those matters are dealt with in part IV of the Bill, and the clause does not relate to that. My point was that parts II and III deal with children inside existing marriages, and in the vast majority of cases—this is borne out by the statistics—those children will face much greater dangers from future relationships
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
than from their natural fathers. That does not mean that there are no dangers from natural fathers: of course, there are. However, study after study has shown that the dangers from a stepfather in a second relationship are many times greater than they are from a natural father.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger of our ping-ponging the argument across the Committee, but I must tell the hon. Gentleman that my prime concern is for women and children. They must be at the forefront of our minds and at the heart of what we are considering.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman cites research, but he should come forward with that research. No doubt, he will have the opportunity to do so. If Canadian research is correct, one in four women experience violence from their partners or former partners. The Canadians have far better data than we do because they have sought them. If those findings are true and British experience is similar, the issue of domestic violence should be central to our consideration of the Bill. The problem goes far further than being something that occurs when a stepfather is around—it is much greater than that. That is why I am anxious that it should be covered in clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady tell us whether the Canadian information on violence in the household splits the figures between those who are married and those who are not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady know what proportion of those experiencing violence in the household are married and what proportion are not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not put aside the paper, but such data appear in the British Crime Survey. I shall share that information with the hon. Gentleman outside the Committee, but I have lost the piece of paper on which it appeared. However, the British Crime Survey provides the best data on how much of the problem occurs within marriage and how much it affects those who are not married. Perhaps it is more likely to affect those who are not married, but it is equally an issue for those within marriage. The British Crime Survey contains the evidence.<br><br>
Domestic violence is one of the greatest crimes of the late-20th century. We are learning more about it and it is more acceptable to talk about it publicly and for women to reveal it to the police or others. We are also learning more and more about its impact on the family.<br><br>

If society is serious about its desire to prevent violence against the person, domestic violence must be at the centre of its concerns. That is the view of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, and I agree with it—it is the basis on which I support the amendment. If we are serious about the Bill promoting marriage and the family, domestic violence must be at the centre of our consideration. In that way, we can include in the Bill, where appropriate, measures to tackle the growing incidence of domestic violence and to make it less prevalent. In addition, if a marriage breaks down
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
because of domestic violence, there will be appropriate measures in place to protect the interests of the victims who tend to be weak, lacking in confidence and living in fear. We owe it to those women to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The House has been interested in violence in the household for a long time. In the late 1970s, Select Committee reports were produced on violence towards partners—married women included—and violence towards children. However, this is not the right time to rehearse what was discussed and concluded in those reports.<br><br>
In considering ways in which to reduce the incidence of violence in the home, it is important to know whether it is increasing and what the characteristics are. We should also be clear about the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury on violence in the home between adults who are not married, the view of people who do not live in the home permanently and the association between violence and abuse. I do not think that the Bill is the way to deal with most of those issues. We should ask whether the amendment adds anything to part II or part III and whether it embodies a principle that should be incorporated. Is it intended to stop people getting divorced or separated, or to help people who could not otherwise get divorced or separated to do so?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) made the important point that violence is illegal in virtually all circumstances and that people should not be afraid of doing something about it. The points about zero tolerance campaigns are reasonably well made. I do not think that the amendment should have detained us so long on clause 1. However, a general debate on ways of changing the culture so that people are not simply pursued for violent acts but commit them less often is important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that domestic violence does not relate simply to occupation of the family home and protection from immediate harm, but that every professional who has anything to do with the divorce jurisdiction, be they marriage guidance counsellors, mediators or lawyers, should have at the forefront of their mind the impact of domestic violence on relationships?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how that would be helped by making this kind of amendment, let alone this specific amendment, to clause 1. However, I do not wish to pursue that point.<br><br>
Finally, I wish to raise a question about numbers. If, as we are told, significant violence occurs in a quarter of marriages, and if we assume that about three quarters of people are married when they are adults, it suggests that each week 1,250 men—it is normally men—become violent for the first time in marriage. That is an epidemic, and it should be dealt with in a way that would not be possible under the proposal in the amendment.<br><br>
My comments in no way undermine the importance of tackling violence and the conditions associated with it or of reducing the level of violence. If the figures are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
anything like correct, we should know far more about the circumstances, and what can be done in the short term to give relief to those who are suffering. In the medium term, we should try to make sure that people learn from the causes of violence and, rather than simply finding it unacceptable, try significantly to reduce it. We should have a way of determining, month by month, year by year, the levels of domestic violence and how couples entering marriage and those outside marriage are coping.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have an opportunity to support this important amendment, particularly so early on in the life of the Committee. We are on part I, clause 1. We are talking about an important principle that can inform all parts, particularly parts II and III, of the Bill. Many of my hon. Friends have talked about the scale of domestic violence. I want to reinforce the headline figures. There are 500,000 incidents of domestic violence a year and 87 per cent. of them are against women. Domestic violence accounted for a quarter of all reported assaults, and research suggests that only 2 per cent. of assaults are ever reported to the police.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) mentioned rape in a Canadian context. I find it astonishing that the reporting of rape increased from 1,015 reports in 1977 to 5,082 in 1994. Against that, we must consider that the conviction rate fell from 32 per cent. in 1977 to 10 per cent. in 1993. We are talking about extreme incidents of violence, and extremely worrying figures. The hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) talked about the need for us to have base figures to set against the figures that we know. That is clearly right. Given the figures that we are talking about, it is important that we have a survey base to demonstrate the scale of the problem so that we can make social policy adjustments.<br><br>
I am extremely disappointed that although domestic violence has been on the political agenda for 10 years or so, no full-scale survey has been undertaken by the Government. Without proper research, it is difficult to work out whether social policies are working. Such a survey would heighten the profile of the issue and make debate on social policy more sensible.<br><br>
I was interested to find out the level of domestic violence in Nottinghamshire. The figures are not readily available. I should like to thank the Women's Aid advice centre in Nottingham, first, for all its work, but secondly, for the research that it made available to me, which shows that, in the financial year 1994–95, it received 3,536 calls from women complaining about domestic violence. It is still receiving about 60 calls a week.<br><br>
Coincidentally, those figures are almost parallel to figures given to me by Nottinghamshire constabulary and Nottinghamshire social services department, although those figures are for a slightly later period—the calendar year January to December 1995. Those two bodies report that 3,350 incidents of domestic violence were brought to their attention. Those involved 1,471 offenders, 992 of whom were charged.<br><br>
We have some real reports here, so if it is correct that only 2 per cent. of domestic violence is ever reported,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
we can try to work out the level of domestic violence in Nottinghamshire, which runs into tens of thousands of incidents. Women—now—are being abused in my county. In that context I am please that professionals such as Women's Aid, the police and the social services department have come together to form the Nottinghamshire domestic violence forum. That inter-professional agency is keen to establish the facts and to create an agenda for action—a way of working on the issue to protect women and their children and to reduce domestic violence.<br><br>
There has been a good deal of discussion during the debate about the position of children. I know of a children's home that has done a substantial amount of work on the subject, reporting that two thirds of children living with people in a violent relationship have witnessed the abuse. I have over the years spoken to children who have been deeply scarred by that experience.<br><br>
A suggestion has been running around the Committee that harks back to the Keith Joseph cycle of deprivation theory—relating to a study that has merit, but which is dated now, and which suggests that disadvantaged children, from an abusive parental relationship, become abusive parents. We should be prepared to intervene and to try to improve things for future generations in that regard.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Canterbury, who spoke on Second Reading and in Committee about the incidence of abuse against children, mentioned research that is alleged to show that stepfathers are the principle abusers of children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the literature shows that it is not particularly stepfathers, but partners of the mother.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a point that I was about to make. It is particularly difficult to define the stepfather relationship. We need to be precise about what we mean by the term. It would be convenient for us all if natural parents never abuse their children. Those of us who believe in the importance of families and loving, caring relationships, would, in a sense, be found not guilty. It is simply not the case that natural parents do not abuse their children. I have spoken to children who have been subjected to the most violent abuse, and who have been sexually abused, by their own parents.<br><br>
A new mythology is being spun in this Committee, to the effect that it is not natural parents who abuse children at all, but new partners or step-parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, it was no part of the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, who is not in Committee at present, that there is no abuse within families. His point was that it is more marked in second relationships.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is his position, I look forward to his saying so clearly, and to learning of the research that he will bring before the Committee. I should like to do some academic study on that research; all my research suggests that, although step-parents and partners abuse, the share of the problem attributable to them is not as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
significant as the hon. Member for Canterbury would lead us to believe.<br><br>
I hope to present in Committee—the Minister is looking quizzical—a real case study of work in a midland county, to support my argument. I am not convinced that the incidence of alleged abuse by stepparents or partners of parents is necessarily much higher than among natural parents. If we are not careful we could be allowing for a convenient get-out.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
One of the interesting things that I have found when dealing with abused women is their reluctance to leave an abusing partner. Again, some research has been done and the Women's Aid Federation has produced statistics suggesting that a woman is usually abused 35 times before contacting the police. That reflects an inclination to keep the relationship and the family together, but also the powerlessness and despair felt by many abused women. They need help and support. During our proceedings, one of the soundbites that we have heard is that the Bill sends out messages. I want the amendment to send out a message to abused women and their children saying that their concerns and plight are written deeply into the first clause of the Bill, which refers to principles.<br><br>
In our sitting before lunch, the Minister asked about the relationship between the amendment and parts II and III of the Bill. There is a view that domestic violence is a part IV issue, but I thought that the Minister's inquiry was genuine. Let me tell him how I think the amendment informs part II and III of the Bill, which deal with the process of separation and information meetings. The more radical women's groups have many reservations about how abused women will approach information sessions. They may be worried about their safety or reluctant to attend such sessions by themselves because the former abusing partner will be there. Clearly, from what we have heard in the debate, they could attend those meetings individually, but they need to be reassured that they can go safely, will be protected while they are there and will find a safe way back. They need to be reassured that during the session they can disclose to the counsellor that they are victims of domestic violence.<br><br>
There is a good deal of research, principally conducted by Hester and Radford, suggesting that women have considerable problems making such disclosures. The analysis compares the woman's experience with the view of the counselling professional, showing that there is a gap in perception. The woman may feel demeaned and she may have low self-esteem, but the professional counsellor may not necessarily realise that domestic violence is taking place.<br><br>
Our amendment would include, right at the beginning of the Bill, the notion that the rights of those suffering from domestic violence are acknowledged. Women need practical help too. At an information session they need to be told that there are refuges and that follow-on housing is available. Such practical matters weigh heavily on people.<br><br>
During mediation, the second step of the process of separation, a person suffering domestic violence needs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
to be assured that she will get justice. Women who leave their partners have generally been abused for many years. There have been repeated attacks against them, and they want to be assured that they will get justice, not sympathy. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) spoke this morning about his growing belief that women who have been the victims of domestic violence should perhaps not go into the mediation process at all, and that there should be a legal route—the present route—to get them out of those relationships.<br><br>
In all relationships there are issues of power, and generally the man is the powerful figure. The notion of mediation between a powerful male and a woman who has been disadvantaged for many years causes real concern. Our amendment tackles that issue, by writing it into the Bill that the rights of those who have been subject to domestic violence should be recognised and that their needs should be acknowledged.<br><br>
I am increasingly worried about issues of custody and child care. As a general rule, it is right that, on separation, a child should have access to both parents, and that parents should have access to their children. As a norm, that must be correct. However, my own experience and the growing body of academic research suggest that, for a small number of children who have been subject to domestic violence, it is not necessarily the case that contact should be pursued. Several aspects are involved. The mother must hand the child across to an abusive former partner, with the accompanying risks to the child's safety. Children have told me that they do not want to see their former daddy, as they would call him, because they do not want to be subjected again to sexual assault. Those are real issues that must be confronted.<br><br>
The amendment states that issues of domestic violence should inform the entire process, and it is right that that should be stated at the very beginning of the Bill. Access to children is no good if it occurs only now and again, and if there is no quality in the relationship. Far too often, the courts consider the amount and duration of contact, not the quality aspect, which I hope that our amendment would underpin.<br><br>
The amendment is important for abused women and their children, because it puts domestic violence firmly into part I, clause 1. I hope that the Minister is genuinely inquiring in his approach to the amendment and that he will examine it carefully. All over the country, women and their children are being abused. They seek reassurance. They look to the Bill without great anticipation, but they hope that there is something in it for them. Our amendment would improve it. I commend the amendment to the Minister and to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the theme of the amendment and trust that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept the thrust of the argument, if not the amendment itself. There has never been any excuse for violence of any kind to women or children. If women are beginning to be violent to men, it is certainly less of a problem.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
Domestic violence has always been a problem. I take issue with the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping). It has not suddenly started; it has been around for at least 40 or 50 years and much of it started long before that. The problem is hundreds of years old, but it has always been a hidden problem. Many women felt that they could do nothing about their circumstances—perhaps for financial reasons, perhaps because they still had a great regard for the man with whom they lived—and incidents of violence were not reported. In fact, until relatively recent times, the police would not become involved in such cases because they were classed as domestic incidents to which they should pay no heed. Many of us did not think that that was right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady be surprised to know that an acquaintance of mine, a woman of about my age, told me that it was not until she came to know me and my husband that she realised that domestic violence was not the norm? Her father beat her mother; her husband beat her; she thought that marriage was just like that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly. I was about to say that many children growing up now believe that violence and abuse are part of family life. Only when they have the chance to see how other children live do they realise that they are not the norm; they then start to tell others exactly what is happening in their lives.<br><br>
When I first sat in a domestic court 20 years ago—I realise that divorce cases are now heard elsewhere—men were brought before the court time after time for violent behaviour towards their wives. The court would ponder what to do with such men. The wife would often make a plea to the magistrates on behalf of the man who so cruelly beat her—perhaps every Saturday night on returning from the pub—saying that the husband would be taken back to the family. That was part of the problem. Whether she took him back because she was financially dependent on him or because she could keep a roof over her head it was difficult to tell. There must have been many other reasons.<br><br>
Women are now much more independent and they are not prepared to put up with such violence. More instances of violence are therefore reported and more action is taken. However, that independence may engender in some men the need to reassert their authority and dominance. We have all seen cases where the husband feels that he is not master in his own house and that he must assert his authority by being violent towards his partner or children.<br><br>
While I was absent from the Room this morning, reference was made to the Anita Roddick petition that was sent to Downing Street. I did not know anything about that—I obviously did not ask the right Conservative women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Janet Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Lady to a letter from The Body Shop sent to me on 13 September 1995. It clearly outlines The Body Shop's campaign against domestic violence:
<br><blockquote><p>"You would be most welcome at your local branch of The Body Shop to support our campaign. Please let our campaign co-ordinator, Tara Poole, know if you would like to visit your nearest shop."</p></blockquote>
I cannot believe that that letter was sent only to a selected number of Members of Parliament. I thought
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
that it would have been sent to all Members—especially women Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Lady says. I do not have a local branch of The Body Shop: perhaps that is why the company did not write to me.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might be interested to know that I received such a letter from The Body Shop. As the largest town in my constituency has, I think, a population of 6,000, it is not surprising that it does not have a branch of The Body Shop. As I shall outline in due course to the Committee, I wrote to Anita Roddick, outlining my involvement in supporting the Women's Aid movement and asking whether she would open a branch of The Body Shop so that I could visit it. Sadly, I received no reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should continue, Mr. O'Hara. From last summer, a colleague and I in west Yorkshire suffered from much of our mail going astray. Until about a month ago, it went through a particular sorting office in Yorkshire which regularly lost large parcels of my mail. I am not sure whether that has any connotations, but perhaps that letter was among some of those that went astray. We certainly lost much post to and from Westminster. That might explain it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This morning, the hon. Member for Bristol, East contended that three lady Members had been asked to go to Downing Street to present the petition on domestic violence. She said that she could not find a Conservative Lady Member to go. In the light of what has been said, I, like the Minister, can confirm that I received an invitation to go to my local branch of The Body Shop. I did that, but I never received an invitation to take a petition to Downing Street. Perhaps that is why my hon. Friend did not receive one either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Batley and Spen continues, may I say that while it might be illuminating for the Committee to know about the campaign by The Body Shop, perhaps we have now been adequately illuminated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a little about the zero tolerance campaign, which for my area was launched in the town hall in my constituency last year. We kindly invited the Member for the neighbouring constituency, the hon. Member for Dewbury (Mrs. Taylor) to join me in my constituency for the launch of this excellent campaign, which provides a great deal of information. When I drive round the constituency I see the Yorkshire moorland buses advertising the zero tolerance campaign.<br><br>
Obviously, the message is getting out and about. I am sure that, like the organisers of many campaigns, the organisers of this one would welcome more money. I do not think that I have come across a campaign or an organisation that would not welcome more money. The campaign is alive and kicking in my part of the world.<br><br>
In considering a Bill such as this, we should try to do what we can to prevent violence in the home. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
cannot just legislate for that: help and education must be provided and more thought must be given to the children in such homes. I say again that often, within a short time of a mother and her children moving from a situation of gross domestic violence, the mother is living with a new partner. Although she does not necessarily suffer, the children do because they are not the children of that man. What two adults decide to do, within reason and as long as it is not violent, is up to them. However, children are our future and we must ensure that their future and their safety are paramount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under Welsh mediaeval law—[<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members may laugh, but domestic violence was recognised in the 13th century and, under the codified laws of Hywel Dda, there were property rights in Wales that were not emulated in England until the passing of the Married Women's Property Act 1882. So as was mentioned earlier, perhaps domestic violence is not a brand new idea: it was recognised in mediaeval times.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what the punishment for it was at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will undertake to tell the Committee that before the end of our deliberations. I do not remember the tariff just now, although I wrote a thesis on it, but I shall come back on that point.<br><br>
In our considerations, it is important that we have some regard to the lead-up to the Bill—that is, the doomed Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill of last year. On Second Reading, the Lord Chancellor endorsed the Law Commission's views, which were referred to earlier. He said that that Bill would
<br><blockquote><p>"remove gaps, anomalies and inconsistencies in the existing remedies, with a view to synthesising them as far as possible into a clear, simple and comprehensive code".</p></blockquote>
He said that it would
<br><blockquote><p>"improve the level of protection available for victims of domestic violence",</p></blockquote>
and that it would
<br><blockquote><p>"avoid increasing hostilities between the adults involved so far as compatible with providing proper and effective protection both for adults and children".</p></blockquote>
The Lord Chancellor also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that the Bill will make a considerable contribution to the interests of victims of domestic violence. I also believe that it is uncontroversial in party political terms."</p></blockquote>
It was uncontroversial in party political terms, but I regret that among Conservative Members it seemed to be highly controversial. The Lord Chancellor went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We all appreciate the damage which can be inflicted by perpetrators on victims and on their families."—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 February 1995; Vol. 561 1255–7.]</p></blockquote>
At that stage, it was hoped that there would be an uprating or codification of the law, as happened with the Children Act 1989. That Act has been a great success, for practitioners and, more importantly, for children. The courts have become more accustomed to dealing with children's rights. I believe that the introduction of a codified system was right and proper, and we are now seeing its benefits.<br><br>
We hoped, then, that there would be a similar approach to this Bill. Alas, that is not the case. The

national office of Victim Support welcomed the provisions of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill, and was concerned that it was withdrawn. It recognises that some, but not all, parts of that Bill have been reintroduced in the Family Law Bill, but it is concerned that there has been a watering down of the initial intentions—no doubt we can discuss those matters in greater detail during our deliberations.<br><br>
The mere fact that there are almost half a million incidents of domestic violence a year is shocking. It is enough to reinforce the need for a clear exposition in the Bill.<br><br>
During the speech of the hon. Member for Brent, South, the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) intervened to ask about current remedies. In 1992, the Law Commission report, "Family Law: Domestic Violence and Occupation of the Family Home", called the remedies
<br><blockquote><p>"complex, confusing and lacking in integration".</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Member for Stockton, South was implying that things are okay and catered for elsewhere, the Law Commission does not agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The implication of the intervention was that things are catered for elsewhere, but not necessarily that they are okay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification.<br><br>
Members of the Committee have spoken about their personal experiences in this field, and I want to say a word or two about my experiences as a divorce lawyer. I often saw women who were fairly confident in giving their proofs of evidence to me in the office and in pleading for what was right and proper, nothing more—women who had brought up three or four children under the horrible cloud of domestic violence—reduced to tears and trembling. Within half an hour, they were prepared to settle for any old thing. I often argued with clients, not the opposition, because they wanted to be out of the building as soon as possible and, as a result, would agree to virtually anything.<br><br>
Members of the Committee have referred to power and the difference between one side and the other. I found that, frequently, the more assertive was the dominant male—a violent person who thought that he would be able to run away with everything that the family had put together over the years, often due to the hard work of both the mother and the father. There is frequently an imbalance. Domestic violence is endemic in many areas. I do not mean to be offensive, but in some places it is referred to as the Birkenhead wife syndrome. At one stage, violence was so bad that women thought that being beaten up on a Friday night was part of life. When husbands came home drunk, the women were beaten up if the least thing was wrong. They were bruised and battered but, come Monday morning, they thought nothing of such incidents and everything was back to normal. Surely we should not have that to look forward to and, more importantly, heaven preserve us if that is the example that we pass on to our children.<br><br>
Those desperate women thought that foul behaviour was almost normal. They stayed in the matrimonial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
home simply because there was nowhere else to go. They were hemmed in financially and were concerned for their children and about the need for a roof above their children's heads. Refuges for battered wives were established to deal with that problem. I accept that such action is not enough, but work is being done and I am sure that all members of the Committee wish it to be put on a more statutory footing.<br><br>
I also saw the same women applying for an ouster injunction. Again, because of their circumstances, people were conditioned into accepting that violence occurs. They obtain an ouster, as a result of which their husbands are out of the home, but they then allow them to return. That did not make the matter any less serious or any less urgent. I remember many a weekend having to draft documents in time for the earliest spot on a Monday morning, only to find that the parties were reconciled. That was my job and I did not regard it as a waste of time because the matter was serious and had to be dealt with.<br><br>
Later parts of the Bill deal with certain aspects of domestic violence, but I earnestly agree with what has been said about the need for a declaration in the Bill. I put it more simplistically than that: we are dealing with a Bill on divorce that is called the Family Law Bill and, given that a major factor in divorce is violence, it is almost incomprehensible that there is no reference to the need to protect individuals who are hemmed in by violent behaviour. The Minister may like to consider that when he responds to the debate. I would not describe it crudely and call it nonsense, but it is strange that the Bill does not provide for people in such a position.<br><br>
As has been said at least twice, the Bill is giving a signal. That was misinterpreted in clauses 5 and 7, perhaps intentionally. We are in a position to give out a proper signal to those tens of thousands of women and small children who are hemmed in by horrible relationships that they cannot leave. They are powerless and feel that they cannot go to refuges because they will have to give up everything they have. They do not want a hand-to-mouth existence, nor do they want their children to be taken from their schools. We should be giving them a signal that we are concerned about them. Surely that should be one of the Bill's main messages. The practical solutions to the termination of marriages is one matter, but it is more important—as the Bill deals with the family, and "family" implies adults and children—to state that message in the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Implicit throughout many speeches is the proposition that many women feel trapped because they are economically dependant. One of the striking elements of, and contributions to, the rise in violence has been the number of men who are increasingly frustrated because they cannot find work. Although it is a hard choice, many women may well find that they are the only income provider in the household. Paradoxically, that increases not only their choice but the risk that they face.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but many women can do nothing but grin and bear it. I do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
not want to argue with the hon. Gentleman, but that is what I have found during my 18 years' experience of divorce law.<br><br>
The notion that, in some instances, it is better to keep a violent marriage together for the sake of the children does not bear scrutiny. In fact, the damage perpetrated on youngsters in such environments is incalculable. They must begin life with a most horrible and poisoned view of the sacred institution of marriage. I cannot understand cases in which fathers regularly batter mothers. That might have been the norm in Victorian times, but—thank heaven—it is not now. I should not like the committee to endorse such a notion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to put to the hon. Gentleman some of the information that the hon. Member for Barking has kindly made available. The Committee understands why she had to leave after making her speech. It should not be argued that those who get divorced or separated are more likely to suffer violence. However, taking the index of all women as 100, the British Crime Survey appears to show that the chance of being a victim of domestic violence is 280—more than twice as much—for single women and 1,270—more than 12 times as much—for divorced or separated women. We should be humble about saying that separation or divorce will associate any individual with less or more violence. We should be looking at some of the underlying, associated factors and finding out what can be done to influence them. At the same time, we should be providing refuge and help for those who are suffering—whether they are single, married, divorced or separated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a valuable intervention. Frankly, I am not here to play the numbers game—there is a problem. The hon. Gentleman's comments might well represent the correct response based on good research and I accept it at face value.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
I am concerned about the fact that there is precious little reference to violence in the Bill. There seems to be more references to the word "amicably" than to domestic violence. In my experience, very few divorces are amicable; it is almost contradiction in terms. Most people bite their lip and one party is wiser than the other and does not become involved in a dog fight. Amicable divorces are few and far between. By contrast, divorces that have come about through violence are prevalent. That point has been made more than once during the debate.<br><br>
I was fortunate to make an intervention, on the question of the police, during the speech of the hon. Member for Barking. I do not pretend for a moment that the police were disinterested in the subject, but there must be a change in attitude. That change in attitude and training must come from above, because it will involve a cultural change.<br><br>
The position has improved in the past five or six years and police awareness of the need to do something about domestics is increasing. For many years, the word "domestics" meant that there was an impenetrable veil around an incident and the police would not get involved unless it was life threatening. I am pleased that the police now deal with such incidents, and I know that many police officers take a responsible and sensible view. Legislation has been introduced, albeit slowly, and that has improved the position. I make my case in all sincerity, but also because my brother is a serving police officer and I will have to see him before long. On a serious point, however, it is all very well blaming the police, but the police culture is thankfully changing. I should like to see it change more quickly.<br><br>
