LOAN RELATIONSHIPS: COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 278, in page 215, line 29, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury may by order provide,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 279 to 280, 312, 281 to 285, 313 to 315, and 317.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schedule is all about how to bring the taxation of collective investment schemes—including offshore ones—into the new rules. The amendments fall neatly into three batches, although they are all grouped together. I shall be brief.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 278 to 280 are the first group. Existing anti-avoidance legislation is designed to discourage investment in offshore funds purely to avoid or defer United Kingdom tax. The special rules do not apply when a fund distributes all or most of its income. To apply the test of distributing fund status, a rule is necessary to specify how distributable income is to be measured. Hitherto, the test was applied with reference to United Kingdom equivalent profits for tax purposes calculated as if the offshore fund were United Kingdom resident. That continues, but the amendment would make the calculation apply as if the offshore fund were an authorised unit trust rather than an investment trust.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 674</span>
Amendments Nos. 281 to 285 are about providing correct definitions of offshore funds. Alternative definitions exist relating to life insurance. They are satisfactory but only in that specific context. They have caught innocent situations when non-resident subsidiary companies hold debt for the purpose of their trade rather than for tax-avoidance motives. We have therefore amended the definitions accordingly.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 312 to 317 are the third set. They are technical amendments proposed by the Association of British Insurers. They would deal with the consequences when unit trusts or offshore funds move in or out of special rules for debt heavy funds.</span></p>

the holding shall be assumed to have become a holding to which paragraph 4 above applies for the second of those periods in consequence of the occurrence, at the end of the first period, of a transaction such as is mentioned in section 116(1) of that Act.</p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Ninth schedule to the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 2 gives the Treasury various powers to make orders. Paragraph 3—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman could shout, because we cannot hear him—some machinery outside seems to be making a noise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 2 gives the Treasury powers to make orders, but in paragraph 3 the Treasury has determined that it will not take powers to make orders. Why the difference? Why has the Treasury decided that it does not want such powers? It presumably feels that it no longer needs to. Was that the result of representations from the offshore funds industry? If so, who made them?<br><br>
Several practical difficulties have been identified with paragraph 6 on non-qualifying investments. The partial definition of security in paragraph 6(7) has many possible meanings. Without the definition, I might have assumed that securities did not include shares and investments. Because express provision
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 676</span>
has been made to exclude shares, however, the implication is that similar investments, such as equity warrants, are securities. The debt instruments that are excluded from the new regime by clauses 83 and 84 would also seem to be securities, so 'schedule 9 appears to apply the regime more widely to indirect than to direct investments. Is that the case? That is certainly the view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome schedule 9. When the Government published the consultative document on the taxation of gilts and bonds last summer, the Association of Investment Trust Companies and the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds expressed concerns about the new proposals' impact on gilts and bonds that were held in investment trusts and unit trusts. They were concerned that shareholders in investment trusts and holders of unit trusts should not be at a disadvantage to people who hold investments directly. Although the Bill has inevitably become more complicated as a result, the fact that the Inland Revenue listened carefully to what was said between July and November is appreciated. The changes are welcome, because we have seen considerable growth in both types of collective investment vehicle, and I am glad that neither of them will be disadvantaged. They have proved increasingly popular with private investors as an introduction to a more sophisticated investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best way to answer the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) is briefly to explain the clause and schedule. The issues relate to how an offshore fund calculates its United Kingdom equivalent profits if it wishes to be a distributing fund—that is, if it distributes more than 85 per cent. of its United Kingdom equivalent profits.<br><br>
We introduced amendments to enable, in certain instances, this aspect of equivalence to be calculated with respect to unit trusts rather than investment trusts. The unit trust method of calculation fitted rather better with the offshore funds than did the investment trust method. Investment trusts have moved towards an accounting practice known as SORP—a statement of recommended practice. Unit trusts have not yet moved towards a statement of recommended practice, but we anticipate that they will do so. Indeed, the unit trust industry is in the throes of sorting out a SORP for unit trusts.<br><br>
That left us with two options: one was to rule out any changes that the unit trust industry might introduce, and the other was to provide a power so that it could be accommodated when its statement of recommended practice was resolved. That is some time off, but I cannot tell the hon. Member for North Warwickshire whether it will be in six months, a year, 18 months, two years or even longer than that. It will fit in with the new rules, however, in the same way as other collective investment schemes do—by tinkering to the right and tinkering to the left to make it fit as well as possible. We have taken the power to ensure that when and if the unit trust industry comes up with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 677</span>
that particular accounting practice, we can accommodate it.<br><br>
Clearly, the distribution of offshore funds is a different kettle of fish. The company's position is understood. We have tabled amendments to the legislation on offshore funds in response to discussions with the industry. The amendments do no more than meet particular and specific requirements.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about non-qualifying investments. Securities mean bonds and debt instruments. The definition is no wider than that for direct holdings of loans. It reflects the definition in other parts of the Bill. The issue is the so-called 60 per cent. rule: whether an offshore fund has 60 per cent. or more of its investment in debt securities. If it does, it falls into one regime for corporate investors; if it does not, it is in the other regime. Put simply, if an offshore fund has more than 60 per cent. of its holdings in debt securities, the companies that invest in it will be considered under the tax regime as if they held that debt directly. If it has less than 60 per cent., they will not. That is one of the key issues that was addressed by the previous set of amendments. The provision is a response, not only to industry requests but to current industry practice.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for setting out those arguments, and I broadly accept her latter point.<br><br>
If there is to be SORP for the authorised unit trusts—I know that there have been repesentations from insurance companies with regard to a SORP under schedule 10, which we will come to shortly—various organisations that will be affected by it are likely to be reluctant to change their accounting practice, because they will probably need to change it again when a new SORP is introduced. Is that not the case?<br><br>
To return to an issue that we raised this morning, if there is to be a change in accounting practice in these areas after consultation, why is there a difference between that situation and what we asked for this morning with respect to investment by companies that undertake loans in eastern Europe? The Economic Secretary suggested that it was not possible to make substantial changes in that case, whereas in this case there seems to be some delay in the agreement within the industry. We seem to be saying that we will accept a SORP as a change in a year, while implementing a different change in the interim. That is not a straightforward way in which to deal with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Collective investment funds have tax regimes of their own: that situation is not new, but has grown up with the collective investment fund industry. We are not talking about a change, therefore, but something special. The legislation must address how existing practice can best fit the new rules. Part of the industry—the investment trust companies—has already constructed a statement of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 678</span>
recommended practice. When we consulted with investment trust companies, we found that their statement of recommended practice had been moving towards the new regime anyway, and could therefore be adopted.<br><br>
The unit trust industry is another discrete, defined group of companies that operates in a particular, well-known way and has its own set of rules. It was also considering its accounting practice—clearly, accounting practices evolve with time. There again, the question was asked: is there a recognised accounting practice for unit trusts that fits within the new rules? In fact, the industry had not got to the same advanced stage as the investment trust companies. In practice, the legislation has been drawn to accommodate the current status quo of unit trust companies but with recognition of the fact that they were, in any event, looking for their own statement of recommended practice. Again, a discrete, defined group of companies were dealing with a well-defined set of investments. We have ensured, therefore, that if and when their recommended accounting practice is put in front of us, there is a power that can be usefully used to accommodate it within the new rules.<br><br>
One of the three underlying principles of the rules is that taxation follows accounting practice. Therefore, we have ensured that when a discrete industry considers a change to its existing rules, we can accommodate it.<br><br>
This morning's discussion did not touch on a discrete group of companies doing one particular thing but on companies which have investments here and there and which are funded in a variety of ways. Such companies are not discrete in the way that the unit trust industry is. There are clear differences.<br><br>
On more than one occasion, we have taken the method of accounting used by that particular type of grouping of companies—friendly societies are one example, building societies are another—as the sort of accounts that should be followed. That is the thrust of the new rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand and accept the Minister's logic as far as the SORPs are concerned. However, I am not entirely clear about the distinction that she tried to make regarding the matters that were discussed this morning. The Minister described the companies investing in eastern Europe and developing countries as being few in number. Do they not amount to a discrete group? I fail to see why the Minister cannot accommodate the representations from those organisations.<br><br>
I shall not rehearse this morning's arguments. In any event, I accept what the Minister says about SORPs.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Tenth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be in the bizarre situation of having agreed six amendments to the schedule that were supposedly debated on Thursday, with the result that we cannot discuss them now. I should like to apologise to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary for not tabling amendment No. 357 until yesterday, which means that it is starred and so cannot be debated. I appreciate that she has had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 681</span>
little time to study that amendment, but if she were to study it she would see that it bears a passing resemblance to amendment No. 188, which has been accepted.<br><br>
The reason for that resemblance is the briefing on this matter that I received from the Association of British Insurers, which explained that Government amendment No. 188 was tabled
<br><blockquote><p>"following representations by the ABI for insurance companies to be able to elect to be taxed on an accruals basis even though the legislation would have treated their accounts as applying a mark-to-market basis."</p></blockquote>
The point is that the Government have accepted that argument in relation to life insurance companies. The ABI believes that the principle should be extended to all insurance companies. I shall not bore the Committee with the technical details. One of the difficulties is that a SORP—a statement of recommended accounting practice—is in preparation for insurance company accounts. Because the chapter deals with normal accounting practice, it will be possible to follow the SORP once it is finalised. The trouble is that it is not finalised yet. The general anxiety is that Government amendment No. 188 should be extended to all insurance companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue is the difference between life insurance and general insurance. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is quite right to say that we have accepted an accounting practice for life insurance whereby accounts are compiled on a mark-to-market basis, but are taxed on an accruals basis. The reason for accepting that is, first, that it was the standard practice of accounting and, secondly, the industry wants to change the accounting practice in any event so that accounting will be done on an accruals basis as well. Therefore, in the not too distant future, accounting and taxation practices will be the same: accruals in both instances.<br><br>
The situation appears rather different for general insurance. There do not appear to be any plans for a future change in accounting practice. Therefore, in agreement with the industry, we have retained the existing taxation for general insurance because accounting practice will not, apparently, change. I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that were the industry to start constructing a SORP, we would hold consultations, but we understand that our amendments cover all the worries of the life insurance industry—general insurance is not an issue at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On an entirely separate matter, there are regulations in part II of the schedule which relate to the corporate members of Lloyd's. Can the Minister outline what those regulations aim to achieve? Who are the winners and losers, or is the effect neutral? Corporate members are enormously important to the future of Lloyd's so it is right that they be encouraged to participate in the organisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that Lloyd's is rather ahead of us—in many respects, mark-to-market
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 682</span>
accounting already takes place. The schedule excludes corporate members of Lloyd's, but only in relation to loan relationships associated with their premiums trusts funds. The tax treatment of assets and liabilities of premiums trusts funds and of corporate and individual members of Lloyd's is governed by specific legislation which operates a mark-to-market basis. In English, I suppose that that means that Lloyd's already operates an accounting practice which is satisfactory as far as the rules are concerned, so it has been dealt with in the Bill in the most suitable fashion.</span></p>

INTEREST ON JUDGMENTS, IMPUTED INTEREST ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of brief points about the clause in respect of judgments. The clause might deny bad debt relief for ordinary trade debts if they are interest-bearing. Such debts are at least partly within the new regime by virtue of the clause, but since only credits or debits related to interest are to be brought into account, no relief seems to be provided under the new rules for bad or doubtful debts. It seems at least arguable that clause 72(5) will prevent relief being claimed as a trading deduction in the normal way. Can the Minister clarify that?<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
Secondly, what does clause 92(3)(b) mean? It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"interest on an amount which is treated as a money debt"</p></blockquote>
I thought that any notional interest was brought into account by schedule 8 paragraph 15.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Law Society is at it again. It may be helpful if I tell the Committee briefly what clause 92 does and that may answer the hon. Gentleman's questions.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, the clause brings some miscellaneous items of interest within the new rules for debt. The existing rules include all forms of interest however they arise; the new rules cover only interest arising on loan relationships. The clause is therefore required to sweep up other interest not arising from loan relationships, such as interest on compensation awards and on overdue trade debts. It also brings in interest computed to a company under the existing special tax rules for transactions between connected parties, for example where there is an amount due between connected companies on which no interest was payable but where interest would have been charged if the parties were independent of one another. In other words, there is a tax avoidance element in the clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments concern improvements to the rules for debt contracts and options including gilt futures and options. They are helpful amendments that were proposed by City practitioners. As the clause was originally drafted, it was apparently possible to construct something that had the economic, but not the legal, effect of a derivative; on the one hand the clause was too restrictive and on the other it did not go far enough, which the amendments rectify. The conditions that must be satisfied befoe a contract is a debt contract are now reduced; debt contracts linked to hypothetical rather than loan relationships such as gilts are now also included. That explains why futures and options City practitioners made their representations. It is a particular issue on which we were given particular advice.</span></p>

LOAN RELATIONSHIPS: SAVINGS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 198, in schedule 14, page 253, line 36, after "2." insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to paragraph 12(6) below,".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I can give you a rest from calling out amendments, Mr. Hogg, and let you have a drink of water.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 198 to 203 form the first of four groups of amendments on the transitional clause. They improve the way in which interest is dealt with during in the transitional period. That is the key issue raised in the consultation process. Concerns were expressed that the proposed transitional period was too long. It was originally due to be six years, but has now been reduced to one year. The proposed amendments provide improvements, following representations on the transitional rules for assessment and relief of interest. Interest is often assessed or relieved as it is paid at the moment. Transitional rules are therefore needed to move from that basis to the new accruals or mark-to-market basis.<br><br>
The amendments implement the proposals that we promised in a press release on 20 December, but make all transitional adjustments in the transitional accounting period. There will be no need for the spreading envisaged in paragraph 12. If interest relates to accounting periods before the transitional accounting period but relief has not been obtained for it under the old rules, relief will be given when the interest is paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Are we now dealing with Government amendment No. 198, together with Government amendments Nos. 199 to 203?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am sorry. The confusion is my fault. I should have made it clear that with this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0609">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 691</span>
amendment we shall also consider Government amendments Nos. 199 to 203. I am afraid that I am suffering from amendment fatigue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Mr. Hogg. I have suffered from it for a long time, since we started dealing with these issues.<br><br>
I shall focus on amendments Nos. 200 and 203, which relate to paragraphs 12 and 15. The transitional provisions for the accrued income scheme are contained in paragraph 15. The provisions in the Bill give rise to several problems. The Government have attempted to overcome those problems, following representations by professional organisations, by introducing a new paragraph 12 in amendment No. 200. Amendment No. 203 applies to paragraph 15.<br><br>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that the transitional interaction with the accrued income scheme may give rise to difficulty even after the Bill has been amended as proposed. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Suppose a company which prepares accounts to 31 December annually purchases a security on 1 February 1996. Interest is payable on 30 November and 31 May. The position for the interest period to 31 May 1996 appears to be that the company is taxed under the normal rules of the new regime on the four months interest accruing during its actual ownership of the securities. However it is apparently also taxed, under the new paragraph 12(4) of schedule 14 on the one month interest which accrued before 1 January 1996. Locally one month accrued income scheme adjustment is required. This is not provided for by paragraph 15 either in its original form (which would have allowed relief for the full two months interest accrued at the time of purchase) or after amendment 203 (which prohibits the adjustment altogether).</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It is arguable that after the proposed substitution of the new paragraph 12, the interaction could be dealt with much more simply. It seems to be necessary only to amend the definition of 'pre-commencement late interest' in new paragraph 12(2) so as to exclude any interest which accrued before the company became a party to the loan relationship in question".</p></blockquote>
Presumably the Minister has a reason for not doing that. Paragraph 15(1) would then not be needed. What analysis has led the Minister and her advisers to supppose that that is not necessary?<br><br>
The Institute notes:
<br><blockquote><p>"If, however, that more radical approach is not adopted, a further amendment to paragraph 15 is required …to preserve symmetry with the new sub paragraph (1A) in the case of a security transferred without accrued interest."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point has been made to us by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, from which the hon. Gentleman learnt of its concern. Our amendments have substantially simplified the transitional rules with which I am sure he would agree. No doubt the legislation could be polished further, but we asked ourselves whether it works as it stands and the answer is that it does. We do not believe that further amendment is necessary. The purchaser will not receive first interest payment after acquisition and on an accruals basis will have no entitlement to the interest. Transitional accrued income scheme charge is still necessary and there is no element of double accounting.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 692</span>
We believe that we have covered all the issues that were raised. Perhaps that could have been done in a more polished way, but the provision does what is expected and ensures that interest is treated in the right and proper way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But it seems that the Institute of Chartered Accountants does not believe that the provision will achieve what the Government want to achieve. If the professional organisation representing the accountants who will have to deal with the matter believes that it does not achieve what the Government want to achieve, presumably it does not do what it is supposed to do.<br><br>
The Minister seems to have conceded that the provision lacks style and clarity. Having received the proposed amendments from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, is the Minister reluctant to accept our further amendments following the criticism that the Government have rightly received for tabling so many amendments to this section of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit rich to be accused of being frightened of tabling amendments. Not so long ago the accusation was the other way round and we were asked why on earth we were tabling amendments. We tabled amendments to ensure that the Bill works as we expect it to work, as practitioners want it to work and as business needs it to work. I can only repeat that the provision may not work in the most polished way possible, but it does work. I accept that concerns still exist and the Inland Revenue will write to the Institute of Chartered Accountants to allay its worries.<br><br>
I take the hon. Gentleman back to our previous sitting, when I said that we would ensure that open guidance is also available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Can we take it that if, having consulted further with the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Government accept that more polishing is needed, the possibility of our criticism will not make them reluctant to table amendments on Report? We all want the provision to work and if it requires polishing, that should be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a tendency for professional organisations to play, "tis, tisn't". If one organisation believes that something can be achieved in one way and another believes that it can be achieved in another way, there may be slight friction. Our objective is that the provision should work properly and we shall discuss how to ensure that the Institute of Chartered Accountants appreciates how we propose it should work. The Inland Revenue will write to the institute to allay its worries. If, for any reason, we believe that the provision does not work, we shall reconsider it, but we believe that it does work.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 258, line 17, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() To the extent that any deemed chargeable gain or deemed allowable loss falling to be brought into account under subparagraph (3) above includes any gain or loss deemed to accrue under section 116(10)(b) of the 1992 Act (qualifying corporate bonds acquired in a reorganisation etc.), that gain or loss shall be deemed to have accrued for the purposes of that sub-paragraph and (without prejudice to its being brought into account in accordance with that sub-paragraph) shall not be taken accrue again on the occurrence of the relevant event or any subsequent disposal of any asset.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 316, 235 to 237 and 247 to 250.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are technical and deal with the consequences of company reorganisations prior to 1 April 1996. They follow helpful representations and clarify the operation of the transitional rules where there has been an earlier company reorganisation involving the exchange of shares for debts. They remove a rough edge on transition from capital gains rules to mark-to-market accounting. They correct a technical defect on transition from the capital gains rules. They also—interestingly—remove two unintentional repeals: we have repealed the repeals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I refer to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Paragraph 8"—</p></blockquote>
which is covered by amendment No. 246—
<br><blockquote><p>"deals with the transitional provisions for chargeable assets held after commencement. The original paragraph 8 was deficient in that it did not exclude any gains which are being held over under section 116(10)"</p></blockquote>
of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The ICA continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Such gains would apparently still be brought into charge under section 116(10) when the asset is disposed of and thus would be charged to tax twice.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Amendment 246 overcomes this problem but it would appear that the word 'to' has been missed out of the amendment after the word 'accrue' in the penultimate line."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether the Minister was reluctant to deal with that omission—or would that have been an amendment too far?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we felt that we had to include "to", we would have included "to" too. What the amendments do is more serious, as the hon. Gentleman said. I can only reiterate that we have tabled the amendment in the way that we have because it covers the particular point in question, which is to ensure that the principle of dealing with capital gains tax continues. An item that is subject to capital gains tax rules at present, which comes into the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 694</span>
new rules, has a generality of provision—it is valued as the new rules start, but it is only taxed or relieved when it is disposed of.<br><br>
I have just received a note. It says that the omission of "to" is a misprint and can be taken as an editing point.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>", in accordance (where applicable) with paragraphs 9 and 10 of that Schedule,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 225 to 232.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with transitional rules for discounted securities. We were made aware that the value of discounted securities shown in the accounts of the lender and borrower may differ from the value used for tax purposes. That is not surprising since existing tax rules require discounted bonds to be valued in one specific way but there are a number of acceptable ways in which they can be valued for accounting purposes.<br><br>
The transitional rules also need to deal with securities sold during their life. Under existing rules any difference between the accounts and the tax value of such securities can be ignored, which can mean that the lender or borrower may have to pay too much or too little. At first we thought that we were dealing with a rough edge but it transpired that it was more serious than that. We amended the schedule accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a query about the wording of amendment No. 226 which seems to be in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 698</span>
error. Under paragraph (4A)(b) it is necessary for the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (4)(b) and (c) to be satisfied before (4A) will apply. It is not clear why the condition under sub-paragraph (4)(c) needs to be satisfied simply because a security falls within section 64 of the Finance Act 1993. Why should not subparagraph (4)(a) act in respect of it? Thus, paragraph (4A)(b) should perhaps read:
<br><blockquote><p>"the conditions specified in sub-paragraph (4)(b) above are satisfied in relation to that security".</p></blockquote>
The Economic Secretary may be able to deal with that now, but she may prefer to write to me in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Warwickshire said earlier that he had not tabled any amendments, yet he raises complex points without any notice. It would have been easy to table an amendment to leave out "and (c)", which would have signposted the hon. Gentleman's concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such is the way in which we have had to try to deal with problems that the particular point to which I referred was made known to me only one hour ago before the Committee's sitting. That is all the time that I have had to consider it, which is not enough to table an amendment. In any event, if the hon. Member for Beaconsfield had listened to what I said, I told the Economic Secretary that she could deal with my complex point through correspondence if she wished to do so. The hon. Gentleman's criticisms and the aggressive way in which he delivered his point are quite unjustified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must defend my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield who is a lovely pussy cat, not at all aggressive.

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Fourteenth schedule to the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to repeat my earlier apology to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. I did not table my three amendments to schedule 14 until yesterday [HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."] Well, that was better than the Opposition, who tabled none. I should have preferred to table them last week so that they would not have been starred and could have been debated. At least they are on the amendment paper and the Committee can see my proposals. The Opposition, however, have failed to table any amendments, regardless of whether they received notice of the issues one hour, one day or one week ago.<br><br>
The Association of British Insurers raised the points in the amendments. I do not expect my hon. Friend to reply to the substance of them now, but I should be grateful if she could do so in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's first point related to using 1 April as a general starting point for the new rules. We considered that proposal, but it would mean that companies would have to produce market valuations for purely tax purposes. That would be a formidable task and would involve the valuation of large amounts of unquoted debt. We did not think that companies would welcome that chore and we left the accruals basis as it stands—we did not take on board my hon. Friend's points. That approach ensures that companies move on to the new rules as quickly as possible.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's second point concerned transitional provisions for assets that were previously subject to the capital gains charge. Trading loan relationships relate in effect to dealers, and they can choose to spread the profit or loss over six years from 1 April or to delay until disposal. The reason for that option is that it would be difficult for dealers to track every loan relationship. I appreciate that my hon. Friend wants to extend that provision to assets that are not with dealers and currently come within the capital gains tax regime, and that he wants to give those assets the same option as dealers. That would, however, allow people to choose the best option for themselves, which would be fine for the individual, but would result in a considerable Exchequer loss. I hope that that explains why the Government do not want to adopt his amendments.</span></p>

Clause 144</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
FOTRA SECURITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come now to the tail end of the Bill before moving to the new clauses. I want to raise several points on the remaining clauses, none of which are subject to amendment.<br><br>
From observing the proceedings on Finance Bills over the years, I have noticed that the tendency to table endless probing amendments has emerged only relatively recently. It is often entirely appropriate simply to raise concerns in the clause stand part debate, when the Minister has been properly briefed and can deal with any point without the need for an amendment to focus his or her attention. The comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield therefore seemed strangely out of place, but I dare say that he will return to the fray in due course.<br><br>
Clause 144 amends the Treasury's powers to issue FOTRA gilts, which are free of tax to residents abroad. The clause and the schedule that it introduces appear to modify the Treasury's powers so that exemption can be applied to capital irrespective of where the beneficiary owning the gilts is domiciled. Is my understanding correct? Surely there must be some qualification, because if the person is not resident abroad, the gilt cannot be a FOTRA. In order for the gilt to be a FOTRA, the person has to be resident abroad.<br><br>
What powers are to be modified if I am wrong and the exemption is not to be applied to capital irrespective of domicile? Will the Economic Secretary say what the Treasury's powers are, what modifications are necessary, and why? There are certain exemptions to preserve the Treasury's position as regards anti-avoidance measures, but in the past few Finance Bills the Government have relaxed the rules relating to residence and made it easier for United Kingdom residents to become tax exiles, or semi-tax exiles. I want to make sure that the Bill does not introduce something that will enable people to receive benefits that up to now have been available only to people resident abroad.<br><br>
I shall be grateful if the Economic Secretary will explain the modifications for which she seeks approval. That will probably help the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, we need the clause because without it there will not be strips available in FOTRA. I found the hon. Gentleman's question about the domiciliary aspect rather strange, as the schedule seems to make the matter clear. FOTRA means free of tax for residents abroad, but only if certain conditions are satisfied—if the gilt says FOTRA on the front, and if the holder is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 702</span>
not domiciled in the United Kingdom. That is what the clause and the schedule describe. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's reading of the proposals, and there is no question of the Government changing the conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raised the matter because it was brought to my attention by a firm of accountants that specialises in giving advice to clients on such matters. If that firm thinks that the clause could be interpreted to mean that the Treasury's powers could be modified so that an exemption could be applied to capital irrespective of domicile, that is a matter worthy of pursuit.<br><br>
However, if I am wrong, will the Economic Secretary tell the Committee to what extent and in what way the Treasury's powers are modified by the clause and the schedule?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to the hon. Gentleman, one individual or advisory group has said that such an interpretation could be made. No doubt that is a sincere belief, but it is not shared by anyone else. The hon. Gentleman will know that it was in order to ensure a flourishing gilts strip market in this country that we sought to change the accounting rules in the first place. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that no other person or adviser, apart from the one that he mentioned, has offered the same interpretation of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The one specific legal person happens, in this instance, to be one of the country's six biggest accountancy firms, which is why I am worried. Perhaps the Economic Secretary can put my mind at ease by pointing to the paragraph in schedule 26 that makes it clear that the Treasury does not have the power to modify conditions relating to domicile. It would be helpful if she could do that. Can she also say what modifications are included?</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has the schedule in front of him, so he can read it for himself. He continues to raise the point that we have somehow modified or changed FOTRA so that it no longer applies only to people who are domiciled abroad. I can assure him that that is not the case. One of the primary conditions is that the holder is not domiciled in the United Kingdom—that is not a change, but the key point is that the status of existing FOTRA securities will not be changed either. The clause allows us to continue to ensure that we have a gilts strips market in which a considerable number of people who are not domiciled in the United Kingdom can participate.<br><br>
Subsection (1) of clause 144 extends the Treasury's power to issue securities on FOTRA terms. That ensures that where interest on FOTRA securities is presently exempt, the corresponding strips, which will themselves be FOTRA securities, can also be exempt. The rest of the clause and the schedule contain the detailed tax provisions. Thus, the provision simply extends to strips; it does not change the FOTRA rules themselves.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0615">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 703</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary sought to put my mind at ease by saying that there was a safeguard in schedule 26 which would prevent the Treasury from applying exemptions to capital, irrespective of the domicile. However, having confidently asserted that the schedule contained such a provision, she could not tell me exactly where in the schedule the words appear. She said that I had the schedule in front of me, so I must know. I have read through the schedule and I think that I am entitled, since the Minister asserted that that power is in the schedule, to press her on where it is. I am coming to the view that she does not know where it is—she said what appears on her brief—and that she cannot tell me where in the schedule it appears. I am worried because paragraph 1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Section 47 of the Taxes Act 1988"—</p></blockquote>
which deals with FOTRA securities—
<br><blockquote><p>"shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
It is superceded in part by clause 144, which is not, as the Minister said, the cornerstone of the gilts strips market. It is consequential on other provisions that are introduced to the strips market to the extent that it applies the strips/market provisions to the FOTRA regime.<br><br>
I have been advised by one of the country's six largest financial advisers—so it is not just an oddball adviser or someone who has come up with this off the top of his head—that in its view, the Treasury will now have powers to modify the rules in relation to domicile. I am therefore entitled to ask—as are my colleagues—where in the schedule the safeguard to which the Minister referred appears. She cannot make a general assertion that we must not worry because it appears in the schedule if she then cannot tell me where exactly it appears. She merely tells me to read it. If Ministers do not know what the Finance Bill says, how on earth are those who have to live their lives according to its provisions when it is enacted supposed to understand it? There is no point in the Minister sighing and looking distressed. She ought to know, if she tells the Committee that there is a safeguard in schedule 26, where it appears, but when I challenged her, she could not do that. Frankly, that is not a good way of proceeding.<br><br>
I asked a straightforward question. I would probably not have an objection to the measure, but given my information that the Treasury's power will be modified, where is the safeguard on domicile? I cannot be told. I then asked—a simple question, I thought—what modifications are provided for, but the Minister does not know that either. What is the point of us passing legislation when no Minister knows what it means? As I have been speaking, notes have been passing back and forth and perhaps that the Minister is better informed now than she was five minutes ago. I repeat my two simple questions: where in schedule 26 is the safeguard to which she referred, and what does clause 144 actually achieve? What modifications are available?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be going round in circles. I repeat that the issue before us is not the one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 704</span>
that the hon. Gentleman is discussing; the issue is that we want to ensure that we have a strips market and that FOTRA is part of it. The hon. Gentleman wants an assurance that we have not changed the domiciliary requirement—it still exists. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would care to read clause 144, where that aspect is mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where in clause 144?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has had a long time to read the Bill. If he starts reading at clause 144(1), the safeguard will hit him in the face after a very few lines. I suggest that he has a look.<br><br>
The provisions ensure that FOTRA works. We could have amended the existing FOTRA legislation to cope with the new world, but it was in need of updating so we have repealed it in schedule 26 and rewritten it. To run through the issue in brief, FOTRA means free of tax, but only if certain conditions are satisfied—if the gilt says FOTRA on the front and the holder is not domiciled in the United Kingdom. The gilt is not free of tax in respect of certain anti-avoidance provisions. In effect, the gilt will be free of tax in the future—as it is at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least it seems that the Minister was not referring to the schedule. The safeguard seems to be in clause 144(1), which is worth reading. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The modifications which, under section 60 of the Finance Act 1940, may be made —shall include a modification by virtue of which the tax exemption contained in any condition of the issue"—</p></blockquote>
of the strips, I assume—
<br><blockquote><p>"applies, as respects capital, irrespective of where the person with the beneficial ownership of the securities is domiciled."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps that led my informant to suggest that the Government were modifying the rules so that the exemption could be applied irrespective of where the person who beneficially owns the gilt is domiciled. A plain reading of clause 144(1) appears to include the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"irrespective of where the person with the beneficial ownership of the securities is domiciled."</p></blockquote>
I might have got it all terribly wrong, as might my adviser, but does the Economic Secretary agree that those are the words in the subsection and that they tend to suggest that that is the modification in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is not much point in my answering the same questions over and over again. The answer is exactly the same now as it was when the hon. Gentleman asked the question in the first instance. He asked whether FOTRA applied only to people who are not domiciled in the United Kingdom and the answer is that it does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to labour the point, but that is why Committees exist, with or without amendments. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not care whether the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0616">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 705</span>
Minister is tired; it is only 5 o'clock in the afternoon. I am entitled to ask about the clause, which contains the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"irrespective of where the person with the beneficial ownership of the securities is domiciled."</p></blockquote>
Although it is absurd, given what FOTRAs are, that would seem to include a person who is domiciled in the United Kingdom. That is the only new way in which people could qualify for a FOTRA benefit—they would have had to be domiciled outside the United Kingdom prior to the passing of the clause.<br><br>
I repeat that my informant was not some oddball adviser, but a reputable firm—one of the six largest in the country. It seemed to think that the Treasury's powers would be modified and I understand why it thinks that. I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for drawing my attention to the fact that the explanation is in clause 144(1) and not in the schedule as she previously thought. If the Minister is categorically assuring me that no one who is domiciled in the United Kingdom could benefit from the provision, one is bound to ask why on earth clause 144(1) is framed in such a way. It seems very strange. In the interests of clarity, it would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could tell us what she has just been told.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, it was the hon. Gentleman who referred to the schedule, not I. In reply to his question, I told him to read the schedule. If he would care to turn back to clause 144 he will see that it also relates to the Finance Act 1931. That, in its turn, confines relief to non-domiciled holders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dare say it does: I plead guilty to not being fully familiar with the Finance Act 1931—[Horn. MEMBERS: "Shame."] Conservative Members shout, "Shame": I challenge any of them to stand up and tell me what is in it. I refer, of course, to the No. 2 Act, not the No. 1 Act, with which I am sure we are all familiar.<br><br>
Even if we take the Minister's remarks at face value, it means that the clause provides that the exemption specified in section 32 of the 1931 Act
<br><blockquote><p>"shall include a modification by virtue of which the tax exemption contained in any condition of the issue applies, as respects capital, irrespective of where the person with the beneficial ownership …is domiciled."</p></blockquote>
It is possible that in the 1931 Act it was anticipated that people could be domiciled in parts of the world where the tax treatment was different. I do not know whether it included non-Commonwealth countries or Commonwealth countries. I am entitled to ask the question, because the last thing that we want is for someone to rely on that and seek to gain benefits while domiciled in this country which were never intended to be given to people other than those domiciled outside this country.<br><br>
That raises a fundamental point about clarity in legislation. I am bound to say that the clause is not clear, so much so that it has taken us a long time to get the Minister to tell us where we can find the safeguards to which I referred. On a plain reading of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 706</span>
the clause, I am encouraged to believe that the interpretation of the people who advised me on this matter was not misplaced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only suggest that the people who advised the hon. Gentleman should get in contact with the Inland Revenue. I have already exlplained why the clause was written in that way. Those who draft clauses do not spuriously pick out of the air an Act here and a word there and jumble them together: they draft clauses to achieve the consequential effect that we want.<br><br>
The consequential effect of this clause relates to FOTRA and is to ensure that the same conditions on domicile apply in the future as in the past. That is what the people who have drafted the legislation and who have connected one part to another have sought to achieve. If the hon. Gentleman's advisers are taking issue with the way in which the clause is written, it is far better for them to get in touch with the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
We consider that the clause and the schedule do what I said they do. As with so many of the issues that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire raised earlier, one person or group may have drafted a clause differently. The question is whether it does the job; the answer is that it does what I said it does. I can only extend my offer to the hon. Gentleman that his advisers speak to the Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That attitude would be greeted with delight by the legal profession. The Economic Secretary may be invited to address the Law Society's annual dinner, because that attitude creates work for lawyers. We ought not to be in the business of creating work for lawyers. We should seek to pass legislation whose terms are clear, so that any room for manoeuvre and any opportunity to engage in correspondence with the Inland Revenue are kept to a minimum. The Government should not pass legislation when we do not have a clue what it means, and are told that if anyone wants to write in about it they will gladly deal with the correspondence. That is not a satisfactory way of proceeding. I almost have sympathy with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.<br><br>
One function of tabling amendments is to ensure that the Minister is fully focused on the issue. I had hoped that as the clause and schedule were short we could get a precise explanation of them from the Minister, but we have spent 15 minutes—round the course as she rightly said—trying to extract that from her.<br><br>
I am not fully convinced and my advisers may have to engage in correspondence on the matter. I fear that we are creating work for accountants and lawyers—which is not the purpose of the Committee.</span></p>

TRANSFERS ON DEATH UNDER THE ACCRUED INCOME SCHEME</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 103, leave out line 9 and add
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) In Section 715 of that Act, wherever the figure £5,000 occures, substitute the figure £200,000.</p></blockquote>
This simple amendment seeks to ease the burden on small investors in gilts and loan stock. Members of the Committee are probably familiar with the accrued income scheme, which was introduced in the Finance Act 1985, under sections 73 to 77 and the detailed provisions in schedule 23. That legislation has now been subsumed into the Taxes Act 1988. Those who are familiar with the accrued income scheme legislation will know that those provisions are complex. They were originally enacted to circumvent a process known as bond washing, an activity that insurance companies in particular undertook in the early to mid-1980s whereby they brought gilt and loan stocks, allowed the interest to accrue on those instruments and then sold them, before the interest was payable so that they would generate capital gains which, if in the form of gilt-edged securities, were free of income tax. Major insurance companies therefore sought to avoid income tax on the interest arising and the provisions introduced in the Finance Act 1985 were a proper attempt to mitigate large-scale tax avoidance.<br><br>
The provisions are so complex that they probably defeat not only some hon. Members, but many tax advisers and Revenue officials around the country. Many professional people will have had great difficulty in unravelling them to understand what they mean for their taxpaying clients. The provisions contain sections on the meaning of "settlement day", how to deal with variable interest rates and how new issues impact on the accrued income scheme; also, if gilts or loan stock are converted into a different form of security, that is deemed to be a transfer and gives rise to a tax charge under the accrued income legislation.<br><br>
Fortunately, under the gilts and bonds legislation that we have been dealing with, the accrued income scheme for companies has effectively disappeared, and has been replaced by the new gilts and bonds legislation, which affects the companies that may have been large-scale avoiders of the tax. So now it is only individuals who have to battle with the accrued income scheme. My amendment allows for an increase in the exemption limit for small investors who have invested in gilt-edged securities and similar stock. The 1985 Act provides an exemption limit for a saver with £5,000 worth of such investments. An investment of that size generates approximately £250 of interest income in a year, so such an investor is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 708</span>
very small investor. It was decided when that Act was passed that such small investors should not be caught by the provisions, which might force them to recompute their interest earnings according to the accrued income scheme.<br><br>
With new bonds and gilts legislation coming in for companies and the move to self-assessment imminent, it might be worth reviewing the exemption limit. I have suggested that it should be reviewed upwards to £200,000. An investor at that level might have an income of £10,000, which is not a sizeable level of income. Such an investor would probably not be a sophisticated investor. Members of the Committee probably have many widowed or elderly constituents with small amounts of gilt-edged stocks worth more than £5,000 who now face being assessed for tax under the accrued income scheme, particularly through self-assessment. If such small investors have transactions in those securities, they will be required to undertake complex calculations under the accrued income scheme to complete their self-assessment for taxation. The Committee ought to reconsider the level of exemption because it catches too many small investors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause abolishes the accrued income scheme charge on death. That is one step along the road which my hon. Friend wants us to tread. He has correctly outlined the background to the accrued income scheme and the reasons and thinking behind its introduction. The scheme exists primarily to prevent bond washing. My hon. Friend explained clearly how that works. It is reasonable to ask whether the provisions are still relevant. The issue deserves a proper hearing and I shall try to do my hon. Friend justice.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's first point was about complexity. He is correct to say that the accrued income scheme is so complex that modest investors in securities cannot understand it. There is scope to improve current legislation. It could be re-written in simple language, along the lines foreshadowed in the Revenue's report on simplification. I am sure that all hon. Members want to follow that practice for tax legislation in general, irrespective of the consequences.<br><br>
I asked for some calculations on the costs involved in the amendment. Those costs would be substantial. With a £200,000 limit, as proposed in the amendment, the income saved from tax by bond washing and holding gilts just under the limit with a yield of 8 per cent. would be approximately £16,000 a year. For a top rate taxpayer, that would give a tax saving of nearly £6,500, which is a significant sum and an attractive option that people would choose. Even if a clear majority of investors resisted temptation, the cost could be as high as £200 million a year. The cost could be considerably higher than that, because the phrase that I used was "if a clear majority of investors resisted temptation".<br><br>
The issue was another strand: that it might bring the tax system in respect of tax avoidance into question because, in effect, we would be condoning an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0618">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 709</span>
avoidance that we had previously decided must be stopped. For those reasons, I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment. I understand the spirit in which he raised this matter and, as I said earlier, it is right that it should be debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those comments. In calculating the cost, the Inland Revenue seems to have assumed that small investors actively engage in bond washing. That is hardly a realistic assumption. The burden of cost on very small investors engaging in those transactions is a deterrent. When talking about holders of gilts in excess of £5,000, we are not, quite frankly, talking about sophisticated investors. The figure that I came up with was the figure that the Revenue originally suggested when it was thinking of applying gilts and bonds legislation to individuals. The Revenue took the view that sophisticated investors were those who held more than £200,000-worth of gilts.<br><br>
I should like to hear more from the Minister about the possibility of raising the level above £5,000—a level that was set some 10 years ago. We are dealing with small investors who are now faced with complex provisions, with which they will be obliged to cope under self-assessment.<br><br>
I listened to the Minister's remarks about simplification of the bond-washing provisions. We all live in hope of simplification, but a close study of the bond-washing provisions and their detail leads one to a degree of scepticism as to the extent to which they can realistically be simplified while remaining on the statute book.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend think about raising the limit above £5,000? That would prevent many small, often elderly, investors from being caught up in detailed provisions and encountering problems with self-assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the point of costs, our figures assumed that most small investors do not bond wash. We know that, as does my hon. Friend. In many respects, it is the complexity of the matter—in addition to ignorance of the process—that results in the occurrence of bond washing.<br><br>
The £5,000 is a de minimis level that was set for the right reasons. My hon. Friend asks whether that level might be increased a bit. The answer to that question is that we need to simplify the scheme. The possibility of increasing the limit should be examined if we do so. In my opening remarks, I explained that the scheme is a candidate for clear thinking in relation to the writing of legislation. I undertake to take up the points that my hon. Friend raised and to carry out a proper review of his specific concerns.</span></p>

<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions for the Minister. Subsections (2), (4) and (5) of the clause will give the Treasury the power to make further regulations. The regulations are extensive: they will impose a charge in relation to income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and stamp duty—you name it, it is in the clause. We should of course be careful about giving a Secretary of State the power to raise taxes without making reference to primary legislation, although the authority in the Bill is clearly derived.<br><br>
As a matter of principle, it is important for the Minister to say precisely how she expects the power to be used over the next 12 months; her explanation will also be useful. When can we expect to see such regulations?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0619">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 711</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman raised that matter. Wide powers are contained in the clause, and I have asked the same questions as the hon. Gentleman. My answer will take a little time.<br><br>
The issue relates to the meaning of the word "strip" and the use of the word "stock" in legislation. A wide variety of legislation may need consequential amendment to accommodate the existence of strips. Strips will not be stock in the legal sense of having both interest and principal. We have endeavoured to identify all the miscellaneous Acts that will need to be amended. A huge number of Acts uses the word "stock". For example, the Mental Health Act 1984 and the Trustee Investments Act 1961 both refer to the issue of Government stock. Much of the legislation may not require amendment, or may require only minor amendment. As a consequence, it is impossible at this stage, to be sure about exactly what reforms are needed in every case.<br><br>
Some of the Acts refer to stock for reasons of security—for example, to protect the individuals whom that Act covers. A strip is more volatile than conventional stock. We must ensure that we do not inadvertently add strip into a situation and make volatile an investment that is controlled in order to protect individuals. We have therefore chosen a route whereby the Treasury consults markets and relevant bodies to ensure accuracy. We continue to ensure that all the Acts that use the word "stock" are thoroughly checked to establish whether "strip" is meant to be included.<br><br>
It was potentially possible for us to give the Committee a list of the Acts to which the change needs to be made. If we had done so, however, we might have omitted legislation. A power is therefore being taken to get the matter right.<br><br>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about the use of the phrase "impose a charge" when that relates to inheritance tax, for example, because it is possible that any regulations needed could have an incidental effect. That is why the phrase has been included. We cannot say that it would have an incidental effect, but the power is widely drawn for the reasons that I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a further question which perhaps the Economic Secretary would answer. Having identified some of the problems, is the Treasury in a position to let us know when we can expect to start seeing the regulations? It would be helpful to know that.<br><br>
I understand the Minister's point—that this is consequential legislation because there are so many statutes. If the clause is simply designed to tidy up matters, that is acceptable, but I am anxious to ensure that the Government are not in the business of acquiring powers to impose tax without reference to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 712</span>
primary legislation. I do not think that she stood under the Conservative flag in 1979, but she will recall that that Government were elected on a commitment to roll back the power of the state, among other things. Clause 187 shows that the state has substantial powers, and such powers should be granted very carefully.<br><br>
It would be helpful if the hon. Lady would let us know when we can expect to see the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In 1979 I was running an engineering company in Rotherham, so I was not taking part in politics.<br><br>
We are hoping to consult on the new regulations in the autumn this year. We need to be ready for the opening of the new strips market at the beginning of next year, so we shall use the power and consult on the new regulations accordingly. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the reason for the width of the power is as I described. I accept that it is a wide power. If it had been drawn more narrowly, we could have missed the sort of circumstances that we do not wish to miss—proper protection of individuals who are protected under a variety of Acts. Its only purpose is that which I have described.</span></p>
