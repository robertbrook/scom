	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i>: No. 81, in page 166, leave out lines 21 and 22.—[	<i>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 82.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Press release 5/96 says that an amendment is required to cover the possibility of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 still being in force by the time the landfill tax is implemented. That is a rather odd explanation for an amendment, and I have a sneaking feeling that it has more to do with padding out the Bill than improving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 81 strikes out sub-paragraph (6) (a) on page 166 of the Bill. I would like to know why that sub-paragraph has to be struck out. Amendment No. 82 inserts a new sub-paragraph (7). As far as I can see the only difference is the word "computer", so why is it necessary? Does the Minister know whether the Civil Evidence Act 1968 is likely to be amended by this Parliament? If he does know, why did he not just say so, instead of referring to the possibility of it still being in force? If he does know, when can we expect such an amendment to come before Parliament? If he cannot answer any of those questions, will he explain why he is wasting the Committee's time by tabling amendments that appear to do nothing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the provisions of paragraph 2 of schedule 4 of the Bill take account of the Civil Evidence Act 1995, particularly with regard to the admissibility of computer evidence in civil proceedings in England and Wales. The amendments are necessary to align these provisions with the 1995 Act when it is enacted. Although we cannot take that for granted, it is reasonable to anticipate its enactment. They will allow computer documents to be admissible under the Civil Evidence Act 1968 until the 1995 Act is enacted, so the amendments are required in any eventuality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he does not know but he probably thinks so and just in case he has tabled some amendments. He has still not said why it is necessary to strike out sub-paragraph (6) (a) as proposed in amendment No. 81.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because when the Civil Evidence Act 1995 comes into force, that subparagraph will no longer be necessary. The 1995 Act will come into force by order in due course, and it is sufficient that the Committee should anticipate that the Act has been passed where it is the Government's intention to bring it into force. It would be silly for us to keep on the statute book provisions that will no longer be required. That is why that sub-paragraph should be struck out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister still has not told us when it comes into force and why the amendments are therefore necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Lady a date, but I can assure her that the Government intend to bring it into force; it is therefore reasonable for us to anticipate it happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made</i>: No. 82, in page 166, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) In the case of civil proceedings in England and Wales to which sections 5 and 6 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 apply, a statement contained in a document produced by a computer shall not be admissible in evidence by virtue of sub-paragraph (4) above except in accordance with those sections.". [	<i>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 170, leave out lines 30 to 34 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"11. Tax due from any person shall be recovered as a debt due to the Crown.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 102, in page 170, leave out lines 32 to 34.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 102 is tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) who I am sure will want to take part in the debate. The two amendments have an identical objective and remove identical parts from the Bill. They refer to the provisions to make company directors jointly and severally liable for the landfill tax due from the company. Amendment No. 34 seeks to remove that joint and several liability. The Government propose to make company directors personally liable for the payment of the new environment tax and that is widely seen as an unprecedented attack on limited company liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise has said that the clause is necessary to protect Government revenue. In the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on 6 February 1996, a source referred to as "Customs" said that the clause was a
	<br><blockquote><p>"revenue protection measure and a way of making sure the tax is paid."</p></blockquote>
The Environmental Services Association, which represents 70 per cent. of the waste disposal industry, said that the proposal was draconian and threatened directors' personal wealth—a new form of indirect tax on personal wealth, perhaps. Mr. Michael Averill, chief executive of the Shanks and McEwan Group,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
which has an estimated liability under the new tax of about £50 million a year, said
	<br><blockquote><p>"This makes a nonsense of limited liability. The evasion of this tax is a criminal offence and that is sufficient sanction."</p></blockquote>
Mr. John Whiting, head of personal tax at Price Waterhouse, said that it was a new and revolutionary power and that the tax pierces the "famed veil of incorporation". He said that it was accepted that such liability could apply if directors had been honest, but that is already covered under current VAT legislation. Those powers contrast starkly with the VAT legislation, which applies a test of dishonesty. That is circumvented by the proposals. As drafted, paragraph 11 will catch innocent company directors but not others who have developed an evasion scheme or committed a fraud. It will also catch directors of companies that become insolvent, even though the director is not at fault. The amounts involved are more than likely to bankrupt the person involved. As the Minister said in a previous debate, about 1,400 companies will be involved in the collection of the tax, which is estimated to amount to £450 million. The sums of money are substantial and are now to be levied against individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for this new precedent. The Revenue is protected by other powers. Given the concern expressed by the Paymaster General in the debate on Tuesday, I am sure that he will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady said, amendment No. 102 would have much the same effect as amendment No. 34. The matter was discussed briefly on Tuesday evening in response to a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington). My hon. Friend and I are worried about this provision, which the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) said was unprecedented. I think that that is not so and that it is based on gaming legislation, but I agree that it is unnecessary and goes too far, wrongly penalising directors who have behaved honestly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If possible, we should model the provision on the VAT legislation. The Minister responded sympathetically on Tuesday to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, so I hope that he will agree that the amendment will make it possible later to insert provisions similar to those in the VAT legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) said in support of the amendment. The landfill tax is a new fiscal measure, and we need to know whether the Government intend to set a precedent with it. It is the only new tax provision in the Bill, and the retention of the provisions in paragraph 11 of schedule 4 as drafted could be interpreted to mean that company directors would be liable if they failed to deliver on any further environmental taxes considered by the Government. I support the arguments of both my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to reinforce the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. I suspect that we are knocking on an open door in this instance, given the comments of my hon. Friend the Paymaster General on Tuesday afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is precedent for examining the limited liability protection of directors of gambling companies, but the special circumstances surrounding such companies do not apply to companies engaged in landfill operations. As a matter of principle, as well as of practice, it would be undesirable to weaken the protection given to directors by the legal framework of a limited liability company. Therefore, I urge my hon. Friend to consider whether there is another way of achieving the objectives of the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, hope that the Minister will accept Labour's constructively worded and sensible amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directors of companies who are covered by the Act are not simply landfill operators who operate only in that specialised area. British Steel has a licence under the Act and it may come as a surprise to the directors of British Steel and to those of other mainstream companies, for whom landfill waste disposal operations are only a minor aspect of their activities, to find that they are now personally liable. Indeed, the hon. Member for Pudsey (Sir G. Shaw), in the best pre-Nolan spirit of the Conservative party, is a handsomely remunerated director of British Steel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that, were it drawn to the hon. Gentleman's attention that he might find himself personally liable he, too, would want to support amendment No. 34 which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South and which is supported by the hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for Fulham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can put the hon. Gentleman right on one point—my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey is not at risk because the tax is due from landfill operators. Although he is a man of many parts, he is not a landfill operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: British Steel will have to apply for one of the licences. Does the Minister understand that? British Steel will be covered by the new legislation. It already has a waste disposal licence and it will therefore be one of the 1,400 companies whose directors will, I fear, be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. If my hon. Friend is a member of a company that owns a licensed landfill site, the hon. Gentleman is quite right to draw my attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 34 and 102 draw the attention of members of the Committee to the point about joint and several liability and have been tabled to draw out of me whether a unique power has been sought and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
whether it is required in the circumstances. It is not unique, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beasonsfield spotted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a power is used in the betting and gaming field, which has certain similarities with the tax that we are considering. A landfill site provides services, not goods, and in some cases will therefore have little by way of assets as compared with other businesses. If money has to be recovered in a case of insolvency, there may be few assets concerned other than a large hole in the ground with a lot of rubbish in it. The thinking behind the original clause was that it might be necessary to go behind the veil of incorporation and make the directors responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the landfill tax due may represent a high percentage of the total value of a transaction. One can imagine an old landfill site charging only £1 a tonne for inactive waste, in which case the tax of £2 a tonne is 200 per cent. of the original charge. A much higher proportion of the tax could therefore be at risk than is the case with taxes such as VAT. For all those reasons, the Bill was drafted as it is. However, I am happy to accept the suggestions that are put to me and have already indicated my desire to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the Opposition's amendment because it is technically deficient. In addition to proposing the deletion of sub-paragraph (2), it aims to amend sub-paragraph (1) be adding:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tax due from any person shall be recovered"</p></blockquote>
by the Crown, instead of its being "recoverable". That is a significant distinction because had the landfill operator disappeared or had no means to pay the tax, customs would be in breach of the law if its failed to recover the amount due. That is why the legislation uses the word "recoverable". There is a duty elsewhere in the Bill to seek recovery of any amounts due. I cannot accept an amendment that would mean that, in certain cases, customs would be in breach of the law if it failed to recover all the amounts due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, however, happy to accept the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. It aims to achieve exactly the same thing, but does not suffer from the same defect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Paymaster General could give us the case law for the definition of "recover" and "recoverable" and would explain why they are different in law. Or is the problem just that we tabled one amendment and the Paymaster General's hon. Friend tabled another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to weary the Committee. I have given the distinction, which is valid and understood by my right hon. and hon. Friends. I will not repeat the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our amendment does the same thing as that of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, but the Minister does not have the good grace to accept it. I do not want to delay the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendments made</i>: No. 102, in page 170, leave out lines 32 to 34.—[	<i>Mr. Tim Smith.</i>]</p>
	<p>No. 83, in page 177, line 42, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>", or otherwise became aware of,".—[	<i>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 181, line 26, leave out from "be" to second "rate" in line 29 and insert "calculated at a penalty".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 27 imposes a separate interest charge on the following: tax shown on returns but not paid by the due date, running from the due date to the payment date; tax assessed because a return has not been made, running from the due date to payment date; other tax assessed, running from the date of notification of assessment or other dates specified by customs to payment date; and penalties assessed running from the date of notification of the assessment or other date specified by customs to payment date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, customs will calculate interest to the date of assessment included on the assessment and give a date on the assessment by which the whole amount must be paid if a further interest charge is to be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interest rate is a penalty rate equal to the rate in clause 183, a new provision for setting the rate of interest for indirect tax purposes, plus 10 per cent., which is compounded monthly. The interest is not deductible in computing income or profits for direct purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 28, however, allows full mitigation of the penalty interest by customs or a tribunal. That is a departure from previous taxes, replacing the default surcharge regime with a penalty interest rate. Compound interest at 10 per cent. over the standard rate could rapidly amount to a large sum. At the current normal interest rate of 7 per cent., after three years, the penalty interest could be 66 per cent. of the tax—presumably the reason for joint and several liability. That is somewhat excessive and amendment No. 35 would counter that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The paragraph provides for interest to be charged at a penalty rate on unpaid tax, interest and penalties. It provides a suitable penalty for those who do not pay their tax debts on time. I should remind the Committee that this money has been collected by operators from their customers: we are asking for it to be paid on to Customs and Excise. Failure to comply will incur a penalty. The interest will run from the day on which the debt is established until the day before it is paid. Once the amount of tax, interest or penalty due to customs has been established, it should be paid on time. The interest penalty specified is set at 10 percentage points higher than interest charged under separate paragraph 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would defeat the object of the penalty. It makes only about 1.5 per cent. difference in the interest rate but it creates an odd situation whereby the original interest penalty imposed does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
accumulate a further interest penalty. The hon. Lady was rather misleading in suggesting that a penalty rate of interest is necessarily either an unwelcome departure or unfair. Customs has received criticisms from businesses that the alternative system of default surcharge does not reflect the time during which the debt is outstanding. Under that alternative system, a debt unpaid for one month receives the same penalty as a debt that remains unpaid for a year. Under the schedule, however, the penalty is directly proportionate to the time that a debt remains unpaid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification of why particular decisions have been taken. Paragraph 36 allows customs to publish the landfill tax register, which gives names, addresses and registrations. In the case of a group, it includes the names of other group members. That will be done without charge, but no reason has been given for the publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision raises the possibility of commercially confidential information being published, which is inconsistent with a consultation document issued in August 1995 in respect of the possible publication of the VAT register. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is open-minded about this proposal. It recognises that a business register might bring benefits to businesses, particularly those providing business information, assessing credit-worthiness, or underwriting credit risk. On the other hand, the Government accepts that some businesses might have reservations about allowing their details to be released".</p></blockquote>
Why have the Government made up their mind that the register in respect of landfill tax can be published, but not the VAT register? What types of information do the Government envisage being included in the register? Why do the Government believe that publication will not breach the confidentiality of the businesses involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I comment on the question of the publication of the register?

landfill register. In his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), the Minister showed that he was not aware that British Steel would be registerable, because it owns land on which it disposes some of its waste products, as do many of the industrial concerns which have made representations to us. They will have to be registered under the provisions relating to the landfill tax. I am sure that many companies, both small and large, are currently unaware that they will be registerable under the landfill tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the publication of register, and hence the publication of companies' details, is to be a consequence of the Bill, not only are those companies not aware that they will be required to be on the register, but they are not aware of the implications of being on the register—namely, the possible disclosure of commercially confidential information about their activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the paragraph is to enable landfill customers to know whether the operator to whom they pay money is registered for landfill tax.

The provision is unique in allowing customs to offset VAT repayments due against landfill tax liabilities. A VAT repayment due to an insolvent person could be set against pre-insolvency liabilities. By deleting the paragraph, the amendment would prevent the Crown from gaining an unfair advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 87 and 88 allow for regulations to be made on setting off such debts. The Crown is given an unfair preference, because taxpayers do not have the same powers or rights over money owed to them by the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the power necessary and how will those collecting the landfill tax within Customs and Excise know what other taxes are outstanding? How will information be collected and from whom? Will there be a clearing house? How will the set-off be applied for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
The Government must make clear how the preference being given to the Crown will operate. We do not believe that the Crown needs such an advantage, but we shall be interested to hear what the Paymaster General has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is consistent with the common law, under which customs already has the right to set off amounts owed to a business against any amounts owed by the business, regardless of the tax or duty concerned. That is why I reject the amendment.

I draw the Committee's attention to the Government amendments, which provide for regulations allowing the set-off to be made automatically if a taxpayer is a net debtor to customs. A similar provision exists for net creditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 45 allows the payment due under contract for landfill disposal to be varied to take account of changes in the tax chargeable, including the imposition or removal of the tax. The payments may be adjusted to the amount that it can reasonably be expected the parties would have agreed, unless the contract provides otherwise.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
Paragraph 46 allows rental agreements made before 29 November, 1994, when the landfill tax was announced, under which the rent is computed by reference to turnover, to ignore the tax in calculating turnover, if it can reasonably be expected that that is what the parties would have done had they known of the tax. Those provisions are inconsistent with business note 114/95, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there will be a provision enabling contracts which were negotiated before the introduction of the tax to be varied to take account of its introduction, so that an additional sum, up to the amount of the landfill tax payable, can be added to the contract price previously agreed between the two parties."</p></blockquote>
Those two paragraphs are imprecise and are likely to lead to unnecessary negotiations and, perhaps, to litigation. A simple provision allowing the tax to be imposed, unless the contract explicitly states otherwise, would be a much better approach. Suitable precedents exist in VAT legislation and the insurance premium tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 would have that effect and enable contract negotiations to take account of the tax imposed. If that is not allowed to happen, the connection between the polluter pays and previously negotiated contracts will be broken. I am sure that is not the intention of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister to reply to the important point made today in 	<i>The Times</i> by Richard Watson, a senior VAT partner at Price Waterhouse? I am sure that the Minister will have read 	<i>The Times</i> from cover to cover this morning, as do most hon. Members. Mr. Watson draws attention to what he calls "its diabolical details" and refers to this clause which the amendment attempts to improve. He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The overall effect seems to be that both parties can argue about what they would have done had landfill tax been introduced at a time when neither of them actually knew anything about its existence!"</p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friend said, if the Government are not prepared to accept this sensible amendment, we shall open the way to disputes and litigation and will turn a silk purse back into a pig's ear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether something is diabolical often depends on one's standpoint. What is good for a waste producer may not be so good for a landfill site operator, and vice versa. The schedule proposes to strike a balance between the two. Provision is needed to vary contracts when a new tax is introduced, but it is desirable in general that the tax should be passed back up the waste chain, even when that means overriding existing contracts. Otherwise, the site operator would have to bear the entire amount of extra tax without an opportunity of passing it back to the waste producer if there was a pre-existing contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drafting the provision we wanted to include the concept of what could reasonably be expected to be done if the tax had been anticipated and to cover a broad category of eventualities. There is some force in the sentiments expressed, but a waste producer might
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
have entered into a contract with a waste transporter to have his waste taken away on the understanding that it would be not landfill but would be recycled. If the transporter subsequently decided that it would not be recycled but would be landfill, would it be right that the extra cost of landfilling should be passed back up the chain to the waste producer when he clearly intended at the time of signing the contract with the transporter that it would not be landfill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendments, that extra cost would automatically pass back up the chain from the site operator to the transporter to the waste producer, in contradiction of what I think was the intention. The example is slightly esoteric and I am not aware of the extent of the problem in practice. If it helps the Committee, I am willing to make further and better inquiries to discover from trade interests the extent of the problem, the number of pre-existing contracts and so on. The hon. Lady was a little wounded that I could not accept her defective amendment earlier and I hope that this evens the score. I accept the hon. Lady's argument, but that is not a pledge because I must consult further with the industry. I, too, have some misgivings about opening contracts to what might reasonably have been foreseen because that would give additional work to lawyers, which is not the purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must be sterner with the hon. Lady's other amendment on the alteration of rental contracts because it would apply even after the tax was announced. It is fair to expect that those who made contractual arrangements after the 1994 Budget announcement did so in the knowledge that a tax would come into effect. For us to override that now would be wrong because it would be an interference in leases freely made. Amendment No. 39 is in a different category. I hope that the Committee agrees that it should be rejected, and that we should further consider the thoughts behind amendment No. 38.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the Paymaster General would give us an idea of how long it will take to consider the principle in amendment No. 38.

If he will, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. If he does not do so, we shall return to the matter at a later stage. I shall reconsider amendment No. 39 in view of his comments.

	<br><blockquote><p>(6) In subsection (5) above 'construction operations' has the meaning assigned to it by the Taxes Act 1988, section 567.".</p></blockquote>
We recently discussed what would happen to contracts that were signed before 29 November 1994, and it was agreed that something needed to be done so that tax could be charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Building Employers Confederation is worried about what will happen further down the line. The relevant tax may be passed on to a building employer who may have signed a construction contract before 29 November 1994 and be unable to pass the tax on to the customer. The amendment would solve that problem, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will look on it favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point, although I am not aware of the scale of the problem in practice. I must put to my hon. Friend the counterpoint that if the amendment were accepted it would be unfair to those landfill site operators who entered into a contract with a construction company before they knew about the landfill tax. The contract would not pass the tax on to the construction company. In general, the construction company would be in a better position to bear the extra tax—which would be a very small percentage of the overall contract—than the site operator, who would otherwise have to bear the entire charge. My hon. Friend should bear in mind the other side of the argument. As I said earlier, one's view of the proposals depends on where one stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the strength of my right hon. Friend's argument. The amendment would leave the landfill site operator to pay the tax from his own resources, which would be unreasonable. I suppose that the alternative is to try to re-open the contract between the construction company and its customer, but that is rather remote from the tax and I am not sure that that is the right approach either. I should like to give the matter further thought. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two additional points that I should like to make. First, this is an opportunity to tell the Committee that the Government intend to table an amendment to paragraph 14 of the schedule on Report to limit the period during which any repayment of overpaid tax can be claimed to six years from the date of overpayment. The only time limit for claims in the Bill is that they must be made within six years of the date the mistake was discovered. There is no limit on how far back claims can be made. That conflicts with the principle of legal certainty and is not justified. The amendment will bring the provision for repayment of overpaid tax into line with the six-year time limit in paragraph 33 for commissioners' assessments for underpayment of tax.

The second point is to announce that although customs reserves the right to collect duty that is properly due, the tax is new, as Opposition Members have made clear, and in deciding whether to impose penalties and and interest, customs will take a sympathetic view of genuine errors made as a result of unfamiliarity with or misunderstanding of the tax during the first year of its operation. That is despite the fact that customs will be arranging to visit all registerable operators in advance of the introduction of the tax to answer operators' queries. Similar arrangements were made during the introduction of insurance premium tax and air passenger duty. It is right to make such arrangements for this tax. Operators will not be penalised for a first default in the first year unless it is thought that deliberate evasion or manipulation is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now return to volume I and clause 53 which deals with taxable disposals. Amendment No. 101 is a considerable improvement on amendment No. 43, which was gobbledegook. I suggest that the Committee ignores new clause 4 because that was intended to address the British Alcan problem, which we dealt with earlier. The group is reduced to a manageable number of three—amendment No. 44, which deals with mining waste, amendment No. 101, which deals with sugar beet, and new clause 5, which deals with contaminated land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Confederation of British Industry's minerals committee is concerned about mining waste. At sand and gravel sites, of which I have many in my constituency, or where mineral extraction takes place, a certain amount of waste is inevitable. If, under the provisions of the Bill, the waste is put into the hole from which the sand or gravel was dug, the company will be liable to pay the tax. That is unreasonable, and the amendment deals with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 101 relates to sugar beet. I am not an expert on the sugar beet industry, and no sugar beet is grown in my constituency, but this country produces 9 million tonnes a year. Even though the latest technology is used, the extraordinary fact remains that 1 million tonnes of mud stick to those 9 million tonnes of sugar beet and are taken to the factory. That is an awful lot of mud, but it cannot be reduced. Something must be done with the mud once the sugar beet has been washed, and although some is used for topsoil, most ends up in holes in the ground. That seems rather wasteful, but no better solution can apparently be found. The mud cannot be described as a waste produce in the usual sense, but tax will be payable on it as the Bill stands. British Sugar is, not surprisingly, extremely concerned about that. The amendment would address that concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Because it cannot find landscaping uses for all the soil, landfill is necessary. The brief continues:

I cannot, therefore, authoritatively answer the hon. Gentleman's question, although I know that British Sugar has tried to find alternative uses for what is essentially topsoil.

New clause 5 deals with contaminated land, about which building employers are also concerned. Most of such land is dealt with by means of the urban development grant. Provision for the tax will clearly not be made under the grant, and employers feel that the grant will, therefore, be less likely to be used to tackle contaminated land projects in the future. If most contaminated land is handled through payments of taxpayers' money, remitting the tax would be the sensible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond favourably to the three issues that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and new clause 5, which concerns contaminated land. I do not want to go back over the general arguments about the urgent need for the remediation of contaminated land so that it can be used for other purposes. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield was right to say that that is normally done through urban development grants which are sometimes piggy backed with European moneys in former coal or steel-producing areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where landfill site operators exercise their operation with the objective of remediating land that is contaminated or unsuitable for any further development, clearly there is a case for their disposals not to be recognised as practical disposals under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Iron and Steel Producers Association gave an illustration of such a process. The whole operation takes place on one site, which a company operates and registers as a landfill operator's site and which can cover several acres. First, it needs to dig the hole out—a process that is not subject to tax. The hole has to be lined with clay and the dug out, contaminated material has to be treated with lime to cleanse it and then put back into the hole. At that point the company becomes liable to the landfill tax. It is not clear whether the further operations of putting a rainproof impermeable cover on to the site to prevent any leachate from the site in future or giving it a covering of topsoil to enable it to be used for other, non-industrial purposes would also be subject to the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation upgrades and regenerates areas of a region or city that do not directly benefit the particular steel producer, because its direct benefit comes from steel production. It is, however, an indirect operation that must be done as part of the company's land management so that it makes the best use and best disposal of the surplus land on which it operates.

The steel industry and others would welcome the exclusion of such an operation and the type of deposits that it involves from the landfill tax. The British Iron and Steel Producers Association has cited the example of Ravenscraig—a long way from my constituency—to illustrate the cost of such an operation. Ravenscraig has allocated a budget of £24 million—a considerable sum of money—for site restoration, which will involve the removal of structures, digging and landscaping. Of that sum, £18.9 million has been designated for the removal of contaminated soil to a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, safe disposal facility—that is, a hole in the ground with satisfactory lining in which the soil is spread with lime and then covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will enable the crucial Ravenscraig site, which is in the middle of a residential area, to be developed for further use, thus preventing more encroachment on greenfield sites. The imposition of landfill tax at the rate of £7 per tonne in that operation would impose an additional cost of £11 million, almost 50 per cent. of the £24 million that British Steel has already put aside for improving the old Ravenscraig site. Clearly, that represents
	<br><blockquote><p>"an additional crushing burden to a project which has such significant environmental advantages",</p></blockquote>
as the company puts it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to the test-bed of the landfill tax. If it is to operate along the lines that Members on both sides of the Committee agree is appropriate, the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—and the amendments to clause 56 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South, which do much the same—need to be taken on board by the Government. The Government must find ways to ensure that an industry which recycles contaminated land for environmental purposes as a contribution to the region or community in which it operates should not suffer the crushing burden of the new tax that I have just described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield for tabling the amendment that has allowed us to have this important and useful debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 101 affects sugar beet, and I should declare an interest: I married into a farming family that grows a bit of sugar beet, and I have many constituents who grow that crop in large quantities. As we consider the proposed tax, I wonder how growers and processors of sugar beet might attempt to avoid it. Might farmers get a better price for their beet if they are encouraged to wash it before it leaves the farm? The proposal could cause the dispersal of the processing of the waste, thus making the problem worse and causing more difficulties with the regulation and collection of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that something as harmless as topsoil, which would unintentionally be caught by the tax, should be rendered exempt. The intervention from the hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) raised a spectre in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
my mind. If the National Farmers Union were to decide that topsoil was not inert material because it contained organisms such as rhizomania, it might not qualify as inert or inactive waste. It would therefore be taxed at £7 per tonne, making the problem for farmers three and a half times greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to tackle that problem and ensure that the Bill will not cause people to run around the countryside flytipping quantities of topsoil unnecessarily. It should be a perfectly harmless exercise to tip into a hole material that cannot be sold commercially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 44 on mineral extraction relates to an even more perplexing possibility. Gravel and minerals are vital resources for the development of our infrastructure, for roads and so many other necessities. The Bill's provisions will inevitably add to the cost of mineral extraction. It is worth considering how mineral extractors will avoid the tax. If one visits a gravel site, one can see that the plant that is processing the minerals can move into the hole. Minerals companies could argue that they have not extracted the product until they have treated it. The product's residue, they might say, remains in the hole throughout the process, so it has not been extracted. If they are not allowed to argue that, what is the purpose of the tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Operators are being taxed on landfill but the space for the landfill has never existed. The proposal amounts to a tax on creating the hole—the asset that we are trying to protect. To be taxed on the hole means—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is an instance of "When you're in a hole, keep digging"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is wrong. The lesson of the tax is that a hole previously regarded as an asset becomes a liability. I fear that the unintended motto of this tax for mineral extractors will be, "If you're in the hole, stop digging". Is that really the intended motto for the tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin) has thrown a spotlight on some of the great problems emerging as we examine the tax in detail. When we get to the stage of taxing holes and empty space, we are entitled to ask serious questions about how the tax's application was conceived. A sub-branch of the Treasury that probably reads the ecology pages of 	<i>The Guardian,</i> and nothing else, has probably been responsible for drafting the measure. People with beards wearing open-toed sandals have drafted the provision in that great hole at the bottom of Whitehall called the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be serious, however, there is great concern in Yorkshire and elsewhere. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) and I have had long consultations with steel industry representatives who want to adopt a responsible approach. They are worried that the landfill tax will have very serious repercussions on that vital industry. There is the well-known Yorkshire expression,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
"Where there's muck, there's brass". We may have a different approach, an acceptance that dirt and an element of waste is part of the wealth-creating process in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider mining, which is covered in the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. Each tonne of coal extracted—whether deep-mined, opencast or drift—can bring with it 30, 50 or 60 tonnes of overburden categorised as waste. At £2 a tonne in tax, that could add at least £60 to the cost of a tonne of coal. At that rate, nuclear electricity will be cheaper. I am sure that it is not the intention of those on the Treasury Front Bench to support Mr. Arthur Scargill and seek to put Mr. Budge out of business. I am sure that the president of the National Union of Mineworkers, the leader of this new Tory-supporting party—socialists for the continuation for capitalism or whatever it is called—will be delighted at the tax, because it will threaten the privatised mining industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of a controlled waste in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 explicitly excludes mineral waste, which comes from quarrying, mining and so forth. I hope that the Paymaster General will either accept amendments or take on board the serious representations that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal later with contaminated land. If I could helicopter members of the Committee up to my constituency of Rotherham, I could show them huge areas of land that were once covered with steel plants. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) will know of the Templeborough area, which was one of the giant, steel-making estates in south Yorkshire. It is now a completely empty brownfield site: it looks brown. Bit by bit new offices are being built, but decontaminating that land is extremely expensive. The business people of Rotherham and Rotherham council will collapse if they are told that they must add £7 to every tonne that they take away as they search to turn that part of my constituency into viable land on which new enterprises can spring up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to help the Committee by intervening earlier, but I obviously did not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with rhizomania is that it is a pest that attacks sugar beet only. In the past, British Sugar washed millions of tonnes of soil a year off the sugar beet and returned it to the farms from which the beet came, where it was returned to the fields in which the beet was grown. Because of the MAFF ruling—rather than a NFU ruling—farmers are unable to return the soil to fields where sugar beet is grown, but they can use it quite safely in other contexts. British Sugar tells me that that includes horticultural and landscaping works, recreational amenities, making improvements to agricultural land—presumably not land used for growing beet—civil engineering projects and the capping of landfills. The difficulty is that British Sugar has not found enough of those projects to use up a million tonnes of topsoil a year. The reason that it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
having difficulty is that it is not economic to cart the topsoil more than about 10 miles away from the factory, otherwise the transport costs are too great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that rhizomania is a general purpose contaminant, but it is a problem, especially for sugar beet. I seek reassurance that British Sugar will continue to maximise the recycling and use of soil and minimise the amount that goes to landfill. With that assurance, I would be happy to support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I must speak on amendment No. 44 given that much of my constituency, Dudley, West, and the black country is technically contaminated land. Merry Hill, a major shopping complex in my constituency, was built on a former steel site. If the landfill tax had come in during its construction, we would have had the ridiculous situation of the Government grants that had been provided to enable Merry Hill to be built being clawed back through the landfill tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

As someone who is interested in the economic development and redevelopment of my constituency and the black country, I have been involved in making direct land grant applications, working with English Partnerships, obtaining city grants and arranging partnership deals between the public and private sectors to ensure that redevelopment occurs. Both sides of the House accept that such practices are the way forward. The Government contribution to such deals—in which it is right that one should get involved—is deliberately the minimum that will enable the project to succeed, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said. The only probable result will be a sort of netting-off effect. Because Government grants are inevitably limited and English Partnerships has limited budgets, the latter will undertake less regeneration activity because part of its budget will have to pay landfill tax on its redevelopment sites and projects. That does not make sense in terms of the public purse. Can the Minister actively reconsider the situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield seeks to make mine and quarry waste non-taxable. We have consulted several interested parties and listened to the debate; the chairman of the CBI minerals committee came to see me and raised many of the same points as have been raised today. He described to me and my officials the structure and details of the quarrying industry. We never intended to tax that form of waste because it is not, by and large, controlled waste—I am talking not of contaminated or active waste but of waste rock or waste from a quarry or mine. The Department of the Environment clearly believes that such waste is inactive because it does not categorise it as controlled waste. If waste does not go into a registered landfill site, it falls without the Bill and would not be taxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister expand on his definition of mines? The waste from traditional quarries such as limestone quarries for road stone is one thing, but the waste that might be recovered from an opencast operation, for example, in an area where there has formerly been industry may be in a different category. Does the Minister include any type of opencast operation in his definition or does he make sub-divisions within that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about naturally occurring material that has not been subject to any industrial process. Normally, it would, therefore, include material that had to be removed from an opencast mine to win the underlying coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was coming to the difficulties that have arisen. In some cases, such waste material is placed in registered landfill sites. That can happen if the site receives material from outside the quarry or mine in the normal course of landfilling. Sometimes, to restore a site, it is required that it be filled up with waste from outside as well as with normal quarry waste. The addition of that external waste means that the site must be registered. Therefore, the site becomes a landfill site so, as things stand, all the material placed in it—previously controlled and uncontrolled—would be taxable. That is an undesirable outcome and we want to correct it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will, therefore, consult further with those concerned about the precise wording of the amendment. I expect that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield tabled his amendment in a probing spirit. We want to get the wording precise, unambiguous and properly targeted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very often, there might be a single site for gravel extraction—there is an example in my constituency—which is also a landfill site. Waste is created inside the site, beneath ground level, and transported to another part of the site for landfill. Can my hon. Friend confirm that he intends that waste that arises in the hole should remain there and that there is no intention to catch that in the landfill tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That follows from what I just said. I am familiar with some quarries. They exist in my constituency and, very often, material is moved from one side of the site to the other. We do not intend to tax that. That is not a landfilling operation. Problems have arisen where the site—or part of it—is a landfill site, necessarily registered because it accepts other material, but where some material is taken to another site to be landfilled. However, such material remains the same, naturally occurring rock and we do not intend that it should be subjected to the tax. Indeed, it was not included in our revenue forecasts for the tax so it was clearly not our intention to extend the scope of the tax in that way. I repeat my offer to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield to consider the issue further and to continue our discussions to give statutory effect to that intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are familiar with the issue of soil on root vegetables and on sugar beet in particular. The subject arose in the debate on the Floor of the House. If I understood him correctly, my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
for Colchester, North made an interesting comment that beet farmers in his constituency were paid extra if they washed the material—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might become so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they are paid or might be paid extra, that is a way of keeping the soil where it belongs—on the original farm—and not transporting it to the factory with the subsequent possibility that it will have to be landfilled or disposed of. One of the aims of the landfill tax is to promote waste minimisation—to prevent waste from arising in the first place. If the tax has the effect suggested by my hon. Friend, that will be beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Realistically, a considerable tonnage of material will always adhere to root vegetables and that will have to be dealt with at the factory and disposed of. The hon. Member for York and others told us that some of the material was sold, used for horticulture, landscaping or golf courses, returned to pasture or disposed of in some other useful way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it my hon. Friend's intention to increase food prices? Sugar is a staple part of everybody's diet. We do not put VAT on food. Do the Government intend the landfill tax to have a knock-on effect on food prices? The implication of what my hon. Friend has just said is that farmers' costs will go up. Is it his intention that the cost of processing beet, and therefore the cost of sugar, should rise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not food, but landfilling of soil that is to be taxed. It is undesirable that good soil from British farms should be disposed of to landfill. The tax will encourage alternative uses. If the soil does not remain on the farm and is washed off the roots at the factory, it should be used for alternative purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of rhizomania. It is surprising what one learns in this job. I have already undertaken to ensure that there are further discussions on the issue between MAFF and British Sugar. British Sugar has adopted a responsible attitude and does not want the disease to be spread. We are, luckily, comparatively free of that peculiar disease, which is found only in parts of Norfolk and Suffolk. It is in everyone's interest that it should be confined to those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be opportunities to amend the regulations or the voluntary agreement between British Sugar and MAFF to facilitate the return of the soil to some farms, although it cannot go back to the same farms from which it came. British Sugar could adopt various approaches to minimise the impact of the tax. I am told that it has already made considerable progress in reducing the quantity of material that has to go to landfill. I hope that I have convinced my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that his proposal for a class exemption is not attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can also be helpful on the issue of contaminated land. There are alternatives to the landfilling of contaminated land. It does not always have to be dug up and reburied in a landfill site. I am advised that bio remediation is increasingly feasible,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
as are vitrification, washing of soil, dechlorination and incineration. In some cases, such methods would be financially advantageous if the alternative of landfilling was taxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The steel industry is a recycling industry. Less than 20 per cent. of material involved in production is not recycled, sent to slag reduction firms or used in some other useful way. Members of the steel industry are concerned that they might need to use that waste for recycling. A proportion of that might then have to go back to waste. They would be paying twice on the same waste, even though it was being used for a productive recycling purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have understood the hon. Lady correctly, other provisions in the Bill will assist. Waste put to one side, with the intention of recycling it, can be relieved from the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue before us is whether the landfilling of contaminated land should attract tax. In some cases, that might be just: in principal, those who contaminate should clear up the mess. It is not clear why they should be exempted. Nevertheless, I realise that a great deal of contaminated land was contaminated many years ago, and that new owners or new public authorities lack the means to clean up the site. They often, therefore, have an incentive to develop greenfield sites, rather than brown sites where we would often prefer development to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, there is a case for reconsidering whether we can ring-fence and identify an enforceable way of exempting contaminated land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is obviously aware that historically contaminated land is a vast problem in Britain. I understand that the Government are considering introducing a contamination of land Bill, which would deal specifically with historically polluted land, and with determining who is responsible for cleaning it up or whether it should be landfilled. How would the provisions in the Bill fit in with proposals that are being considered for a contamination of land Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the issue that we shall have to address. The Environmental Protection Act 1990, section 78A—which is mentioned in amendments and new clauses tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and by Opposition Members—will not work in respect of that problem, because it is designed to examine the current use of the land, and problems arising from that, whereas our concern is contamination that has occurred in the past. For that reason, new clause 5 is not adequate to put our intentions into statute. I hope that the Committee agrees that I have signalled that we shall want to come back on Report with a way of exempting contaminated land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon.

He said that he would like to take away the questions of mineral waste and contaminated waste, and deal with the points that are of concern to members of the Committee. That is extremely welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the arguments relating to sugar beet are not clear. Perhaps it would be possible for MAFF to deal with it in the way that my hon. Friend suggested, although MAFF seems to be part of the problem. It is sometimes said that accountants have no sense of humour, so I should report that Mr. John Whiting of Price Waterhouse, who has already been quoted in the Committee, has said that, in his opinion, imposing landfill tax on sugar beet would be a bitter pill to swallow. I rather agree with that, but producers will have to cope with it, and perhaps change their behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the clause is to allow operators maximum flexibility, and to prevent temporary storage of waste from being taxable when it is moved up the waste hierarchy at a later stage.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to explain why. The amendment would have dealt with two principles. The first was that material that had a further use would be exempt from tax, because it would be used for other purposes. If I have interpreted it correctly, amendment No. 89 will exempt for 12 months material to be used for an alternative purpose. That will encourage waste minimisation and an example has been given concerning topsoil and sugar beet.

The second part of amendment No. 55 would have dealt with historically contaminated land, especially in cities where we shall seek land for development of housing projects. A developer might subsequently discover that extensive contamination required removal of contaminated waste from the site under other statutory obligations. The Paymaster General gave an undertaking to consider the question of contaminated land within certain parameters. He does not intend to exempt everything because, as he rightly said, not all land is contaminated historically.

A significant international example, based in the south Yorkshire area, is that of the Earth Centre. Hon. Members may not have heard of that, but it has recently attracted £60 million of lottery money, as part of the Millenium fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is a huge project, based on the site of the former Denaby main coal mine. A large acreage of that mine is to be flattened and smoothed out. Earth will be moved to create a major centre of international repute for new environmental technologies. That imaginative project will be built into a hillside and is a key millenium project.

It would be sad and inexcusable if £20 million of that £60 million had to be recycled to the Treasury as a landfill tax. As the Earth Centre is on the verge of starting the operational side of its development, I urge the Minister to clarify the form of words to be included in the Bill to exempt that and other major projects with environmental intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DISPOSAL BY WAY OF LANDFILL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 38, line 21, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"except that a disposal by way of landfill shall not occur where such cavity is in the ownership of and under the control of the person who has produced the material deposited in such cavity and such disposal represents the best practicable environmental option for the disposal of such material and as a consequence of such disposal the material deposited will not give rise to environmental pollution.".</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with a special hole called a cavity. The remarkable thing about a cavity is that it is not on the surface, but a long way below the surface and therefore much more environmentally friendly than a hole in the ground. The British salt industry is especially concerned. When salt is produced, as with most mineral production processes, some waste is generated. The materials that comprise the salt purification residues are returned in a closed loop via pipelines to their place of origin in cavities several hundred metres below ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No environmental impact arises from that method of disposal. Indeed, the land above the cavities is farmed normally, so no one knows what is going on below ground. In those circumstances, it is

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
unreasonable to impose the landfill tax. Has my hon. Friend considered that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are considering that, and we have had discussions with the companies involved. In general, a cavity should not be exempt from the principle of the tax. It still has an environmental impact of some sort, although I accept, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, that the impact is less than that of the more traditional landfill on the surface. I think that I can be helpful, if not by exempting the concept of a cavity, at least by reconsidering the sort of material that goes into cavities. The material that is pumped back into cavities would be classified as active waste because, although it is not too actively polluting, it has undergone a chemical reaction. Therefore, companies are not putting back into the ground exactly what they took out—minus the salt of course. We are reconsidering that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be possible to recognise the non-polluting nature of the material and put it into a lower category, or there might be a way of examining the water content of the material, which has the effect of increasing its bulk and weight. We must decide whether to tax the solid material or the material in solution. One way or another, although perhaps not in the way the amendment suggests, I believe that we can respond positively to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcom Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading, the Minister made a confession in relation to dredging, on which strong representations were made. Does not the Minister accept that the materials that are likely to be present in the residue from dredging could be more active and more varied? At the moment, we are talking about chemical material that is not very active, although salt is a chemical. But is not there a fair comparison? Given that the Minister made concessions for dredging, does not the salt industry have a point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the comparison is exact because dredging is usually undertaken specifically for environmental or navigational purposes, and the material that is taken out of the bed of the harbour, river or canal got there only as a result of natural forces. So companies are simply putting back on to the bank material that has washed into the water courses. There is a difference between that and the more industrial activity of extracting brine from underground cavities, treating it, extracting the salt and putting back underground some sort of solution that contains materials, perhaps in suspension, that might or might not have been there in the first place. We are examining those points, but I do not accept that there is a direct comparison with dredging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am most obliged to my hon. Friend for his extremely helpful reply. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(e) it is otherwise used for the disposal of controlled waste".</p></blockquote>
When one creates a new tax, one also creates the possibilities of new sorts of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The purpose of the amendment is to draw to the attention of my hon. Friend a legal alternative to landfill that is likely to become more attractive because of the imposition of the tax. It is possible, quite legitimately, to spread several waste products on agricultural land—for example, sewage sludge. I understand that 13 different kinds of waste can be dealt with in that way, including waste soil, waste lime, textile waste and sludge from biological treatment plants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be an increase in flytipping and the illegal disposal of waste, which will have to be watched very carefully, but there will also be an incentive to find legal alternatives. I wished to draw the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister to that possibility by means of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 58 defines what is meant by a landfill site for the purpose of the tax. The definition is linked to the licensing provisions of the environmental law. It is designed to ensure that there is a clear definition to prevent disputes over what constitutes a landfill site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the amendment is that it would blur that definition, with a rather peculiar consequence. If accepted, the amendment would mean that every time people put a dustbin out or dropped a sweet packet they would be making a taxable disposal, as the land on which they put their rubbish would become a landfill site. That would make the people involved liable to be registered and to account for landfill tax. Therefore, we would all have to register for the tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield observed on Tuesday that it was a good thing that there were only 1,400 taxable operators: there would be 56 million if the amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand my hon. Friend's point, but will he accept that it is not one of his better amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my amendment is a little premature. We should start with the 1,400 site operators and see how we get on. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clause</i> 62 	<i>ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 45, That clause 62 be transferred to follow clause 34.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 62 is the interpretation clause. Given that the landfill tax is new, it would be sensible and logical to move the interpretation to the beginning of the provisions dealing with it. That raises the question of the simplification of tax. It is inevitable that a certain amount of complexity should surround the introduction of new tax such as the landfill tax. However, moving the clause to the front of the provisions would help. I hope that when Inland Revenue taxes are simplified, the definitions will be put first, so that people will know what is being talked about, before the tax provisions are detailed. That is the thinking behind the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like many amendments tabled by my hon. Friend, this proposal is interesting and not necessarily a bad idea. It is certainly an improvement on the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The location of the definitions in the Bill is really a matter of taste and convenience. By tradition, they tend to go at the end. My hon. Friend thinks that they should go at the beginning so that we know what we are talking about before embarking on the substance of the Bill. On the other hand, there is some merit in discussing the substance of the Bill and if we wish to make changes to the definition, we can do that at the end. Perhaps I should dwell a little more on this issue. Would my hon. Friend accept a temporary rejection, because I am sure we will return to this matter in the general context of simplification?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word about simplification, because I know that it is of great interest to my hon. Friend. Customs and Excise takes seriously its mission not just to tax but to explain to people why they are being taxed. We must discuss simplification later in our proceedings: the Opposition have tabled a new clause.

I ask hon. Members to bear in mind that Customs and Excise is not an entirely free agent with regard to taxation: it is heavily influenced by European directives. It cannot take unilateral action in quite the same way as the Inland Revenue can. The good news is that customs has launched the Legis project, which, although it is somewhat long term, is a determined effort to bring greater consistency and a degree of simplification to Customs and Excise law. If it is acceptable to my hon. Friend, he may care to press me further, perhaps by way of parliamentary question, to describe in a little more detail what Customs and Excise is doing in this field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, there we are. Although my hon.
