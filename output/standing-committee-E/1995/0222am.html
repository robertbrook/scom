<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ANNUAL PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN INSURANCE POLICIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Financial Secretary tell us why the clause is necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with that. The clause introduces an income tax exemption for payments received by or in respect of individuals under certain types of insurance policies that people take out, or may contribute to through employers' schemes, to give themselves financial protection in times of sickness and unemployment. Such policies come in many different guises but they share the common feature that they provide regular payments during those times. They may be earmarked to meet mortgage payments or other financial commitments, or they may simply be used to meet ordinary living expenses.<br><br>
The clause was introduced after discussion in the public prints because doubt had been raised by a conversation between a taxpayer and the Revenue over the tax position of payments under a mortgage protection policy. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor deemed this to be a matter of genuine public concern. We do not want tax to be levied on the proceeds of that type of risk policy. A comprehensive examination of a range of other types of insurance was undertaken and, as a result, clause 134 was included in the Bill to put the tax position beyond doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked the question because I was intrigued to hear what the Financial Secretary would say in support of the clause. As he hinted, this matter has a history. It was the subject of comment in the print and broadcast media in May last year. The press cuttings and reports from that time make interesting reading.<br><br>
It is fascinating that the Government's position until 3 May last year was that the clause was not necessary, because the payments to which the Financial Secretary referred were not subject to tax and there was no difficulty. However, on 10 March last year the then Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security confirmed to mortgage lenders that benefits
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
under policies such as those referred to in the clause were taxable. The Chancellor said that the tax would not be collected and it was not a problem. On 27 April, the then Financial Secretary said that the Government had no plans to review the matter.<br><br>
On 2 May, the shadow Chancellor, my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), said that it was the intention of the Labour party to force a vote on the matter. Half an hour later, the former Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that there were still no plans to change the law; but half an hour after that Downing street said that the policy was under review. Two hours later the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said that the policy as it then existed was "nuts, lunacy and madness". Approximately 40 minutes after the hon. Gentleman had made his views known, the Chancellor announced a complete change and a U-turn in the Government's policy.<br><br>
I awaited with great interest the present Financial Secretary's bland assurances that the Government had examined the problem and were tidying up a few loose ends. It did not seem like that at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on what he thinks is the causal factor of the change? Did the hon. Member for Macclesfield, who spoke disparagingly about the policy, bring about the change? Clearly, it was a mess, but what brought about the change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting lesson in what happens when the Government are caught with their collective trousers down. They were bounced by extensive press publicity. The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> screamed
<br><blockquote><p>"Tory chaos over tax climbdown"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"Clarke contradicts Major on mortgage cover".</p></blockquote>
How strange that the Chancellor and the Prime Minister should fall out not only on inheritance tax, capital gains tax and the appropriate borrowing ratio, but on this matter too. They clearly fell out, however. The Prime Minister said in the House that the Government had been reviewing the tax position on this issue for some months; at the same time, the Chancellor said that the first that he knew of the problem was at 11.30 the previous day. It is quite obvious that one half of the Government did not know what the other half were doing, even though they had been put on notice by the Council of Mortgage Lenders that benefits under certain insurance policies were subject to tax.<br><br>
If the Government's original assertion was right, why is the provision costed at £10 million in the Red Book? That implies that some, although not much tax must have been taken out of the system. Clearly, the Government—under popular pressure and pressure from the Opposition—changed their mind and executed yet another U-turn. The quotations that I read out all came from papers that traditionally support the Conservative cause—they were not left wing or Labour supporters. The <i>Daily Telegraph's</i> comment was damning.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0470">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
My attention was drawn to an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 6 May—three days after the confusion and chaos to which I referred. Under the heading
<br><blockquote><p>"U-turn on tax may have created loophole",</p></blockquote>
the writer says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Insurance experts believe the industry will try to exploit any new tax breaks given to mortgage protection insurance policies by dressing up other types of insurance such as permanent health insurance, to look like mortgage protection".</p></blockquote>
That brings me to proposed new section 580A(5), which bears reading. I want to find out what the Financial Secretary thinks that it means. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of subsection (2)(d) above provisions relating to a qualifying risk are of a qualifying type if they are of such a description that their inclusion in any policy of insurance containing provisions relating only to a comparable risk would (apart from any reinsurance) involve the possibility for the insurer that a significant loss might be sustained on the amounts payable by way of premiums in respect of the risk, taken together with any return on the investment of those amounts."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that that is no different from many other clauses in the Bill—it takes two or three readings to work out what it means. Will the Financial Secretary explain it? What is meant by
<br><blockquote><p>"a significant loss might be sustained"?</p></blockquote>
Does it mean significant in relation to the policy as a whole—that is, that the potential significant loss would have to relate to the qualifying policies—or does it mean a significant sum of money? I raise that point because the <i>Financial Times</i> writer and others have noted that when a tax exemption is given—we are all familiar with this—there is a risk that people will try to issue a qualifying policy. Such a policy is, however, not a qualifying policy, and simply seeks protection under clause 134.<br><br>
That brings me to my second point. Proposed new section 580B(1) says that the policy must be "self-contained". Bearing in mind the doctrine of Petter <i>v</i> Hart, will the Minister tell us what self-contained means? Proposed new section 580B(2) allows policies to cover other risks, provided that the terms that relate to those qualifying risks would not have been "significantly different" if the policy had been a standalone policy. What does "significantly different" mean? How will the Revenue decide whether a policy qualifies?<br><br>
Hon. Members who were members of the Committee last year will recall that the Revenue no longer certifies policies for other purposes. Will the Revenue issue certificates in respect of clause 134 policies to show whether they qualify for relief, or will that happen only when the taxpayer disputes the Revenue's assessment? It is important that the Government explain what the terms "self-contained", "significant loss" and "significantly different" mean. In the interests of clarity, a statement from the Minister about the Government's intentions will be useful for those who plan such matters. It would be regrettable if that clarity was not available until a court ruling has been made or the Revenue is challenged.<br><br>
Why will the measure cost £10 million a year? Last year, the Government said that in practice little, if any,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
tax had been collected from insurance benefits from this type of policy. Clearly, some tax must have been collected, so we are entitled to know what policies were covered and affected by that £10 million, and what has changed.<br><br>
The episode demonstrates the problems that arise when one half of the Government do not know what the other half are doing. Interestingly, the two halves in question were the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, and it is instructive that they do not appear to speak to each other. I believe the Chancellor when he says that the first that he knew about the problem was at 11.30 in the morning on the day before he was asked. Given the Chancellor's interest in detail, that is not surprising. However, the Prime Minister claimed that the matter had been under review for some months.<br><br>
The two accounts do not square with each other. That might be an interesting example of sophistry. It is not clear whether the Prime Minister misled the House of Commons inadvertently, or deliberately inadvertently—but it is an instructive episode for students of government who want to see how the decision was made. The Government were forced into a decision that we believe is right. We support the clause, but we are entitled—given the Government's conduct of business and their sometimes lax attitude to loopholes—to a clear statement from the Minister as to how the term "significant", as used in the contexts that I have described, should be interpreted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to prolong the Government's embarrassment, and I shall not repeat all the details revealed by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), but the Financial Secretary owes the Committee an explanation. Was what happened last spring an example of Government incompetence, Government duplicity, or both? As my hon. Friend said, one half of the Government did not know what the other half were doing.<br><br>
The clearest example of that was on 2 May, when the then chairman of the Conservative party said that there was no such policy and no review, only for the then Financial Secretary to say at 11 o'clock that there was such a policy and such a review. As the Leader of the Opposition said at Prime Minister's Questions that day:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is strange that the chairman of the Conservative party did not know about that—or perhaps it is not strange".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 2 May 1995; Vol. 251, c. 166.]</p></blockquote>
What is more surprising is that one half of the Treasury team did not know what the other half was doing. We all know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that evening that the measure was an obscure piece of tax law and that he had not known about it until 11.30 that morning.<br><br>
The obvious explanation is that the Chancellor did not know what was going on. One of the Chancellor's virtues is that he will blurt out what others would keep under wraps, but there are other possible explanations. For example, it is possible that the Prime Minister, when he referred that afternoon to the review that had been going on for months, was misleading the House—with or without duplicitous intent. The Financial Secretary must explain to the Committee why there was such a shambles at the heart of Government.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the plea for the Financial Secretary to say sorry on behalf of the Chancellor. The situation was a shambles last year, and exposed the lack of consideration and structured planning at the heart of so much of our tax system. If, however, he is unable to say sorry, he should at least place on record some formal explanation other than the helter-skelter of press releases that we saw and the Chancellor phoning up the Press Association to dictate his new policy turn himself. Much as we may admire the power that the hon. Member for Macclesfield has over our taxation policy—he was a distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee last year—it is absurd that a single Back Bencher can throw the planning of our nation's finances into such a tizzy.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
I should like to advance slightly further and ask two specific questions. Clause 134 is one of the longest clauses in the Bill, at 240 lines. Constructive as it is, it may contain at least two potential problems. The law of unintended consequences, which applies more to the Finance Bill than to any other piece of legislation, should be borne in mind here.<br><br>
First, will the Financial Secretary take us through subsection 580A(7), which deals with the question of third parties taking out insurance on behalf of someone else? Clearly, when that is done as a form of extra payment by a company, say, it may be fight that any benefit that is received under it should be taxed. However, it is not right when insurance is taken out by a parent, for example, or a trust—one thinks of people who take out all forms of insurance for their children. As I read the clause, benefit that is paid to a third party will be liable to tax. Many parents take out insurance, for all sorts of reasons. I think of my own children, who are on a day camp during their half term holiday this week. Insurance has been taken out for them and were they, God forbid, to have some kind of accident, it is not clear whether any benefit that they might receive would be taxed.<br><br>
The answer to my second question may be hidden unintentionally in the Bill. The Financial Secretary will be aware of the big debate that is taking place in Germany on the use of the pensions system to pay, in effect, for early retirement. Companies are laying off older workers—aged 50 and over—and thus effectively transferring the burden of supporting those employees on to the German pensions system. As we know, their pensions system is more generous than ours but that practice is placing intolerable burdens on it.<br><br>
The clause worries me because I can foresee mechanisms whereby individuals—probably in the higher payment range—can arrange to take out forms of unemployment insurance and pay handsome premiums as part of their remuneration package but with a view to becoming unemployed.<br><br>
The reasons for unemployment, either voluntary or involuntary, are hard to decipher these days. I can see a handsome potential loophole when a small company or partnership intends to release staff in the next few years and suggests entering a major insurance scheme against unemployment. Policies are sold aggressively by insurance companies today in a very insecure job
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
market. Benefits from such policies appear to be tax free. I may be wrong but that is my reading of the Bill and I should like the Financial Secretary to confirm it.<br><br>
I want to alert people who read the Finance Bill <i>Hansard</i> carefully to any potential loopholes that might arise from the clause. It may well be an application of the law of inintended consequences. Will the Financial Secretary clarify the taxation of benefits received when a third party such as parents or close relatives is involved? What is to prevent people, companies, partnerships, closed companies or single traders from taking out large insurance packages with a view to tax-free relief, knowing that unemployment is likely?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of my colleagues have spoken about the Government shambles last May when they pointed to decisions made on a virtually minute-by-minute basis. One of the issues that they have not highlighted is the reason of their haste. The discussions took place in the first week in May. On the first Thursday of May, of course, council elections were held. It is clear that Ministers wanted to sort the issues out before those elections because they did not want further to damage—if that were possible—their reputation with householders. That is the real reason for the change.<br><br>
At the time the Chancellor of the Exchequer was asked why he had made a U-turn on mortgages and he replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"I just sorted out some complete nonsense about a supposed tax that never was. It's an obscure piece of tax law which I didn't know about until half past eleven this morning, and having discovered what they were talking about, simply sorted it all out."</p></blockquote>
That was not good enough. The drive to sort it all out was the desire not to alienate people who were buying their own homes and who have been so badly hit by the Government's economic policies.<br><br>
The clause provides exemption from tax subject to certain conditions for benefits paid under insurance policies for loss caused by accident, sickness, disability, infirmity or unemployment and for the cost of long-term care. The Minister should focus on that aspect of the clause because the cost of long-term care is one of the key social policy issues that we all face.<br><br>
I draw particular attention to subsection (4)(a) on page 92, which states that the concession will be operated if there is any
<br><blockquote><p>"illness, disability, infirmity or defect which is insured against … and any related period of convalescence or rehabilitation".</p></blockquote>
The words "convalescence" and "rehabilitation" both imply that someone is going to get better, yet this part of the clause exists to provide tax concessions against an insurance policy for someone who is in long-term care. That is a real and punishing matter for us all, because the number of people who are over the age of 85 is spiralling all the time, as graphs clearly show.<br><br>
The number of people in residential and nursing homes has increased, and the costs—to them and to the Exchequer—are immense. I have come across many harrowing examples of people in nursing home care who have been forced to dispose of their savings and, ultimately, sell their houses to stay in the nursing home.<br><br>
We can neither support nor afford this piece of social policy. We must look for changes. The Budget statement and subsequent announcements by the Prime
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
Minister made it clear that the Government were to review how nursing and residential home charges could be contained and how policy could be made more customer friendly. At the moment, that policy is punitive. I hope that the Minister will say how far that review has gone, what progress has been made, and in what direction.<br><br>
Subsection (4)(d) states that the tax concession follows a period of illness or unemployment or
<br><blockquote><p>"any period immediately following the end, as a result of the death of the insured".</p></blockquote>
That is an interesting comment. What is the "period immediately following" someone's death—a day or two, a week, three months? What is the scope of that phrase?<br><br>
Finally, I want the Financial Secretary to dwell a moment on the cost to the Exchequer of the clause. At line 13 of table 5.1 in the Red Book, a recurrent cost is given of £10 million for the periods 1996–97 and 1998–99. It is noted that the figure excludes tax that currently is foregone. However, paragraph 17 in the notes on clauses states that in practice little if any tax was collected from insurance benefits paid from policies such as these. On the one hand we are told that little money has been collected, yet on the other the Red Book states that there is a cost of £10 million. The two statements do not sit comfortably together.<br><br>
I shall be grateful if the Financial Secretary will explain that. More pressing is the need for him to make clear what he and his colleagues are doing to try to resolve the appalling conditions faced by elderly people forced to go into nursing home care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On some mornings I wake up and read in my newspaper about a football match that I have watched. When I read the report, I wonder whether the reporter was at the same game. That is how the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) sounded this morning. He and his hon. Friends had some fun at the Government's expense in terms of perhaps differing views on a particular subject which burst into the public prints last May. The hon. Gentleman went at the issue with tigerish fervour. I can assume only that he had at least four Shredded Wheat for breakfast, rather than the requisite three—or perhaps it was Scotts porridge oats. I had my porridge this morning, so perhaps members of the Committee will see a bit of a spark from me.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
I mentioned the issue in May. Perhaps there was some confusion because quite often when a local inspector takes a different view from everybody else, there may be an element of confusion. People may not be entirely certain of the facts when an event challenges their perception of things.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor was unaware that there was any tax liability. Therefore it was right for him to take the view that he did. Perhaps others were waiting for advice. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central must realise that rulings that are given by individual tax inspectors are entirely independent. The hon. Gentleman tried to create the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
impression that the situation was in some way a fault of Government policy.<br><br>
The issue arose when a taxpayer was given a piece of information by an inspector. Not unnaturally, when that taxpayer learned that payments under his mortgage protection policy might have a tax liability, the issue became public. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor said—sensibly—that if there was doubt about the tax treatment of that policy, perhaps we should consider the whole area of people's insurance, make certain that tax treatment is properly dealt with and, if necessary, make some beneficial changes, which I shall deal with in response to specific questions from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To pursue the Financial Secretary's analogy, clearly we were at different football matches. He claims that the matter arose as a result of a decision by some errant or wayward tax inspector somewhere in England. My point was that on 10 March—almost two months before the Chancellor first heard about it—a junior Minister wrote a public letter which said that those policies were taxable. In the following weeks, successive Ministers said that there was no review and no plan to change the policy.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary's assertion that the whole issue was sprung on the Government as the result of a wayward decision by a tax inspector and that the Chancellor then blundered in and sorted it out overnight does not square with the facts. I am fortified in that belief by the fact that the Prime Minister told the House—I am quite sure that he told hon. Members the exact position—that far from the matter having just been sprung on the Government, there had been a review in hand for some months. The only person who did not know about that review was the Chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my right hon. and learned Friend put matters beyond doubt, as clause 134 shows. If there was doubt, the matter has now been clarified. In the era of instant media judgment in which we live, it sometimes pays to step back and take some time to consider the detail. That is exactly what we did.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and his hon. Friends asked about the costs in the Red Book that are related to that policy. One of the benefits of clause 134 is that it exempts from tax those payments that arise from personal health insurance policies where the payments were originally taxed beyond 12 months of the said amounts being paid out. Such payments are now relieved from tax, from which comes the cost element. I hope that puts the matter beyond any doubt.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central had several specific questions, to which I shall do my best to reply. He asked about subsection (5). It means that investment or savings policies are excluded, so the exemption is limited to real-risk policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where does it say that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am replying to the hon. Gentleman's questions about subsection (5).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Minister, I dislike this tennis ball effect. Either give way to Mr. Darling to hear his question or stand firm.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue the set. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked me a series of questions and I am doing my best to answer them. I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question about subsection (5).<br><br>
I was asked about the term "significantly different". The definition applies in cases where the provision stops linking policies and the shifting of benefits between policies to gain the benefit of exemption. "Significantly" is used because we want to keep in normal hybrid policies when only minor changes could occur.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about "self-contained". It prevents value shifting from non-exempt type insurance to a policy that pays out exempt benefits. It stops investment-type policies from being treated tax free. The clause deals effectively with risk-type insurance. The provision was intended as an anti-abuse measure, which deals with a point raised by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane). It may help the Committee if I describe in more detail the types of policy that are dealt with in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way and I am not playing any more tennis. I must give information to the Committee before the hon. Gentleman puts more questions.<br><br>
The clause deals with mortgage payment protection insurance, which provides income to meet mortgage commitments in the event of accident, sickness, disability or unemployment; permanent health insurance, which provides continuing income in the event of accident, sickness or disability; creditor insurance, which provides benefits to meet existing obligations and commitments such as loans and domestic utility bills again in circumstances of accident, sickness, disability or unemployment; and certain types of long-term care insurance, which provide benefits to meet the cost of the provision of care in the event of accident, sickness, disability or infirmity—only when policies have been taken out before the need for care becomes apparent. Now I shall give way to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that you do not like tennis, Mr. Hill, but intervening can be helpful to promote clarity. Will policies be certified as qualifying by the Inland Revenue in advance of their issue, or is there a risk that a policy issued in good faith under the clause will subsequently be deemed not to be covered?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had anticipated the question by describing with clarity the types of policy dealt with by the clause. We are talking about insurance risk policies, not qualifying life insurance policies which are dealt with in a later clause. If an insurance company has any doubt about the status of policies it can seek advice from the Revenue.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will also know that one aspect of advice is currently the subject of a consultation exercise—pre-transaction rulings. Current informal arrangements are available. We sought to remove doubt about the matter and carried out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
extensive consultations with the insurance industry. We wanted to ensure that the clause covered all the policies over which doubt might have been cast. Those to whom we talked supported our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the hon. Gentleman's point, but I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What would happen if I were employed in a small company and took out a handsome insurance policy that offered benefits against unemployment—although not mortgage, health or creditor debts? If I became unemployed two or three years later, would those benefits be tax free? If so, the Government are—wittingly or not—potentially opening the way to serious abuses, given the current tragic state of job insecurity in our labour market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have observed from the list that I read out that we are dealing with the consequences of the contingencies that relate to an individual's liabilities. I put the matter in general terms because, as the hon. Gentleman may have observed from my list, I talked about the consequences of unemployment, not about unemployment <i>per se.</i><br><br>
To conclude on the point of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, the Revenue will not be in the business of producing a pre-certification process for the policies while advice is available. The insurance industry will not, however, be left without information to assist them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham asked about third parties that took out such policies. An employer may take out a policy to provide employees with similar benefits as if they had done so themselves. Holders of such policies may qualify for tax exemption on payments that they receive under a policy if the employee has made a contribution to the premium. An employer may be involved in that way.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the coverage of insurance for his children and its consequences. The provisions do not apply when a parent takes out a policy on behalf of a child. The only exemption in the case of a third party is that to which I have just referred.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) took us onto an important matter. There should be no disagreement about the need to face up squarely to the substantial financial implications of long-term care. If the hon. Gentleman reread my right hon. and learned Friend's Budget speech, he would find two other proposals, which deal in detail with the Government's policy direction on the matter—the change to the capital disregard procedures and the promised consultation exercise on partnership to develop further policies for long-term care. Those clearly demonstrate that the Government take the issue seriously.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me specifically about the term
<br><blockquote><p>"any period immediately following … death".</p></blockquote>
Basically, the clause is designed to ensure that there should be no effective limit on the continuation of payments from such policies where the surviving spouse, whose need for the income will continue, is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
covered by the insurance policy. That is a helpful set of words for the survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return the Minister to the point about the consultation exercise looking into long-term care that is being undertaken with partners? Where has that got to? If the Minister cannot help now, I hope that he will give me the information at some future date.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point. The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about subsection (4)(a), which covers long-term care. I can tell him that the Revenue considers that the needs are a defect or infirmity. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.<br><br>
Earlier, I may have inadvertently misled the hon. Member for Rotherham slightly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Deliberately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, as the hon. Gentleman knows, I may be deliberate in what I say but I am always the first to apologise if I say anything that is wrong, even if I did not deliberately set out to be wrong.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham asked about the policies that refer to children. The provisions of the clause apply to payments, which are exempt. For the avoidance of doubt, I shall write a letter to the hon. Gentleman to make the matter absolutely clear in case he is considering a major decision about the future insurance provision of his children. I shall ensure that a copy of the letter is placed in the Library of the House.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with the justifiable questions raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to deal with this clause in a short time, but I am afraid that that will not be possible. I appreciate your reluctance, Mr. Hill, to allow what you called a "tennis match", but I have to press the Financial Secretary further about the clause's interpretation.<br><br>
I noted that, in his remarks, the Financial Secretary set off on a defence of the Government that he later abandoned under cross examination. That defence did not stand up. Most people know that this decision was an example of the Government appearing to be caught all over the place. The Financial Secretary said that he did not like Government being told what to do by the front page of the newspapers, but that is what happened. The right hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt) was in the Cabinet 12 months ago and might have been able to cast some light on the matter, but perhaps he is writing his memoirs as we speak and is saving the truth for the future.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary attempted to explain the problem away by saying that it had arisen because of an unexpected decision by an inspector of taxes somewhere in the country. That is important precisely because it may happen again when the provisions of the clause come to be examined again by an inspector or a tribunal.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
I asked specifically what subsection (5) meant and what it excludes, and the Financial Secretary told me that it excludes policies that would really be savings or investment measures. That would be fine, except that subsection (5) does not say that. On a plain reading, I think that the subsection states that for a policy to qualify a significant part of it must be a qualifying policy. It would not matter if the policy includes an insignificant part that has non-qualifying parts, as the tax relief would still be there. However, that has nothing to do with savings and investment. The Minister may be right to say that savings and investment policies are not included but subsection (5) does not say that.<br><br>
We hope that taxpayers will take out this type of insurance. We want to avoid the situation, however, where a taxpayer, having taken out an insurance policy that he believes is a qualifying policy under the clause, then remains ill for a long time and has to face a tax inspector saying that that policy is a non-qualifying one which is not exempt from tax. That could be ruinous. The Financial Secretary says that it has all been cleared with the industry. Frankly, however, the industry is not the problem. It is big enough to look after itself. The problem is the individual taxpayer hit by an adverse decision.<br><br>
As I said earlier, the courts, inspectors of taxes, tribunals and others are entitled to have regard to ministerial statements made during our proceedings. That is why I asked for clarification about what subsection (5) means. It is a crucial issue. With all due respect, what the Minister said may be true, but it has nothing to do with subsection (5). The Minister's suggestion that the exemption was in subsection (5) caused me to leap to my feet in the belief that the Minister was giving way. We are supposedly here to represent individual taxpayers above all else, so it is crucial that they understand whether their policies will be covered.<br><br>
The Minister then gave us a list of policies qualifying under the clause. Is that a complete list? He mentioned those covering accident, sickness, disability and unemployment. If it is as clear as that, why is it not obvious in the Bill? If Parliament means anything, our wishes should be built into legislation so that the public know where they stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understood the Minister's reply, he said that the clause dealt with insurance policies taken to cover the contingency of becoming unemployed—that is, problems arising from unemployment itself rather than from the fact of being unemployed. I fear that such policies will turn out to be salary replacement payment schemes that might lead to abuse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that by their nature all insurance policies are continent, but I am unsure whether the schemes will lead to abuse. The intention of both sides of the Committee is that someone insuring against unemployment, who draws on the policy, should not be taxed. As I understand him, the Financial Secretary is telling us that such policies will not be taxed. Abuse may occur when a policy is set up for a raft of reasons—some qualifying, others not. Much will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
then depend on the term "significant", which is why I pressed the Financial Secretary on that.<br><br>
My cental point is that if Parliament intends some policies to be covered and others not to be covered, would it not be better to say it in a way that we all understand? With all due repect to those who drafted subsection (5), it is not immediately clear what it states and it certainly does not say what the Minister has suggested. My interpretation—based on a plain reading—is more plausible than the Minister's, though the Minister has the advantage of being able to speak to drafters and the hundreds of thousands of people who sit behind him to advise him.<br><br>
I am a mere lawyer reading the provision and trying to imagine how I would advise clients if I were asked what it meant. I cannot find any reference to savings or investment, so I cannot understand how it means what the Minister says that it means. Perhaps I have missed something. This is a serious point; I am not quibbling. We all want to encourage people to insure against risks; to achieve that, there must be certainty in the law, which we currently do not have.<br><br>
The Minister said that advice could be sought from the Inland Revenue. The industry does that, but it is not the industry that causes me the problem—if it makes a mistake, we as members of the public will pay for it ultimately, but the industry is well equipped to look after itself. I am concerned about the individual taxpayer.<br><br>
The Minister referred to pre-transaction rulings, which we believe have great potential. We are in the infancy of that development of tax law, and people must be clear about what legal status a pre-transaction ruling has. The Opposition—as my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) and I have made clear over the past couple of years—would like to develop that area of the law. We think that pre-transaction rulings could be extremely useful, particularly for corporate taxpayers. There is greater difficulty as far as individual taxpayers are concerned, simply because of the numbers involved. However, because the issue is in its infancy, the Minister cannot rely with any confidence on pre-transaction rulings with regard to clause 134 for individual taxpayers. Yes, the insurance industry can obtain rulings and helpful advice and will no doubt act in the best of faith. I am concerned, however, that a taxpayer could take out a policy in good faith, draw substantial sums under that policy and then find that, to everyone's surprise, there is a substantial tax liability because somewhere in the country, an inspector of taxes has looked at subsection (5) and said that it does not say what the Minister claims it says. The inspector might disagree with the Inland Revenue's interpretation and tell the individual that he has to pay tax. That would be disastrous.<br><br>
I return to the point where I came in. I am sure that the Minister does not want to read again headlines such as,
<br><blockquote><p>"Tory chaos over tax climbdown"</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"Clarke contradicts Major on mortgage cover"</p></blockquote>
or
<br><blockquote><p>"Clarke does U-turn on mortgage protection".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
The best way to stop such chaos and confusion is to try to get the law right in the first place. That is why I have raised the matter. With respect, although I agree with what he is trying to do, the Minister will have to do a lot better if there is to be certainty in the law and if we are not to run the substantial risk that someone somewhere will take out a policy only to discover that he will have to pay tax, when he believed all along that he was not going to have to pay tax. For those reasons, I press the Minister again to explain the meaning of subsection (5).<br><br>
Subsection (5) makes me wonder whether, instead of taking two or three examples—and my hon. Friends have used others—I would have been wiser to go through the clause line by line in order to get the Minister to say exactly what the clause does. There are great difficulties ahead. I am not being difficult, but we need certainty, which we do not have at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify one point for the benefit of the Committee. It relates to what the Minister said about payments that are made by companies into certain insurance policies to benefit their employees. If I heard him correctly, he said that such policies would not be taxable if the employee contributed to the premiums. Will the Minister clarify whether that is the case? If so, the provision will cause many real-world problems.<br><br>
I know of numerous employers who give, as part of a salary and benefits package, permanent health insurance and long-term insurance benefits to their employees and who do not require them to make any contributions to the premiums. We would create a bureaucratic nightmare if, in the future, employees had to make some small contribution to the premiums to ensure that they would not be taxed on the benefits if they required them. I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central for raising the question of clarification. Clause 134 has been included in the Bill to deal with a matter about which there is uncertainty. That is why we asked the Revenue to help us draft a clause that would put the intention on risk-type policies beyond doubt. The hon. Gentleman asked about clause 134(5), so I shall have another go at trying to satisfy him on that point.<br><br>
Exemption is limited to policies where the insurance company could make a loss on an individual policy. There must be a risk—this is risk-type insurance. The subsection would exclude savings or investment policies from the exemption and has nothing to do with the qualifying policy regime. The insurance companies will have a clear idea of what risk insurance policy is.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I take seriously what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central says. He made an important point about <i>caveat emptor</i>—let the buyer beware. People will seek advice from many insurance sellers—companies, intermediaries, agents and others—and it is important that they receive good information. That puts an onus on insurance companies to make what people are buying absolutely clear to them when they take out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0476">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
insurance. The hon. Gentleman suggested that the sole responsibility for that should be put on the Government's shoulders.<br><br>
In more regular insurance, such as household or car insurance, people sometimes take out policies that turn out not to do what they expected—perhaps they did not read the fine print as closely as they should have done. That is a problem in any complex transaction in which people are not always crystal clear about the end result. I shall, however, raise with the Inland Revenue the possibility of it producing one of its helpful guides on the matter so that people can have access to layman's information of a quality that enables them to make judgments. I hope that that removes the question of risk for the policy buyer.<br><br>
Let us, however, turn the argument round. If I think that I might be exposed to a risk, I might seek a policy to cover it. That puts an onus on me as the potential purchaser to ensure that the product does what I want. The important point is, however, to ensure that when the risk occurs and the holder calls on the policy—as set out in the list—to deliver against the risk, it does so tax free, as set out in the clause. I admit that the list is not complete. Policies come in many guises, but the clause is drafted in generic terms to avoid excluding those whose benefits we seek to exempt. I am grateful that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central agrees that we should encourage people to consider such risks.<br><br>
I hope that my remarks give the hon. Gentleman some comfort. I take his remarks seriously. It is important that people outside have a clear idea of what we are doing. I hope that we can, after conversation with the Revenue, provide layman's information to assist those who want to purchase such a policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary. His helpful concession that the Revenues will publish information that can be understood by laymen is useful. Some insurance policies will always push at the frontiers, and there will always be doubts about them.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) raised an interesting point. I accept that the doctrine of caveat emptor must apply when one buys a policy. Members of the Committee canvassed the possibility of its applying to tax law. We are, however, here to avoid that and should not tell the population to beware of the law because we do not know what it means. The Financial Secretary, like his predecessors, is sympathetic to the point. It is a matter of regret that the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) is not here, as it is a theme to which he returns often, although I think that he has been told to keep quiet during our proceedings this year.<br><br>
Sooner or later we shall have to grasp the nettle and try to say what we mean in the tax law. I welcome the concession, but I foresee great difficulty in having a corpus of law and a corpus of help and guidance to explain it. I know that we cannot unite the two today, but the debate has usefully clarified what is meant to be covered. Above all, we have identified the problems that will be encountered as successive complex provisions are introduced into the body of tax law. From
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
what the Minister said it is possible to infer—although I do not think it was what he meant—that the population is increasingly being put into a position where caveat emptor applies to the interpretation of tax law.<br><br>
That would be a bad thing, from which the only people to profit would be tax advisers. It is not the business of the House of Commons to channel and create business for those who make a living advising on tax. We should aim for simplification and clarity if at all possible. The debate has been a very useful start down that long road.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment tackles a specific problem with the clause, which otherwise is welcome because it extends the tax relief available for vocational training. In particular, it assists people who, in mid career, wish to take or need to take a vocational course to help them get back into employment or simply to brush up the skills that they already have.<br><br>
The principle underlying the clause is good, especially in its differential application to people of mature years. Once people are well into a career it is reasonable to suppose that their increased commitments make paying for a vocational course—with time taken out from work either voluntarily or involuntarily—that much more difficult. Such people are likely to have a family and a mortgage. They are also likely to find it more difficult to lower their standard of living than would be the case for people who go straight from school through higher education and then into a vocational course.<br><br>
Like most Conservative Members, I am always reluctant to extend tax reliefs or to introduce new reliefs. In this instance, however, the tax relief would be justified until such time as the whole tax structure can be simplified and all tax reliefs done away with. Until that time comes, we must ensure that the tax reliefs work properly.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0477">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
The proposed tax relief is designed to assist people at the age of 30 and over. Amendment No. 151 would reduce the age limit to 27. It is designed to help people taking postgraduate courses, especially business school courses, in mid career. In fact, the amendments were suggested by the London business school. Business school postgraduate degrees—MBAs—typically are taken by people with a certain amount of prior business experience. It is recognised that someone with practical experience at work benefits most from that degree. It is designed to enhance the skills and capabilities of employed people and to enable them, when they go back to work after having taken the degree, to progress more effectively in their careers to the advantage of the company that they rejoin or any new company.<br><br>
The average age of people on a London business school MBA programme is 28 years, not 30 years. The age at which people take the decision to abandon their employment and make a significant financial sacrifice—and to put their families through that—is slightly below 30. London business school and other business schools have found that that is about the right age to take an MBA. When students graduate they come back on to the job market the right side of 30.<br><br>
My amendment would provide greater flexibility in clause 135.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's remarks with interest and a fair degree of sympathy. He said that the average age was just below 30—presumably about 27. Some people on courses at the London business school may be only 25 or 26 but have families and have had similar experience. Under his amendment they will not qualify, whereas those sitting next to them will? Is not he creating an anomaly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am creating an anomaly. Indeed, the clause, as it stands, creates an anomaly. I am trying to relieve some of the worst effects of that anomaly. The average age is 28 and the London business school MBA is a two-year course. The age of 27 was deliberately picked to enable people who start the course to get tax relief. The reason for that—from the point of view of the London business school—is partly to encourage people to take an MBA later rather than earlier in their careers. Some people take business school degress straight after their first degree and some people benefit from that. But many of the business schools believe that that should not be encouraged. The idea is to enable people to have three or four years' business experience before going on to the degree course.<br><br>
Although I accept what the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) said about my amendment creating an anomaly, it does have certain benefits. It makes the tax relief more effective than the relief provided in the clause as presently worded.<br><br>
My second two amendments are designed to extend the tax relief to two-year courses. The reason for that is essentially to do with the London business school and certain postgraduate degree courses. Some postgraduate degree courses are one year. An MBA course typically lasts one year. The majority of business schools in this country have one-year MBA programmes. The two that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
do not are the London business school and the Manchester business school, both of which have adopted the American model of a two-year MBA programme.<br><br>
I must admit a certain prejudice, because many years ago I did the London business school two-year MBA programme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: And it shows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It is a compliment to the London business school.<br><br>
To my mind the advantages of a two-year MBA programme are substantial. That is certainly the view of the London business school. The first year of an MBA programme is the theoretical side of business administration; the second year is more practically-oriented. That is a considerable benefit.<br><br>
However, the clause introduces an element of discrimination between different MBA programmes, and may apply to other post-graduate courses. If a student—aged 27 if my amendment is accepted, or aged 30 if not—is considering which MBA course to study, there will be a financial incentive to pursue a one-year programme. That will be a fiscal incentive in addition to the incentive to take a shorter time out of one's career.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
In practice, the incentive should operate the other way—to encourage a student considering an MBA programme to pursue the best course for his and his employer's requirements. A two-year course already requires a greater financial sacrifice in terms of earnings, so I want to ask my hon. Friend whether introducing an additional fiscal disincentive makes any sense.<br><br>
The clause is also anti-competitive. Business schools, more than almost any other form of higher education, exist in a highly competitive market. The London business school is a high earner of fees from overseas students. Many of its students come from overseas and pay full-cost fees. It also earns overseas fees for its courses and other activities. A two-year course that discriminates against United Kingdom students should be deplored. It would make it more difficult for the London business school to recruit our students and the balance will be wrong. I strongly urge my hon. Friend therefore to broaden the clause to allow post-graduate degree courses to qualify for two years' tax relief.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 154 and 155 are designed to deal with the increasingly popular way of taking postgraduate courses in people's mature years—on a part time or release basis. The clause requires full-time attendance: the amendments would enable serious part-time courses and those involving release from work to study in colleges to qualify for tax relief. There is a strong case for doing that. Full-time courses are desirable but students may have family or work commitments that make it difficult to take one or two years out of their careers.<br><br>
A part-time course is a viable option but it is a harder option for many people to embark upon. Part-time degrees typically demand hard work and commitment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0478">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
from students. They also require commitment and understanding from employers. The reality, however, for many people who are studying part-time MBA programmes is that their employers do not support them. Employers may tolerate a reduced time commitment from their employees, but that is often considered enough.<br><br>
Extending the scope of relief to enable part-time students to benefit could open up opportunities for a range of people whom the country needs to be enhancing their skills. It would encourage them to take such courses and make it financially possible for them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following what the hon. Gentleman says with close interest. What costings has he done, if he has been able to do any—I appreciate that that may have been difficult—on two aspects of his amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Regrettably I do not have the ability to be able to do those costings myself. However, on the back of an envelope it is clear that costs would be minimal, mainly because the number of MBA students who would qualify or who would want to take the option up would be minimal. We must exclude MBA students who currently receive grants—a significant proportion do, through bursaries, standard Government grants or from research councils. A significant proportion of part-time students enjoy support from their employers and so do not qualify for the tax relief, either.<br><br>
Thus, a fairly narrowly defined group of students would qualify and costs would therefore be small. Of course, numbers would grow if the reliefs were applied more widely than just to postgraduate courses; it might be undesirable to restrict them to such courses, in which case the tax effects would be greater. Even so, we are talking about very small sums, given the total tax reliefs already in the system, and they would be extremely well spent.<br><br>
One of the great problems in this country, in all areas of activity, is the weakness and quality of management. Anything that encourages more people to be up to date on management skills and to understand the technicalities of management and the advances that have been made is to be welcomed. If we can do that benignly, through the fiscal changes that I have proposed, the Committee ought to be prepared to do it. The benefit would be far in excess of the cost to the Exchequer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) said about the importance of business schools, in particular the London business school, and I strongly support the Government's decision to extend tax relief for vocational training.<br><br>
I want to talk about legal vocational training. As members of the Committee will know, I have been a partner in a solicitor's practice for more than 25 years. But it is not in my capacity as senior partner of the City firm of Beachcroft Stanleys that I raise the point; it is as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
a graduate of the College of Law, which provides extensive training, particularly for people who face a mid-career change. That will be of enormous interest to Opposition Members.<br><br>
A slight misunderstanding has arisen, which I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary can clarify. Many people are deterred from a mid-career change and the training that that involves by the cost of such training and their ineligibility to receive public financial assistance. However, there appears to be an uncertainty with regard to a person who is eligible to apply for public financial assistance, such as a career development loan, but who decides not to apply for such assistance—for various reasons— or who, having applied for such assistance, does not receive it. Will my hon. Friend assure us that such an individual would none the less be entitled to seek tax relief on the cost of a qualifying vocational training course?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham on the care and courtesy with which he has tabled his amendments. He has shown, by his careful proposals, that he regards the clause as an important contribution to the cause of advancing training.<br><br>
In reviewing the amendments, and before I answer the question asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West, it will be helpful if I say a word or two about the purpose of the clause. The scheme that it sets out arose from the representations people made to the Treasury about how they could get some assistance if, after a period of work in which they had developed a career and acquired skills, they found that there were no further opportunities in their present employment. They asked how they could undergo a quick, intensive form of retraining to help them get back into the labour market with new skills as quickly as possible.<br><br>
We estimate that a tight group of about 20,000 people might benefit from the proposed relief. However, the burning desire expressed to us led us to see whether we could extend the tax treatment of vocational training relief and make it broader and rather different. Vocational training relief is targeted especially at those who are in work and want to gain vocational qualifications. The clause applies the mechanism to a broader range of training opportunities. It was designed to meet the needs of that narrow group of people who wanted to get back to work quickly.<br><br>
We costed the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, and the hon. Member for North Warwickshire was right to ask how much they would cost. We estimate that the age reduction proposed in amendment No. 151, together with the costs involved in the amendment dealing with part-time training, would add another £10 million to the £10 million already incurred by the relief.<br><br>
I want to give my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham a modicum of encouragement. He did not dwell too long on amendment No. 150, but I can tell him that I am happy to accept the point of drafting and clarification that it proposes. I see that I have brought a smile to his face. However, I fear that he may not smile so much when I come to deal, however courteously, with the rest of his amendments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0479">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
I cannot accept those amendments for the general reason that the relief proposed in the clause is as yet untried. It responds to a tightly focused group of people needing help. As with any new scheme, one needs to see how it works out before deciding whether any alteration is necessary in the future.<br><br>
Amendment No. 151 proposes a reduced age limit. Such limits are always a matter of where one draws the line, and there are always proponents of higher or lower limits. We reckoned that the age of 30 was a sensible compromise, covering people who may have started work at a relatively early age and who, depending on whether they are graduates or not, may have had seven or 10 years in the labour market. Such people would benefit from the clause's proposals. Lowering the age to 27 would mean that relief could be given to some people who had only recently commenced a career after costly, publicly financed education or training. Adopting an age limit of 27 would cause the clause to miss the group of people that we have in mind.<br><br>
I acknowledge that it is a matter of judgment. We have tried, by adopting a starting point at the age of 30, to strike a sensible balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is rightly dealing with costing and the important matter of to whom the provision will apply. Clause 136 will cost approximately £10 million: it gives substantial tax concessions to European economic area nationals. He rightly recognised the significant issues that his hon. Friend the Member for Fulham raised. Will he contrast the importance of this clause with that of clause 136?</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has taken us a little beyond this clause. We are not making concessions: we are not giving away anything new. We are merely regularising an existing position. I hope that he will reflect on that before we discuss clause 136.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My I press my hon. Friend further on the question of age? I accept that the decision about whether the age should be 30, 27 or somewhere between the two is a judgmental one. He rightly said that a person aged 27 could have just finished a postgraduate degree course and could become an eternal student. Sadly, that could also apply to people aged 30. Will he monitor the way in which the clause works to see whether it would make sense to review this provision later and adjust the age limit downwards? The age of 27 may be too low, but, given the average age of students taking these courses, the age of 30 may be too high.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember one of the original representations we received that sparked off this thinking. It referred to the mid-life crisis, which is an interesting phrase. Mid-life has a different meaning for different individuals. For some people it may mean the age of 40, 50 or 60, depending on how long they perceive their life span on this earth to be. It is a matter of judgment and my hon. Friend acknowledged that.<br><br>
We will monitor the position. My hon. Friend will be aware that the Department for Education and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
Employment consult more widely on training matters. The clause is tightly focused. That is the rock upon which I base my case. The clause is targeted at a narrow group of people, who, although they have a developed career, hit a problem and want to do intensive training and get back into the workplace quickly. I undertake, however, to keep the matter under close scrutiny, because, as with all our policies, we will want to ensure that it is effective.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 152 and 153 invite us to include two-year MBA courses for tax relief. I am not attracted to that for almost the same reasons as I gave on the matter of age. The original thesis applied to people who work intensively on a course of more than four weeks and up to a year's duration and then get back into the labour market, as opposed to those who want longer-term training. Bearing in mind that the relief is for people with their own resources, I wonder whether, based on the representations that we received, two-year courses were what people had in mind. The costs of a two-year MBA course are considerable: £20,000 a year, plus housing, living and travelling expenses. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham attested to that.<br><br>
I want to make it absolutely clear that one-year MBA courses will qualify for help under the procedures. So an individual could receive a benefit if the MBA were his chosen training course. But I do not think that that is what those who suggested this measure to us had in mind, so I am not attracted to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to push my hon. Friend on this matter, but he admitted that one-year MBA courses will qualify under the clause. That may have been an unintended consequence of the way in which the clause was drawn up, although I am sure that my hon. Friend greatly welcomes it. Does that mean, however, that someone taking an MBA at Cranfield will have a fiscal advantage over someone taking an MBA at Manchester or London? The Government should not make fiscal judgments about which course someone should go on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose the reverse is true. Some institutions feel that they can complete an MBA in one year and others feel that they can do that in two. The relief is tightly focused on a particular group, and we obviously want to discover how it works out. The objective is to return people to the workplace as quickly as possible, but I doubt whether a two-year course—however good—will meet it. People asked us whether we could do something about the mid-life crisis when those who have had their first career, and with some skills, want to retrain and return to work quickly. The proposals target such people.<br><br>
I am not attracted to the amendments about part-time courses for the same reasons. They do not suggest the sense of immediacy of someone who wants to work intensively on his training to return to the workplace. For those and, again, for cost reasons, I cannot accept the amendments.<br><br>
I was delighted to hear my right hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West make his first contribution to the Committee's proceedings. I thank him for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0480">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
courtesy with which he spoke about the College of Law. The Government can confirm the college's interpretation of the Bill, which is that
<br><blockquote><p>"those who do not apply for a career development loan, like those who apply but are turned down, are entitled to claim vocational training relief."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that puts to rest the doubts that my right hon. Friend raised.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham for the thought and care with which he presented his amendments. It is always difficult to turn down sensible ideas, particularly when they are well argued by a colleague. Given the nature of the relief and the clause, however, I hope that he will understand my reluctance to accept his proposal. I shall keep it under close review, however, because it could be a beneficial and helpful addition to the way in which we help people to receive training. I am sure that it will be part of the wider review of training matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak at length on the amendments, but the debate has broadened to cover the wider issues in the clause.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary considers the clause to be an extension of previous reliefs to people who seek training. His remarks do not make it clear, however, whether it constitutes a second step in the process of developing and expanding the reliefs that are available to people in work who want a career break.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the hon. Gentleman aright? Was he talking about the extension of help for people in work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate from reading the Inland Revenue notice that the relief applies to and benefits not only people who are in work, but those who are not. That is an enormously welcome addition. I want to discover, however, whether the Government are involved in a process of extending relief. Cannot the Minister offer his hon. Friend the Member for Fulham encouragement and tell him that the Government will pursue such an extension, should it be available this time next year? Is that the intention behind the whole process? We all know that there is a skills deficit in this country and that we have to compete in the global market. The two best ways in which any country can do that is by providing the infrastructure that an economy needs and, most importantly, by providing education to create skills. We have been urging the Government to encourage people along those lines for many years. I hope that the Government now recognise that that is necessary.<br><br>
As part of his review of the process, will the Financial Secretary give the encouragement that the hon. Member for Fulham and others seek, and announce that in due course, as finances permit, the Government will make such reliefs available to a wider group of people, so that skills and education can be improved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read in my newspaper this morning that the Opposition Treasury team is now considering the best way to provide fiscal incentives for employers to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
offer training, without added cost to the Exchequer. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire has just advocated spending more money. I am delighted that, through the clause, the Government are able to put more money in, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that—for the very reason to which he alluded when he said "as finances permit"—I do not at this stage want to go beyond what we have proposed. That is precisely the explanation that I gave my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham. We want to see how it goes.<br><br>
The scheme is tightly focused and meets a specific need that was drawn to our attention by means of representations from those who had suffered the mid-life crisis of their work having to be changed and who desired to receive intensive training to get them back into work. That is our position. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems extraordinary that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire should suddenly advocate an extension of tax relief when resources permit, while at the same time, as <i>The Times</i> today reports:
<br><blockquote><p>"Gordon Brown, the Shadow Chancellor, has made clear that any start-up costs"—</p></blockquote>
for Labour's new training scheme—
<br><blockquote><p>"will have to be found by targeting existing resources more effectively. One option is to drop some of the existing training schemes."</p></blockquote>
We have witnessed an extraordinary diversion by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire from Labour's policy of not introducing further tax reductions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, he is angry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not in the least bit angry, but I despair at the way in which what was started by the hon. Member for Fulham as a sensible debate—it was going well and there had been valid contributions—has suddenly been turned by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) into political argy-bargy. I clearly asked the Financial Secretary a number of questions about what he proposed to do—that is all I did. If the hon. Gentleman reads the report of what I said, he will find that out. Perhaps he was not listening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is so upset by what I thought was an innocent intervention. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Clearly, it is a sensitive issue for those on the Labour Front Bench—and I can understand why. The hon. Gentleman may say that the matter is unimportant, but it is the lead news story in <i>The Times</i> this morning. The headline says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Blair scraps training 'tax on jobs'".</p></blockquote>
I think that we should be told whether the Labour party really plans to do that.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was rather nice to start a debate that ended up creating a considerable amount of heat.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0481">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
When I tabled the amendments I rather thought that they were uncontroversial and would prompt a quiet discussion. I did not realise that we would get into political argy-bargy. That is really rather encouraging.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for accepting amendment No. 150, which is a triumph of the draftsman's skill. I am sorry that he is not prepared to accept the other amendments. I was interested to hear him say that the cost would be 10 million. That is a significant amount of money but not a highly significant amount in terms of the total education budget. I understand why he would want to consider reducing the age limit and to think about part-time courses qualifying under the clause.<br><br>
On the question of the choice between a one-year course and a two-year course, however, we are dealing with a minimal amount of money—I would be surprised if it amounted to much more than £10,000, let alone £10 million. On the other hand, it will have a significant impact on two business schools, both of which have worldwide reputations. Indeed, there is a strong case for saying that their MBA programmes are the best in Europe, with the possible exception of the one at INSEAD. To discriminate through the tax system against those two schools and in favour of other business schools—which may be good in themselves, although they may not have so high a reputation—seems perverse.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary consider the matter carefully and perhaps table an amendment on Report—an amendment that would be relatively minor and cost-free—to allow business schools to compete on a level playing field, if only to sustain the reputation that this country has for excellence in business education?</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Financial Secretary a number of questions relating to the clause? Why is the clause in the Bill in the first place? I read the notes on clauses, but I cannot understand why the decision was made. Does it have anything to do with Regina <i>v.</i> Inland Revenue ex parte Commerzbank 1993? Can the Financial Secretary outline the costs? I understand that they will be £10 million rising to £20 million. How many individuals are projected to benefit from the clause in any one year? If the Financial Secretary has that information, it should be easy for him to give us an indication of the income profile of those who might benefit and to tell us to what extent most of the resources will go to relatively wealthy European economic area nationals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary tell the Committee how much the reliefs will cost in terms of lost revenue this year and in subsequent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
years, and why such a loss of revenue merits the priority that it has been accorded above other measures and above other moneys that the Government might spend on other things? Finally, if it is worth it on its own merits, why do we not extend this extension of reliefs to all foreign nationals? Why is it not equally worth extending this measure, perhaps to encourage investment and improve the mobility of labour, to all foreign nationals? Why are we targeting the EEA group of foreign nationals?<br><br>
I suspect that some manoeuvring is going on in the capital of the federal Europe and we will find ourselves under some developing legal constraint and we will be dictated to by the European legal system on how we should organise our personal income taxes. Is that not something of a threshold to have crossed when we have always been assured by the Government that the European Community has no competence over the management of income taxes in member states?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to support the first point made by the hon. Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin) in asking why the measure could not be extended to everyone, but he then drifted off into a weird Europhobe mini-rant. I was wondering how long the Finance Committee could survive before the issue that so divides the Conservative Party emerged. I would like the Financial Secretary to explain exactly who is covered. To my knowledge the EEA now covers only Norway; Switzerland refused as a result of a referendum to join the EEA. I do not understand why the poor Commonwealth citizens and the Republic of Ireland citizens are knocked out, to be replaced by the odd troll from Norway; nor do I understand why the other valuable foreigners working in this country from the United States and Japan cannot have the same tax treatment as would citizens in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Finally, next Wednesday I shall be participating in the opening of a Taiwanese plant in my constituency. The people working for the Taiwanese mission as diplomats do not have diplomatic status nor do they have any income tax relief. The question of their diplomatic status is a matter for the Foreign Office but it is quite normal in other countries for people acting as quasi-diplomats or working for other organisations to be given relief from paying income tax on a par with other diplomats.<br><br>
Given that there are 9,000 Taiwanese students in this country and that Taiwan is now one of our biggest trading partners in the far east, I hope that the Financial Secretary will tell us that he is minded to have discussions with his right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor about treating those who are accredited to the Taiwanese mission in London on a par with those accredited from countries with whom we have diplomatic status. This is a murky area. We need to have it on all fours. We need information on the countries covered and the number of nationals who might be included or excluded. I hope that we will get some clear answers from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Milton Keynes has more Japanese employers than any other part of the United Kingdom.

from Asia. Like the hon. Member for Rotherham, I should also like to know why the EEA category of overseas person has been singled out for the reliefs. We have a great deal of inward investment from Japan and North America, but I cannot think of a Norwegian company in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to reply to the debate, which will have covered the flags of all nations by the time we have finished.<br><br>
First, I shall describe what the clause attempts to achieve and the reasons for it. Most people who pay United Kingdom income tax are resident in the United Kingdom. Some people who live abroad pay United Kingdom tax on income that arises here. United Kingdom residents are entitled to personal allowances to set against their income. The rules for those who reside abroad are more complex. Some of those taxpayers are entitled to personal allowances in law, others are entitled to them under double taxation agreements with the country of residence, but others are not entitled to them. Personal allowances are available by statute to non-United Kingdom residents who are citizens of the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic, but not to citizens of other countries in the EEA. The special treatment of citizens of the Irish Republic and the Commonwealth reflects our close historical links with those countries, but in view of the development of the European single market, that provision is an anachronism.<br><br>
The clause will ensure that all EEA nationals receive personal allowances on the same basis as citizens of the Irish Republic and the Commonwealth. I was asked how many people the provision would affect. Our best estimate is 100,000 individuals. That shows that the group that the provision covers is narrow and tightly focused. The clause will end several inconsistencies in the current treatment of EEA nationals. For example, a Dutch person who pays United Kingdom tax on a United Kingdom pension will receive a personal allowance if he lives in the United Kingdom or in Holland, but often not if he lives in a third country for health reasons. By contrast, an Irish citizen would receive personal allowance wherever he lived. In anticipation of a challenge, and to treat all EEA nationals on the same basis—Ireland is, of course, part of the EEA—and to maintain our jurisdiction, the provision tries to regularise those matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefuly to my hon. Friend's comments. He said that the clause had been included in the Bill, "in anticipation of a challenge", and "to maintain our jurisdiction". If we change our legislation because we fear a challenge, however, we have lost jurisdiction. In those circumstances, the threat of a challenge is no different from a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend that the Government guard jealously their control over United Kingdom tax legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have lost it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that my hon. Friend has missed the point that an inconsistency already exists: one EEA
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
country and members of the Commonwealth are entitled to the allowances. We do not want to take away those privileges from our friends in the Commonwealth. There may be a legal challenge because of the inconsistency between the treatment of citizens of the Irish Republic—a member of the EEA—and other members of the EEA. It is sensible to anticipate such a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there a statutory or treaty requirement for the provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, there is no requirement, but given the inconsistency of the status of one EEA country—the Irish Republic and its citizens—we felt that the time had come to act. We anticipated that there could be a challenge, but we included the clause simply to regularise the situation. It does not change our supremacy in tax law. As I said a moment ago, we guard that most jealously.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend concerned about a challenge in the European court, which might make a judgment against us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come at a point from a slightly different perspective. All national laws have a nondiscriminatory provision in them because of the treaties to which we are signatories. That, in simple terms, is what the clause deals with—no more, no less.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to contradict what he has said before. In January 1996, the Inland Revenue was writing to people making claims such as these saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that the Treaty of Rome/EEA agreement does not require the UK to give personal allowance to all EEA nationals."</p></blockquote>
The Minister was saying that there was no reason for us to do that; now he says that there is concern about discrimination clauses. What is this all about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is having difficulty understanding what I say, I repeat what I told my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South, West (Mr. Legg) a moment ago. As far as the Community treaties are concerned all national laws have to be nondiscriminatory. That is why we have sought to do what we have. I am not aware of the dated correspondence quoted by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire. He knows that I will not discuss the affairs of individual taxpayers, so I am not going to comment on his intervention.<br><br>
The simple logic is that if citizens of the Irish Republic already enjoy a benefit, there could be a challenge. We sought to anticipate challenges waiting in the wings. It is good government to deal with inconsistency. Extension of the provision has been put forward for those reasons.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham asked why we do not extend the provision world wide. I am delighted that our number one status in inward investment is being retained as far as Rotherham is concerned. Were the hon. Gentleman true to his cause of following the social chapter, we might not be rejoicing in that opening.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh. Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to embarrass the hon. Gentleman into having to underscore once again his commitment to that expensive provision. I am doing him a favour by not giving way. In answer to his question about extending the clause world wide, the costs would be £150 million.<br><br>
With those remarks, and despite the probing of my hon. Friends, I commend the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have sat down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was asked by his hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, North how much this would cost, and he did not answer. Allow me. The measure will, according to the Red Book, table 5(1), line 15, cost £10 million in 1996–97 and £20 million the following year. It is regrettable that the Minister did not feel that he could give that answer but it is available for us all to read.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not specifically giving the figures. I thought that the amount had been put on the record by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention the £20 million.<br><br>
I asked the Minister about the influence of Regina <i>v.</i> Inland Revenue ex parte Commerzbank 1993, which has a bearing on the matter. He did not answer that either. Over recent years, many non-EU nationals have submitted claims that they were entitled to United Kingdom allowances against United Kingdom investment income tax withdrawn. Those claims seem to have been fuelled by the decision of the European Court of Justice that repaying supplement could not be denied to the United Kingdom branch of a German bank in the case that I have mentioned.<br><br>
Those arguments were further aided by the decision of the European Court of Justice in 1995 that the right of European Union nationals to work in member states without discrimination under article 48 of the Rome treaty prevents the tax laws of member states discriminating against non-nationals who live in one state and work in another. I refer to the case of Finanzamt Koln <i>v.</i> Schumacker.<br><br>
The Minister assures us that that is not being done under any pressure, that the Government merely anticipate a challenge waiting in the wings. Those two cases put enormous pressure on the Government. The Minister should make it clear to members of the Committee that that is why the provision has been included. I was told by accountants that in January, many claimants received letters agreeing claims for earlier years. The following paragraph from the Inland Revenue letter was sent in several letters to claimants.
<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that the Treaty of Rome/EEA Agreement does not require the United Kingdom to give personal allowances to all EEA nationals. However, taking all factors into account, including the Budget proposal to extend entitlement to personal allowances to EEA nationals, we have decided we can, based on the particular circumstances of this case, allow the claim to personal allowances."</p></blockquote>
But we still need to know why £10 million, and then £20 million, is being spent in this way. The Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
says only that there is anticipation of a challenge waiting in the wings. Will the Minister state clearly what he means? What is the ground for anticipating the challenge in the wings? He spoke of the need not to discriminate. Does he accept that the Government feel likely to be constrained by the Schumacher decision to do what they propose? If they do, why did the Inland Revenue write to people telling them that the Government do not feel likely to be constrained? Why did the Minister suggest that this was not being done under pressure from the European Court of Justice? There is a lack of clarity about why we are being asked to spend £10 million and £20 million on those people over a number of years. The Minister has simply not answered that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's line of questioning although, of course, he is not telling the Committee that his party would do any differently if it were in office. Perhaps he can tell us. Can he also explain his point about some claims apparently having been allowed prior to the legislation being enacted? Is he suggesting that we implement a retrospective clause because when court rulings are implemented by the European Court of Justice they tend to be retrospective to the date from which the treaty provisions, or the appropriate regulations or directives, came into force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need justification for the clause from Government lawyers. I am trying to elicit precisely that from the Financial Secretary. Until this legal advice is available, it will be difficult to accept that the Minister has justified his proposals. Spending £20 million for something that he admits we do not need to do—anticipating something that might be waiting in the wings—is just not good enough. It is no reason to spend money so freely, without adequate consideration. The Financial Secretary, is a Tory. We should be seeking financial restraint as a Financial Secretary in a Tory Government. He has provided no justification whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What would the Opposition do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a Labour Government had £20 million to spend we could consider carefully whether there were not better ways of spending it. Only a few moments ago the hon. Member for Fulham made various suggestions about how the money could be spent adequately in this country. If there is money about and the Financial Secretary wants to throw it at non-EEA nationals let him justify doing so. He has not yet done that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed to hear the hon. Member for North Warwickshire go on in that style. It suggests that there is a hidden agenda. Our Community treaties—whatever our views on Europe, we recognise that we have signed a treaty—include antidiscrimination provisions. That lies at the heart of the measure. I can only draw from the rhetoric of the hon. Gentleman that his party, which I used to believe was the repository of concern about discrimination, is no longer the repository for that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0484">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, no. Let me reply. I want to pick my way through what the hon. Member for North Warwickshire said.<br><br>
I can only assume that the hon. Gentleman's party is rowing back from the responsibility of dealing with discrimination matters. That is what he suggested in his comments. The hon. Gentleman asked about the Schumacher case in February 1995 and whether that required European Community members to grant personal allowances to non-residents. I believe that that was the full weight of his comments. The hon. Gentleman may care to note that the answer is yes, but only in the very limited circumstances in which someone cannot benefit from personal allowances in any country because all or most of his income comes from a member state other than his state of residence. That is a problem elsewhere in Europe in countries with many frontier workers who live in one member state and commute to work in another. That is not a problem in the United Kindom.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the Commerzbank case. I hope that my comment will help my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, North. We believe that nothing in that decision in terms of European Community law would require us to extend personal allowances and tax credits to all European Community or EEA nationals. There has been no litigation on that to date. In the handful of other cases in which the European Court of Justice considered income tax laws of member states, the court stressed that the power to make tax legislation is firmly in the hands of member states. I hoped that I would not have to go into detail and paraphrased my earlier comments, but it may help my hon. Friend if I put those words on the record.<br><br>
The Government are equally firmly committed to keeping control of the United Kingdom's tax legislation, as I also said to my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, North. We are introducing the measure not because of compulsion but because some EC nationals have suggested that our rules on personal allowances are discriminatory because the nationals of one member of the EEA—the Republic of Ireland—enjoy that facility and others do not. We listen to what people say and it seemed sensible to regularise the position.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire chastises and says that a cost is attached. Yes, but there could be a cost saving in not having to indulge in costly legal proceedings. We are pleased to regularise the situation and address the non-discrimination point in the clause. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will clarify on behalf of his party that he also believes in non-discrimination and put his position beyond doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, Mr. O'Brien?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, Mr. Hill. I have been asked a question and I am happy to clarify my party's position on discrimination. The Financial Secretary has given various reasons, which seem to shift with each comment. He seems now to have jumped to the issue of discrimination and is trying to turn it on us, but he has still not provided justification. He told us in an earlier
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
intervention why we should not extend the provision to non-EEA nationals such as the Japanese—his hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) had proposed that it should be extended to the USA and other countries. He seems to think that there is justification for discrimination here. He has not justified why EEA nationals must have the extension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am about to finish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask a question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Go on then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the measure were not agreed, how would the hon. Gentleman explain to a Spaniard why he could not have the same provision as an Irish national?</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary keeps telling us that the matter has nothing to do with obligations under the treaty of Rome or any EEA agreement. The Government have repeatedly written letters to taxpayers saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that the Treaty of Rome/EEA Agreement does not require the UK to give personal allowances to all EEA nationals".</p></blockquote>
So why are we spending £20 million to ensure that the allowance is extended to relatively few people? Is the agreement reciprocal? Will British people in those other countries benefit from reciprocity of the allowances that we appear to want to extend to non-resident EEA nationals? Will the Financial Secretary guarantee that every other country involved will provide similar allowances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for other Governments, only for the United Kingdom. We already make the allowances available to citizens of the Irish Republic and members of the Commonwealth. Not giving allowances to other EEA citizens is potentially discriminatory. The simplest way to deal with the issue is to put it beyond doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons advanced for introducing the change is to save potential legal costs in the event of a challenge. Might the Government still incur legal costs in the event of a challenge that the allowances should have been available in previous years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is always that possibility. [Hon. Members: "Oh".] Many cliams have been outstanding for several years while legal advice has been sought. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question, which helps to clarify our view that it would be unfair to deny such a claim.<br><br>
The logic of the argument rests on the simple historic fact that one member state of the EEA—the Irish Republic—already enjoys the privilege. Not providing it to others is potentially discriminatory. We are dealing simply and straightforwardly with that issue in respect of our treaty obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to put the debate in its proper context. My hon. Friend the Minister has tacitly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0485">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
admitted that European treaties now have jurisdiction over income tax matters in member states. There would be no possibility of any legal challenge if that were not the case. Just as our industrial relations laws are being eroded by sex equality legislation in the European Union, our income tax law is being interfered with on the grounds of national distinction between different EC or EEA nationals.<br><br>
The phoney anger of Labour Members about the cost of the tax relief rings hollow, given their determination—particularly that of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire—to drag us kicking and screaming into monetary union as fast as possible. The hon. Gentleman often told people that. He and his party are dragging the country along that path as fast as any member of the Government. There is no purpose in Conservative Members voting with a phoney Opposition on this measure because the power has passed from this House to European Community institutions which direct what happens.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to put the Question, but if the hon. Gentleman has something significant to say, please continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have I ever stood up, Mr. Hill, without something deeply significant to say?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shall we take a vote?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.<br><br>
I rise partly in response to the last intervention because we have moved quickly from the social chapter to EMU. In a way, the hon. Member for Colchester, North makes a fair point. As we see in the report on excessive regulations imposed on British industry in the past four or five years, there is often an excess of anticipatory zealotry by the Government who impose new regulations or there is a loss of revenue to the Government. In my experience of Europe, no other Government would be as generous to other members of the European Union and countries in the EEA. Until we are challenged, I do not understand why the measure is necessary. I urge again that the contribution of people outside the EEA to our economy should be recognised on all fours with citizens of the Irish Republic, other Commonwealth countries and EEA member states.</span></p>

EXEMPTIONS FOR CHARITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 97, line 21, after "Kingdom," insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(iib) from tax under Case V of Schedule D in respect of income consisting in any such dividend or other distribution of a company not resident in the United Kingdom as would be chargeable to tax under Schedule F if the company were so resident,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following: New clause 17—<i>Charities: general</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) In subsection (1)(e) of section 505 of The Taxes Act 1988 the word 'either' shall be omitted</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) At the end of that subsection there shall be inserted 'or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(iii) in the case of a trade not within (i) or (ii) above the profits assessable under case 1 of Schedule D for the accounting period do not exceed £25,000 or where the accounting period is for a period of less than 12 months, the profits assessable do not exceed £25,000 proportionately reduced.'.".</p></blockquote>
New clause 18—<i>Taxation of covenanted donations to charities</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>". In section 338 of the Taxes Act 1988 there shall be inserted the following subsection.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>`(8) Any company which is wholly owned by a charity may elect that a covenanted donation to that charity shall be treated for the purposes of this section as having been paid in the accounting period immediately preceding that in which the payment was made provided that notice of election is made to an Inspector of Taxes within two years of the end of the accounting period in which the payment was made.'.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a change in the bowling.<br><br>
The Committee will know that charities are exempted from tax on most of their income provided that income is applied for charitable purposes. Existing statutory definitions of what income is exempted are restrictive. By extra-statutory concession, the types of income exempted have been widened in practice. The clause will realise that concession.<br><br>
With regard to overseas income, the clause will exempt those incomes that arise abroad that would have been exempt if they had arisen in the United Kingdom. However, as the Bill is drafted, that will not be achieved in one respect—overseas dividend income will not be exempted. That exclusion was unintentional, and the amendment will correct the oversight. As a result, charity dividend income will be treated consistently whether it arises in the United Kingdom or overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to discuss the two new clauses. Members of the Committee might ask whether charities are exempt from tax. The answer is, yes and no. Charities can achieve tax exemption, but to do so they have to work their way carefully through some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0486">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
complex tax legislation. I shall draw the Committee's attention to the relevant legislation.<br><br>
Section 505 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 sets out the income that a charity holds that is exempt from tax. To achieve taxation exemption on trading income one must comply with paragraph (e)(i), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the trade is exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the charity".</p></blockquote>
Sub-paragraph (ii) requires that
<br><blockquote><p>"the work in connection with the trade is mainly carried out by beneficiaries of the charity."</p></blockquote>
Many trading activities of small charities in particular do not fall within that tight definition.<br><br>
If charities are aware of the full implications of those requirements, they must find another route to achieve tax exemption for their trading income. That is contained in section 338 of the Income and Corporation and Taxes Act 1988. That section provides for deeds of covenant to be paid from trading companies, which reduces their tax liability. Charities that are well organised and can pay for professional advice often structure their activities in that way; they set up a separate trading company from which covenants are paid. However, even that route can cause charities problems.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
I shall describe some of the problems that can arise from the legislation. A charity can carry out minor trading activities—it may not even regard them as trading activities—and incur a tax liability. For example, a charity that provides sailing voyages to disadvantaged boys and girls offered spare places to adults for a fee. The profit from selling those places was argued to be non-taxable. The Inland Revenue did not consider the sale of those places to be a primary purpose of the charity, which found, surprisingly, that it had a tax liability for those very small sums of money.<br><br>
Many minor activities are covered by the legislation. For example, if a community village hall that is run by a charity operates a bar, the profits that arise from it are taxable. As hon. Members who are involved with small charities will know, many charities do not have the resources to pay for professional advice about how to structure their activities so as to avoid tax liabilities.<br><br>
I mentioned the covenant route for avoiding tax liabilities that is open to charities. A charity would have to set up a subsidiary company—</span></p>
