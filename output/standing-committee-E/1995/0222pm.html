	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following: New clause 17—	<i>Charities: general</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) In subsection (1)(e) of section 505 of The Taxes Act 1988 the word 'either' shall be omitted</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) At the end of that subsection there shall be inserted 'or</p></blockquote>

New clause 18—	<i>Taxation of conventional donations to charities</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>". In section 338 of the Taxes Act 1988 there shall be inserted the following subsection.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>`(8) Any company which is wholly owned by a charity may elect that a convenanted donation to that charity shall be treated for the purposes of this section as having been paid in the accounting period immediately preceding that in which the payment was made provided that notice of election is made to an Inspector of Taxes within two years of the end of the accounting period in which the payment was made.'.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned for lunch, I was talking about some of the problems that charities face inadvertently not meeting the requirements set out in section 505E of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. They either fail to meet the primary purposes test in paragraph (e)(i) or the beneficiaries' test in paragraph (e)(ii). I provided a couple of examples before lunch of charities' problems and their activities that are subject to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue and the Charity Commission have foreseen the problems and have proposed that charities set up trading subsidiaries. For many small companies, however, that process consumes time and effort and necessitates professional advisers. If a trading subsidiary is set up, its tax relief is then obtained under section 338 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. To achieve such relief the subsidiary has to pay a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>476</span>
deed of covenant back to the charity. Again, that process often causes practical difficulties for charities, which have to guess the amount of profit in the subsidiary before the year ends so that they can make a deed of covenant payment to cover that profit and eliminate the possibility of paying tax. Thus many charities have to go in for guesswork and will usually overestimate the size of the deed of covenant. Further dealings with the Inland Revenue are required to sort out the overdeduction of tax when the deed of covenant has been set at a higher rate than the taxable profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Charities have to be clear about the differences that sometimes arise between accounting periods and periods for taxation. An example has been brought to my attention of a charity doing as the Inland Revenue suggested and setting up a trading subsidiary which subsequently made up its accounts for 18 months—meaning an 18-month accounting period. That meant a tax accounting period for the first 12 months followed by another tax accounting period for six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being laymen, not tax experts, people running the charity did not understand the situation and made only one payment under a deed of covenant at the end of the 18—month period. That is not uncommon. A mistake was made as their deed of payment covenant did not cover the first 12 months' trading so the whole of the profit for that period was subject to tax. That is another difficulty that charities can encounter when they try to make arrangements under current legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My two new clauses would circumvent those problems. The first provides for charities to have up to £25,000 worth of trading income exempt from tax. Under those circumstances, charities would not have to set up trading companies or to worry about ancillary activities that may lead to tax liabilities. There would be a 	<i>de minimis</i> limit of £25,000 which would help many charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, new clause 18, which relates to section 338 of the Taxes Act 1988, provides a period of grace for charities with trading subsidiaries that opt for deeds of covenant. Instead of having to estimate the amount of the deed of covenant that they must pay in an accounting period to cover profits, charities would have an extra 12 months in which to determine the amount and could use it precisely to cover the profits in their trading subsidiaries. The new clauses would ensure that charities did not have corporation tax liabilities on their trading activities. That is what everyone wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several charities have made representations to me on the important issues that the new clauses raises. Those include the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which represents more than 670 charities, the United Kingdom branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature and Help the Aged. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General will know that the regulation task force has discussed the issue. I hope that he can suggest solutions to the problems that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 17 proposes that a charity's taxable trading income should be exempt from tax if it does not exceed £25,000 in an accounting period. As
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>477</span>
my hon. Friend said, charities already enjoy generous tax treatment on most of their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned that a charity's trading income is exempt if it is related to its primary purpose, and there are many examples of that. If a school, hospital, theatre or opera house is a charity, as many are, the trading activity of receiving fees for its services or performances renders its trading activity as a whole exempt from tax. Trading activities are, furthermore, exempt if the charity mainly employs its beneficiaries. There are many familiar examples of that, such as workshops for the blind. Trading profits in that case are exempt. It is important to make it clear at the outset that investment and other forms of income are not the only ones to be exempt—the trading income that I have mentioned is exempt up to any limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend gave examples of unfairness and borderline cases, including that of a sailing school for disadvantaged people. If that is a trading activity and is conducted on a fee-paying basis it will be exempt because it is the charity's primary purpose. He mentioned the fact that spare places in the boats might be filled by members of the public. Trading profits from that source would be taxable, although provision exists to make them exempt if they are 	<i>de minimis</i> or constitute a small part—perhaps 10 per cent.—of the overall trading activity. That is helpfully set out in an Inland Revenue booklet called "Trading by Charities", which I commend to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the example of a village hall with a bar or refreshment facilities. That would fall to be taxed. In that case, the bar is not so much incidental to the trade of the village hall as the very trade that is carried on, which would be taxable. The charity commissioners are vigilant in ensuring that charities, however small, do not provide social drinking facilities and claim that that is, in itself, a charitable purpose. That is obviously not charitable, but it also provides unfair competition to those who run nearby pubs or restaurants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must always try to balance our aim of assisting charities—which enjoy substantial tax-exempt privileges—with the need to support the interests of businesses and fair competition. I am sure that my hon. Friend will know of the campaign that is run by the Federation of Small Businesses, which has complained about the extent of charities' tax advantages. He may well have read its booklet, entitled "Trading in a Jungle of Unfair Competition", in which the federation draws attention to the fact that, for instance, charity shops are substantially relieved from paying business rates. There is a mandatory 80 per cent. relief, which is frequently topped up to 100 per cent. by local authorities. Throughout the country, the total rate relief is probably in the order of £400 million. Although I cannot accept all the federation's complaints—indeed, some of them were claimed by the charities to be inaccurate—nevertheless there is something in its argument. We must not so upset the rules of competition that we put small businesses in high streets and elsewhere at substantial disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>478</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have introduced the £25,000 	<i>de minimis</i> so that the level of activities is small. The charity commissioners and the Inland Revenue suggest setting up a trading company as the vehicle by which to get round the problem of non-primary trading activities. More sophisticated charities are taking that route, while very small charities are penalised for having ancillary activities that are inadvertently subject to corporation tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult to define what a small business is, but certainly plenty of small businesses in my constituency make less than £25,000 profit a year. In some cases, they already feel disadvantaged by the tax-exempt status of some charities that trade in competition with them, either by the provision of services and facilities or through high street charity shops. We owe it to both sides to keep the present situation stable. I am not inclined to accept new clause 17 because it would, at a stroke, exempt from tax all the trading activities of charities as of right, regardless of the nature or location of their trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I explained that charities' trading activities are exempt if they are carried out as a primary purpose of a charity or by those who are mainly beneficiaries of a charity. My hon. Friend also drew attention to the other means whereby charities can set up trading subsidiaries and then remit the profits under a deed of covenant to the parent charity, thus avoiding tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 18, which was also tabled by my hon. Friend, goes further and would make things easier for the charitable sector. He correctly described the way in which companies can covenant their profits to parent charities under rules that are not unique to the charitable sector, but which apply to all companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present arrangements, it may be risky for them to donate all their profits; frequently they decide to leave at least some of the profits in the subsidiary company to cover future eventualities. If they want to donate all their profits, the precise figure may not be known in a specific year of account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of an accounting year, the amount of the profits should be known, at least with a high degree of approximation. A deed of covenant can then be drawn up to donate those profits to the parent company. It is common practice to err on the generous and optimistic side when deciding what the final taxable profits will be. They can be adjusted downwards retrospectively if that estimate proves to be too high. That works reasonably well in practice. The new clause proposes that companies should be able to defer making those donations up to 12 months after the end of their accounting period. I wonder whether many charities will want to do that in practice, because they would have to forego the money for an additional 12 months. Surely most of them will want to receive the money as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My new clause certainly provides flexibility, but in practice a trading subsidiary of a charity, once it has drawn up its accounts shortly after the year end and knows precisely what its profit was in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>479</span>
that period, will made the deed of covenant payment, which will equal the profit for the preceding trading period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and it may take a considerable time—up to another 12 months—before that tax computation is made on the audited accounts. Therefore, we are contemplating a considerable delay before the subsidiary company can be certain that it is donating the maximum amount to the parent company. I suggest that in practice many charities will want to make the earlier donations. They can do so by the mechanism that I suggested: they can slightly overestimate the profit and then, if necessary, adjust downwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made a valid point: I concede that if they get the estimate wrong it is not possible for them to donate above the sum specified in the deed of covenant. My hon. Friend's new clause would allow charities to top up the profitable element by way of donation afterwards, in addition to the early payment arrangements. That rather modest advance must be set against the fact that the new clause specifies a new category and would create a new complication in tax law, whereas we should try to apply tax law right across the company spectrum. Neither does this special arrangement fit well with self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-assessment has already been criticised for not delivering some of the deregulatory benefits that we claim. We must be vigilant and try to keep self-assessment as simple as possible. One of the simplifications is that companies, trading bodies and individuals will be able to deal with all their income, expenditure, reliefs, exemptions and profit in one year. My hon. Friend's proposal is that subsidiaries of charities should be able to carry back from a future year into the earlier year of account. That affects the pristine simplicity of self-assessment as described by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and it would be an unwelcome regulatory development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the National Council for Voluntary Organisation wants, and it represents 600 charitable bodies in the United Kingdom. So there is strong feeling in favour of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that charities would want to use the facility and, from their representations to me, I know that they do. They could still pay the deed of covenant in the earlier period if they so wished. The proposal would give the charities some flexibility and make their lives simpler. Instead of going back to the Inland Revenue and making complicated arrangements for the repayment of tax that has been over-deducted, charities could make a deed of covenant when they were certain about the amount of profit available. That is a simplification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already conceded that my hon. Friend's suggestion is not a bad one. It is not absurd; nor would it be disastrous for the tax structure or for enforcement. However, for a modest increase in convenience for some charities, we are being invited to complicate the tax statutes further. Self-assessment will allow simplification and deregulation: in that context, the proposal represents an unwelcome advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>480</span>
Although I understand that some charities believe that they would benefit, the Committee must be the guardian of simplicity and deregulation wherever possible. The statutes are already complicated enough, so for that reason I suggest that on balance my hon. Friend's new clause is unwelcome, although I understand the motives that underlie it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A year or two ago, an arrangement was introduced to help United Kingdom plcs that have substantial income from overseas and which had a problem with their advance corporation tax. It has worked well, but the Bill gives rise to a problem that has been drawn to my attention by the Association of British Insurers. I can do no better than to read out to the Committee the association's note, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Paragraph 5, Schedule 25 of the Finance Bill applies to life insurance companies taxed by reference to their trading profits rather than those subject to tax under the I-E basis".</p></blockquote>
That means income minus expenditure. The note on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It requires such companies to include foreign income dividends in their taxable receipts. However, it makes no allowance for the fact that such dividends have been paid out of taxed profits. If the paragraph is adopted it will mean that foreign income dividends received in excess of liabilities (and thus included in the net trading profit) will be liable to corporation tax of 33 per cent. Such foreign income dividends will be taxed twice. In practice, the reinsurer is likely to revise its choice of investments to avoid double taxation. This distortion of investment decisions because of tax effect is wrong in principle and runs counter to Government objectives of making it easier and simpler for United Kingdom companies to issue foreign income dividends.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The solution is the amendment of paragraph 5 to restrict FIDs brought into account to those that will be used to meet liabilities."</p></blockquote>
That is what the amendment would achieve and I hope that my hon Friend the Financial Secretary will look favourably upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

With regard to the inclusion of foreign income dividends in the I minus E calculation of profitability, it has always been the Government's intention that those forms of dividend income should be included in the calculations to which my hon. Friend referred. The effect of that policy was lost in a previous amendment to the law and we want merely to re-establish the position beyond doubt.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will understand that it would be somewhat unfair in calculating the tax position of life insurance companies if, given the generous treatment of their liabilities, we did not include the foreign income dividend. I looked at a worked example of a company, which had a substantial amount of profitability offset by an equally substantial amount of liability, and there was a relatively small profit. If we removed the foreign income dividend from the calculation, we could expunge the entire company's liability to taxation. My hon. Friend, who is a fair man, will understand that that was not our intention with regard to taxing companies. Without going into more detail—unless pressed—I hope that my hon. Friend will understand why I cannot go further, especially in terms of the history of the matter, or accept his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) asked a specific question about how a company that claims to be an international headquarters company can find out where its shareholders are resident when it has a large number of overseas shareholders. It is for the company to demonstrate that the condition in paragraph 4 is met. We recognise that that might be difficult for foreign quoted companies, with many shareholders, but there are special rules so that they do not need to meet the 80 per cent. condition. That is an important amendment to allow foreign income dividends to be paid by international headquarters companies located in the United Kingdom. We want to enable more of them to take advantage of that by virtue of the different chain of ownership identified by the clause. If that answer is not entirely satisfactory to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, I shall gladly write to him in more detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very technical matter. I understand that life companies can be taxed either under schedule D case 1 or on what is known as an I minus E basis, which is income minus expenditure. My hon. Friend referred to I minus E, but paragraph 5 of schedule 25 deals not with I minus E but with schedule D case 1 and refers only to life assurance companies. the ABI says that there is double taxation. I am not sure that we shall get very far with this, but I did not hear my hon. Friend mention that point. Perhaps he and I could discuss it in another forum, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I became interested in foreign income dividends, FIDs, when they were introduced in the Finance Bill two years ago. I have looked at the matter, although some of it is rather

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>483</span>
obscure, which is why I have some questions. Why add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"resident in the United Kingdom"</p></blockquote>
when most people assumed that only companies resident in the United Kingdom could pay foreign income dividends anyway? Perhaps there is a simple explanation. A more serious problem arises in paragraph 3(2), referring to amendment (ea) to section 246P(2) of the Taxes Act 1988. Many people who have made representations have commented on that. The Faculty of Taxes has said that it is "almost incomprehensible"; the Institute of Chartered Accountants says that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"tortuous to the point of being incomprehensible";</p></blockquote>
and the Law Society was slightly kinder and said that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"extremely complex and confusingly worded".</p></blockquote>
Will the Financial Secretary explain that section? I think that it has something to do with foreign profits that have borne foreign tax at a rate lower than the United Kingdom rate. I understand that that means that all the companies cannot recover all the ACT that they would like to recover. So what does the change mean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably there will be circumstances in which companies cannot recover all their ACT if the foreign corporation tax rate is lower than this country's corporation tax rate. Will the Financial Secretary explain that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's comments on three matters relating to foreign income dividends. Again, representations from both the Faculty of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants suggest that it is not necessary for ACT to be paid, then recovered. I would be interested to hear the Government's views on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be interested also to know how such measures are working. New measures are often introduced—two years ago, foreign income dividends and, last year, venture capital trusts were introduced—but we are not told how they are progressing. There was concern that FIDs would not be attractive, so it would be interesting to know how many companies have issued them and whether they proved attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the scheme was introduced, we were told that the Treasury would receive a bonus of £30 million in 1994–95; that it would be neutral in 1995–96; and that it would cost the Treasury £100 million in 1996–97, and £200 million subsequently. Have those figures been revised in the light of the take-up, or non-take-up of FIDs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer some of the specific questions that the hon. Gentleman asked. His first question, on paragraph 1, related to the payment of FIDs by non-resident companies. It was never the intention that non-resident companies would pay foreign income dividends. They do not have to account for advanced corporation tax. If they could treat their dividends as FIDs, it could give scope for avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To our knowledge, no non-resident company has argued that it can pay a FID. If such a company were to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>484</span>
do so, we would argue that it is not possible under current rules. The amendment in paragraph 1 of the schedule makes it clear that there is no question of any non-resident company paying a FID.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about complexity. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, this is a complex matter, so there must be detailed rules under which the foreign source profits and surplus ACT can be identified. There must also be rules under which the amount of repayable ACT can be identified. Changes to how those rules operate in a particular set of circumstances inevitably mean detailed changes in the legislation. We shall, however, consider that complexity in the long-term exercise on which we are about to embark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why companies must pay ACT on FIDs when ACT is inevitably repaid. If ACT were not payable on FIDs there would, at least, be a substantial cash flow cost to the Exchequer. I know that the Opposition are concerned about such matters and that they will understand our attitude towards them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is assumed that all ACT is repayable and that the amount of any repayment is often unknown until later, allowing any company to pay a FID without accounting for ACT would raise difficult compliance and collection problems for the Inland Revenue. An exception is made for international headquarters companies, because the Government want to assist such companies to locate in the United Kingdom. The cost of such an incentive is relatively small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the measure is working well. One of the reasons why the scheme was introduced was the build up of ACT. There has been a reduction in that. To date, about 800 companies have paid FIDs. In the third quarter of 1995, which is the latest period for which we have information, there were 72 repayments, representing a total of £970 million—an ACT of £240 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many companies have made extensive and repeated use of their ability to pay a FID. British American Tobacco, RTZ and BTR, for example, have paid more than £800 million in FIDs since the scheme began. The scheme was widely welcomed when it was introduced and is being successfully used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is a potential loss of tax revenue to the Exchequer if not everyone who receives overseas income declares it. Having regard to the new regime to which we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>

Nevertheless, I hope that our debate will be constructive. The amendment is, indeed, proposed in a constructive spirit. In clause 150, the Government introduce their proposals to reform the rules governing investment trusts, with the intention of attracting additional institutional investment into the private rented sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), the Opposition spokesman on housing, has welcomed it in principle. In a later group of amendments, we shall make suggestions on how the proposal might be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 163 would allow investment trusts to proceed as the Government propose, with the proviso that the Government should report the effect of the clause on investment in housing and on the supply of rented housing within two years. I stress at the outset that the Opposition believe that a thriving private rented sector is desirable. It is important that the sector is supplied by responsible landlords who are prepared to invest in rented housing over the long term. I hope that housing investment trusts can be a vehicle for that. It is important also that the interests of investors and tenants are fairly and properly balanced and that investor choice between the private rented sector and other business sectors such as manufacturing, high-tech and research are not distorted by the tax and regulatory regime. We would oppose the creation of a short-term low-risk haven for footloose capital. We know how schemes such as the business expansion scheme were abused, at considerable cost to the Government, through loopholes that the Government eventually recognised should be closed. We want no repeat of that, and I accept that the intention in reforming investment trusts is to avoid it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Government's stated intention of attracting funds into the housing sector. Investment trusts can be a useful vehicle for achieving it. However, several questions need to be asked about how the Government propose to set up those investment trusts. Will the proposals succeed in attracting investors who will invest in that sector over the long term? Will the proposals balance the interests of investors and tenants fairly, or is there an in-built bias in favour of shorthold assured tenancies rather than full assured tenancies? We also want to know whether the proposals will distort investment decisions, and we are anxious to avoid the danger of repeating what happened under the business expansion scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must learn from past experience; they must also be prepared to learn from experience as the housing investment trusts are set up and as they proceed. No one disputes the acute need for decent housing of all types. Indeed, in his forward to the White Paper on housing, the Secretary of State for the Environment said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To take a single statistic—the forecast of social trends suggests that the number of households in England will increase by 1.7 million over the next decade. This has real implications for how we use resources—and for how we support people in their efforts to maintain stable families and homes."</p></blockquote>
That is a recognition of the fact that about 170,000 new households will be created each year. But the White Paper points out that the private rented sector has supplied only about 50,000 lets per year since the Government removed rent controls in the Housing Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>488</span>
So there are grounds for believing that the Government recognise that the deregulated private sector is in its present form unlikely to satisfy demand. The question is how far housing investment trusts will help to fill that gap. I am not aware of any Government estimates of the generation of suitable rented property through housing investment trusts. If research has been done, it would be interesting to know on what sort of projections the Government are working. I am not aware of any evidence produced by the Government that housing investment trusts as proposed will contribute on the scale that is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That inevitably means that housing trusts will be something of an experiment. There is nothing wrong with experimentation carried out sensibly and constructively, and we have tabled some amendments that we think would improve the experiment. But as the trusts are of an experimental nature, it would be as well to build in from the start a proper and comprehensive procedure for reviewing progress. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, we believe in a thriving private rented sector, in combination, of course, with social housing provision, owner-occupation, shared ownership and co-operative housing—the plurality of housing supply that is needed to meet the scale of demand. We believe that housing investment trusts have a useful role. But as the trusts proceed, a number of questions could usefully be addressed. Although we have not included in the amendment the exact criteria for the report that we propose, a number of obvious questions commend themselves. It will be necessary in due course to review whether the proposals have helped or hindered the provision of private rented accommodation; whether they have had collateral effects, such a fall in more wealth-creating investment—I referred earlier to the footloose search for a low-risk investment opportunity—and, importantly, whether the proposals have produced a good deal for tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When embarking on a policy such as this, it is simply common sense to ask how its success or failure will be assessed. The Government must assess whether their intervention in the market has attracted risk capital from relatively risky, wealth-creating businesses to relatively low-risk, property-backed investment—as has happened in the past. If that proved to be the case they would either have to amend the scheme or, more probably, put more emphasis on some other way of increasing the provision of private rented accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the risk to the taxpayer that might arise from the proposal about housing investment trusts is not like that posed by the business expansion schemes. No public subsidy is proposed for the housing investment trusts—or if it is, it is indirect, resulting from the non-liability to capital gains tax of capital gains realised within a trust and from the lower 24 per cent. corporation tax charge on the rental income from a trust's properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Countervailing arguments can be made. It would be interesting to speculate on the effect on the capital gains tax take if people were encouraged to liquidate assets in order to sell the properties into the trust. There might be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>489</span>
some theoretical shortfall in capital gains in the medium and long term, but there might also be some advantages in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are interesting and important questions which must be assessed as matters progress to ascertain how far the vehicle succeeds in increasing the supply of quality private rented accommodation. A fair balance must be struck between the interests of tenants, landlords and investors. Later amendments will suggest how the design of the scheme can be improved. It must be thoroughly and sensibly evaluated. It would make sense for the report that we advocate to be produced a couple of years into the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to follow may hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) and to support his eminently sensible and straightforward suggestion. The amendment would provide for the monitoring of this exciting proposal in the Budget and for its review in two years' time. That is a practical way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend, I welcome housing investment trusts. They have had a short genesis, having been mentioned in the Government's housing White Paper entitled "Our Future Homes, Opportunity, Choice, Responsibility" only last June. The ideas were fleshed out in the Budget, but they need to be fleshed out a little more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the aim is to bring institutional investment into the housing market. We must find out how the market stands at the moment, and how it may develop in the future. That will have an effect on housing investment trusts, which in turn may also have an effect on the market. The notion of a review in two years' time is therefore right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over recent years there has been a growth in the rental sector. There may be a number of different reasons for that, and deregulation may be one of them, but the present state of the housing market means that people are unable to sell their homes when they want to move to another job, for example. All hon. Members will know people who are faced with that problem. That increases the number of properties available for rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members also know people who do not want to buy housing and take a mortgage because they are worried about the future. There is no feel-good factor at the moment, and the evidence is that a growing number of young people in particular are choosing not to buy but to rent instead. If the economy and the housing market pick up, we may see a change in the rental sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor in the housing market is the 80,000 BES properties. What will happen to them in the future? It is important to take stock. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East asked about statistics and whether research into this matter has been undertaken. I saw some figures produced by the Department of the Environment which were quite bullish towards the rental sector of the housing market. They suggest that 60,000 new properties could be built in the next three years with an investment of £3 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>490</span>
It is important to consider what housing investment trusts could achieve. I read a useful report produced by Coopers and Lybrand on behalf of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It was published earlier this year and said that housing investment trusts could attract £1 billion of investment for 20,000 homes in the next two or three years. Will the Financial Secretary focus on those significant figures and tell us whether that is also the Treasury's assessment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East said, a number of questions about housing investment trusts need to be asked. Housing investment trusts do not exist at the moment, so it will be extremely interesting to see how they develop over the next two years. I am expecting some imaginative projects. How will housing investment trusts develop? At some point they will want to be traded on the stock exchange. The Rowntree Foundation report confirmed my understanding that at the moment that may not be possible. The rules of the stock exchange will have to be changed to enable those trusts to be traded. Baby housing investment trusts will be formed, will develop, will re-invest and will eventually seek flotation on the stock market. A review in two years' time will enable us to examine that and focus on the response of the stock exchange to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to press the Financial Secretary on whether housing investment trusts will be new entities. My interpretation of the material available is that existing companies will not be able to convert. In order to make haste, there may be an argument for allowing existing housing companies with a track record and with some interest in the market to convert into new housing investment trusts. A review in a couple of years' time would allow us to consider that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issues may arise concerning the management of the stock that housing investment trusts acquire. They will have the capital, but they will require good management if they are to make profits and to run smoothly. I am not clear how that will be achieved, but it could be in a variety of ways. A housing investment trust could employ a managing agency. I can envisage a two-tier housing investment trust with the trust holding the capital and sub-letting the housing on a contractual basis to another company acting as a managing agency. Again, it would be useful to consider that in two years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to press the Minister on the role—as he sees it—of housing associations in conjunction with housing investment trusts. I know that housing associations are keen to look for partnerships within the social housing movement, but as I understand the Bill, that may not be possible. That matter also needs to be reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East mentioned the interesting issue of shorthold tenancies versus statutory shorthold tenancies. Perhaps we may develop it during the debate. There is an argument for greater flexibility and I would be interested to hear how the Financial Secretary responds to it. I hope that he will look carefully at our amendment and not rule it out straight away. I suspect he will say that a review in two years is a break point which will stop people investing in the market, but I do not see it like that. A test of examination in two years will be an impetus—a spur—for people to get it right. It will also be an opportunity, if

things are going wrong—and they clearly could go wrong—for us to re-evaluate the matter and to change direction as necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to wreck the initiative, which is exciting and new. We should all note that, as with all new initiatives, evaluation is important. We can then learn lessons and try to ensure that we build from a cornerstone the secure foundation for a good housing market. I hope that the Minister will view the amendment sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow my hon. Friends the Members for Oxford, East and for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping). The clause is important in that it is an attempt by the Government to get desperately needed investment into the housing sector. We support that attempt because that investment has never been more important than now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood mentioned the report of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on housing demand and need in England. Incidentally, it was written by Alan Holmans, who was the chief adviser to the Department of the Environment on housing forecasting before he retired and undertook the forecasting of housing demand and need on behalf of Coopers and Lybrand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must recognise, as Mr. Holmans' report does, one of the current problems, which the private sector along with other sectors in the housing market will try to address. The report says that although during
	<br><blockquote><p>"the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s the increase in the housing stock was substantially greater than the increase in the number of households plus concealed families, between 1981 and 1991 this was not so."</p></blockquote>
Thus, there has emerged a serious mismatch between the increase in households and concealed households that need housing, and the number of fit dwellings in the country to meet that need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on the Environment today published its report on housing need, and several features of it strengthen the arguments behind the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East. We are at one in wanting to introduce investment to the housing sector by whatever means. We should also be at one in ensuring that the Government promote incentives and finance in the most effective way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee debate focused on the question of which forecast was correct—Mr. Holmans's or the Government figure of 60,000 a year for the next three years, which my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood mentioned. The Government figures suggest that between 60,000 and 100,000 social lettings a year would be appropriate—that is a fairly wide band. The Committee concluded that it was important for the figure to be at the higher end of the bracket because all the evidence suggested that the Government's analysis erred in several cases towards underestimating housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of social lettings depends on the nature of the private rented sector and availability in it, which the clause deals with. The forecast combines three elements. The first is additional households of which there will be 4.4 million by 2016 according to Government figures. I have no quarrel with that. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>492</span>
second element is the Government forecast of 1.5 million for the number of households that will be owner-occupiers. They forecast that home ownership will increase to 70 per cent. of the total tenure in the housing market by 2006. That may be mistaken because the market and the home ownership pattern are increasingly characterised by the fact that many people are not confident enough in their employment prospects to engage in home ownership. Households that can afford home ownership are increasingly going into the private rented sector. The more that that happens, the fewer the houses in that sector that will be available for households that require "socially affordable housing"— a horrible phrase. The more the private sector is taken up by people who would otherwise have been home owners, the greater the number of dwellings in the socially rented sector. That is the main reason why the Select Committee believe that the Government's figures err at the lower end and need to be revised upwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, however, that if the effect of the clause were to put significant investment in the private sector so that both parts of the equation—dwellings for those who wanted to rent not buy their homes as well as those in dire need of housing for rent—were met, it would be one way of organising housing tenure. So long as there is no exploitation and the housing stock is in good condition, we are behind that. We need to keep the Government's proposals under close review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few shortcomings stood out when the Select Committee considered the private rented sector. They are familiar to those who have been Members of Parliament for a long time. The first is the insecurity of non-assured shorthold tenancies. I am worried about the clause because it encourages non-assured shorthold tenancies at the expense of assured tenancies, which offer householders more security and help to avoid disruption and distress that people face when they are removed from their tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, the clause will increase insecurity for people in the private rented sector. Unless the balance is shifted firmly in favour of assured tenancies, there will be a danger of people at the bottom of the housing ladder—those who can afford it least—being pushed into insecurity or plain exploited. That has happened in the past and we do not want it to happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second drawback that the Select Committee noted was the poor condition of property in the private rented sector. It is in such a bad condition that it requires considerable resources to be spent on it. The report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were concerned at the poor condition of some of the private rented sector stock and would urge the Government to examine closely ways of bringing such stock up to standards of repair comparable with those expected in the public sector."</p></blockquote>
For example, we visited a big estate in Southwark, across the river, where there are many private rented houses, and where people have lived for many years in extremely poor conditions. Their kitchens had no proper heating and many of the houses had inadequate heating. Although a major repair scheme was taking place that might attract a housing investment trust, there was very little guarantee of the expected standards of that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>493</span>
scheme. People were staying in their houses, suffering great stress while repairs were being carried out, but the work did not even include central heating. The idea that a major modernisation and repair scheme in the public sector, whether in housing association or local authority housing, would be done to such a low standard, leaving a house with perhaps only one source of heat, would not be countenanced by any reputable housing authority in the country. Unless there are checks and balances, reviews and monitoring of the investment in the private sector, we are concerned that money will be wasted. The tenants involved had very little power or influence on the schemes that were proposed, planned and designed. I hope that the Minister will consider how to ensure that the proposals in the clause will keep standards high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third difficulty that the Select Committee identified in the private sector is the question of voids—the Government are fond of citing that one. Far from the traditional Conservative party's response of why cannot we reduce the void rate, the Select Committee found a stark contrast. Again I quote its report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We commend those local authorities which have reduced their void rate below the Government's target of 2 per cent.".</p></blockquote>
We encourage all local authorities to achieve that target. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We also welcome the low void rates being achieved by housing associations and we hope that similarly low levels will soon be achieved with the Government-owned stock. But the great majority of empty homes are privately owned and it is in relation to this sector that the Government need to bring forward new ideas and new incentives to keep voids to a minimum while respecting the freedom of choice of private home-owners."</p></blockquote>
Within that category, we would include private landlords in the private-rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be the most inexcusable waste of housing investment and resources were such resources to go into schemes and projects that leave large numbers of adequate dwellings empty. We have the figures for housing need, so any number of voids should concern us. Local authorities have brought their void rates down and housing associations are well on the way to meeting that excellent level, but the private sector is not. There are many empty dwellings in the private-rented sector. One of the reasons for that is the sluggishness in the housing market. People move and then cannot sell their houses, so they find shared accommodation—cheaprented accommodation—leaving their houses empty. The Government's economic policies are the root cause of poverty and insecurity, and are leading to the extra void rate in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know how the measure will have a significant impact on the void rate in the private rented sector. Does the Minister consider that, by making such an investment more easily available in the private rented sector, it will result in a significant difference? Clearly, there are ways in which the Government have only limited control over private finance in the housing sector. Examples of that are manifold, such as can be seen in Birmingham where companies were encouraged to set up trusts to buy large blocks of flats. However, no financial institutions are prepared to lend on that basis
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>494</span>
because of the condition of the blocks and the surrounding area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that investment under the measure may be caught up in urban areas, where other financial institutions are not willing to lend and where the practice of "red lining" becomes acute. I refer to residue estates where private landlords have taken the incentive and invested money to upgrade the dwellings. Those incentives were not followed up by financial institutions offering finance for people who might want to buy the houses in future, because such dwellings were red lined or black listed by the financial institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East suggests that the clause is fine in principle, but dicey in detail. If the Government have any sense, they will introduce into the clause flexibility to allow housing investment trusts to make more of partnership arrangements with housing associations and to have more variability with regard to the type of tenancies with which they must deal.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me do my best to reply to the points raised in a wide-ranging discussion on housing investment trusts. I hope that I will not be interrupted by the Division bell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, East and others welcomed the concept of housing investment trusts. I am glad that there is such accord on that initiative. I hope that I do the hon. Gentleman no injustice if I say that, when he moved the amendment, he put the weight of his remarks on the possibility of some form of report being presented after a time, so that an appraisal could be made of the success or otherwise of the policy. However, he glossed over another important point of detail in his amendment, which would effectively give a limited life—subject again, perhaps, to some kind of review—to the first period of the housing investment trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends must trust those who invest in housing investment trusts, those who run them and those who manage the housing. All
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>495</span>
those people must feel their way into a new market. If they are to achieve all the laudable objectives that hon. Members have described, they must have confidence that the private sector can undertake that work without a sword of Damocles hanging over their head—without a time limit being imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering investment vehicles that will take a long-term view. As I listened to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson), I jotted down some of the words that she used. She said that there should be "checks and balances" and "monitoring" of the investment. That shows a hint of suspicion and a desire to intervene and control important attributes of the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Financial Secretary not bringing a rather churlish negativism to our highly constructive amendment? The issue is not that we do not have confidence in the operation of the markets and the stimulus to private investors. The question mark over confidence hangs on the framework that the Government have put in place. Many investors might welcome a review of the scheme, which would ensure that, where it was not working well because of the Government's framework, it could be improved. That is the positive way to look at our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rather different formulation from the words that were originally used and the hint of suspicion that I detected in the remarks of some hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the attributes of the Treasury is that all tax policies are kept under regular review. Bearing in mind that housing investment trusts will be creatures of the private sector, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that one of the most crucial tests of their effectiveness will be what they tell the people who put money into them. The trusts will have to deal with people investing serious money, and they will want to be successful. We monitor all our policies carefully and, from time to time, as every Finance Bill attests, some of those policies need to be modified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has hit on the very point that we are trying to make. Any policy connected with housing must look after the people providing the finance, but we are talking about the people who will live in those homes. We want to ensure that the Bill will raise the standards of housing that people live in, not just help the financiers who invest in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point, and have no doubt that people investing in property through the mechanism of a housing investment trust will want a high-quality property portfolio. They will want high quality so that the opportunity to rent by whatever form of rental agreement is deemed appropriate for the portfolio is taken up. The whole idea is to attract into the marketplace new units of rented accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To address the central point of the amendment, what worries me is that the Opposition propose a relatively short time limit before a fairly severe review is carried out. That could put people off making a long-term commitment and contribute to creating uncertainty,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>496</span>
which would undermine objectives which I think the Committee agrees are wholly laudable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that part of the reason for the amendment is an innate suspicion of read-across from the BES. The Opposition want to satisfy themselves that some of the things that were not to their liking in that scheme are not involved in housing investment trusts. We should have confidence in the trusts, which will bring in new money. I therefore do not agree with the time limit proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Oxford, East and for Hillsborough postulated that the scheme might be biased in favour of shorthold tenancies, which we shall discuss under later amendments. It will be up to housing investment trusts to choose how to rent their properties to best effect in terms of their investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I should like to make a little progress. The hon. Lady entertained us to a tour de force on the subject of the Select Committee's report, and I must do her the justice of trying to reply to some of the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee touched on the question of the number of properties involved and the amount of money that may be invested, and mentioned the Coopers and Lybrand report for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The estimates showed that about 20,000 new units could be created during the next two or three years, which could attract up to £1 billion of new money. That is the exciting feature of housing investment trusts—they will tap new sources of money. I noted that the report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Housing investment trusts are an intelligent and well-timed policy innovation."</p></blockquote>
I think that both sides of the Committee agree with that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sherwood asked whether an existing investment trust could become a housing investment trust. The short answer is yes, but that would require a restructuring of its portfolio of investments, because, under the present arrangements, it would have virtually no property holdings. It would be for it to decide whether that was an appropriate use of its resources. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned an important point: the relation between a housing investment trust and a housing association. Housing management will be an important issue. From work that I undertook previously on sheltered accommodation for the elderly, I feel strongly about that issue. I helped to introduce a code of practice to deal with the management and sale of such property, and gained an insight into its importance. The hon. Gentleman skimmed past some of the difficulties that housing investment trusts might have in getting a stock exchange listing. One requirement will be to he associated with good-quality housing management—housing associations will be important in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Financial Secretary has picked up on the ambiguity and the way in which such things are skimmed over. The fact that such devices are new and adventurous and that we are skating over them on thin ice, shows that a review is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not go into detail. I do not say that insultingly because there will be further a opportunity to go into detail on this matter. I picked up on the point made by the Hon. Gentleman because it is important both for good quality housing management and the question with which housing investment trusts must deal when they deploy their new resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member for Hillsborough put too much weight in her comments when she tried to juxtapose an analysis of the number of housing units that are required for the rented sector with the role that the housing investment trust will play. They are but one of many elements dealing with the housing problem. On the matter of the deployment of their funds, there is an ability to expand the rented sector and take some pressure off people who might decide for various reasons that at their time of life they do not want to buy a property but to rent one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not discuss in detail the question of confidence. In earlier debates we demonstrated what we have done to improve confidence. The hon. Member for Hillsborough mentioned the important subject of void houses. I shall not trespass into a wider housing debate, but I confirm that in some circumstances housing investment trusts could buy such properties. Clearly, they can buy unlet or vacant possession properties, and that might be an important development which they have to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that prove that housing investment trusts would be more effective if there were greater flexibility? If some of the provisions in the clause did not constrain them, they could take the opportunity to buy void houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating not the clause, but the Opposition amendment. The amendment, if anything would be a constraint on giving housing investment trusts time to establish themselves and make a success of their activities. I shall invite my hon. Friends to resist amendment No. 163 on the grounds that we always monitor policies, that the housing investment trusts will be answerable to their shareholders and that, therefore, there will be much monitoring by shareholders. [Hon. Members: "Oh!" Those interjections lead me to believe that there is suspicion about the operation of the private sector in that matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary cannot have it both ways. He says that there will be continuous thorough monitoring which will be carefully evaluated and that to do things in the way we advocate properly, in a structured way—will somehow create uncertainty, whereas his more secretive process of continuous monitoring will not do that.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already had a good debate on housing investment programmes. It is pleasing that they should have cross-party support, because the private rented market needs to be resurrected—or at least boosted. As a veteran of the Committee that considered the Housing Bill in 1988, when my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury was Housing Minister, it is a welcome change to find the Opposition so supportive of the private rented sector. In 1988, the Opposition were far from supportive of the moves made in the Housing Act 1988 to improve the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to make minor changes to how housing investment trusts operate, which would make HITS more likely to achieve the purpose that we all desire. Amendment No. 158 would change the tax rate that HITs have to pay from the present small business rate of 24 per cent. down to the 20 per cent. rate that venture capital trusts currently pay. The major advantage is that it would put HITs on the same level as venture capital trusts and enable them to compete for funds with venture capital trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
Housing trusts will clearly be in the same market for capital as venture capital trusts. To have a different tax regime would seem unnecessarily to the disadvantage of HITs. It would also allow advance corporation tax relief on investments made by HITs in shares. I remind the Committee that HITs are allowed to invest not only in housing but in shares and fixed interest securities. It means that advance corporation tax relief which the HIT would receive as part of the dividend on the shares would wash straight through at the 20 per cent. tax rate. It is an important change, although a fairly minor one, enabling housing investment trusts to attract the required funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 161 and 162 would enable HITs to purchase properties currently occupied by assured tenants. At the moment, HITs are not allowed to do that, presumably because it was intended that they would buy properties with new tenants. Those properties would either be vacant or would have tenants with shorthold assured tenancies, so presumably tenancies would turn over at a reasonable rate. The property would then become vacant and new tenants would move in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems unduly restrictive. Many properties are currently subject to assured tenancies and others may be built and then let. It would be sensible to re-finance them using a housing investment trust. It the landlord wished to dispose of a property, it could be to the advantage of a tenant with an assured tenancy if his tenancy were taken over by a major landlord, such as a housing investment trust, which would manage the property better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the proviso to that is that the household should be able to stay in that dwelling. If there were a change of landlord, the tenant could be asked to move out because the housing investment trust wanted to invest in those properties and needed to get people out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is right. Housing investment trusts, being open to considerably more scrutiny than private landlords usually are, would be responsible landlords. They are unlikely to use their ability to get assured tenants out, because it is rather limited: it is not easy to get a tenant with an assured tenancy out of a property. I accept that it is not impossible, but it is quite difficult. There are fairly limited grounds on which the landlord can apply to the courts for eviction of an assured tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 156 and 157 go together and tackle an even more serious point—the ability of housing investment trusts to make an impact on the London housing market. At the moment the restriction on the value of properties is quite tight for London. I remind the Committee that as things stand the limit is £125,000 for a dwelling house in Greater London and £85,000 elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In outer London that is a reasonable limit. But in my inner-London constituency, where house prices are not atypical, the most recent figures from the Nationwide building society—which may be out of date, but nevertheless make the point—suggest that the average price of a terraced house is about £175,000. That is on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>500</span>
the low side: estate agents in Hammersmith and Fulham would tell you that the average price is closer to £200,000. That is the typical Fulham terraced house with three bedrooms and two living rooms: in other ages that would have been called an artisan's dwelling, so it is by no means a grand house. If one wanted to buy a grander house in Fulham one would have to pay two or three times that amount. That is not atypical in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of £125,000 will not enable housing investment trusts to purchase at typical property values in inner London. They will therefore be unable to make much of an impact on the inner-London property market, which would be desirable if they are to provide rented accommodation. The reality for the private rented sector is that the part of Britain in which it will be most likely to make a major impact is central London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nationwide building society in my constituency gives a figure of £97,000 for flats and maisonettes, which is substantially in excess of the £85,000. Hammersmith and Fulham is by no means untypical in that. My amendment would raise the limits to £210,000 for houses and £105,000 for flats—or other dwellings as in the schedule—which would allow HITs to buy properties at about the average price. It is a sensible proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 159 seeks to clarify an obscure aspect of the schedule which suggests that it is not possible for HITs to let properties on assured and assured shorthold tenancies. The amendment would clarify whether that is the intention. It is clearly desirable for an HIT not to be confined to shorthold tenancies and to enter into longer-term commitments with tenants to provide stability in the market. Amendment No. 164 would ensure that HITs have a turnover of tenants, which is highly undesirable. It would be better if HITs were encouraged to maintain stable, longer-term tenancies, rather than shorter ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 160 would enable personal equity plans to invest in HITs. It would ensure that a larger pool of investment funds could invest in HITs as an investment vehicle. The amendment would involve no cost to the Treasury and would make HITs more flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my hon. Friend will be sympathetic to the amendments. Perhaps he can take them away and consider them carefully to determine whether we could improve the operation of the housing market by adopting some if not all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly reflect carefully on my hon. Friend's comments, but I should give him my initial views on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 158 deals with the taxation regime for housing investment trusts. I should draw my hon. Friend's attention to two points. First, any reduction in the corporation tax rate is more than we give to other investment trusts. We should consider his point in the context that such trusts are existing vehicles. There is, however, no special corporation tax rate for venture capital trusts. The alignment that my hon. Friend sought is therefore not required.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
Amendments Nos. 161 and 162 would allow properties that are let under assured tenancies—whether shorthold or not—to become eligible properties. We see housing investment trusts bringing to the market new property which is not currently let. Following his line of inquiry could lead to people buying the type of property mentioned in the amendment and making substantial capital gains that would have an Exchequer cost. But that would not achieve the central objective of bringing new units of rented accommodation on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also tabled amendments Nos. 156 and 157. I appreciate that he speaks with the experience of an inner-London Member, but he was unable to deploy the full range of facts in inviting me to consider the issues further. I must tell him firmly that I have studied property data relating to a number of London boroughs and I am not persuaded, on the basis of what he said about his constituency, of a general need for changing the £125,000 limit for properties in London. I do not want to accept my hon. Friend's amendments. If he provides any further information or analysis I will be prepared to consider it. However, on the basis of my analysis of the property market, I am not presently convinced of any need to change the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked for clarification in respect of amendment No. 159 about proposed tenancy rules for eligible properties. When a housing investment trust acquires a property it must be unlet or let under assured shorthold tenancies. When the housing investment trust lets them, they must be let on an assured tenancy basis. Since an assured shorthold tenancy is a species of assured tenancy there is no need for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 106 dealt with the eligibility of a HIT in the context of a personal equity plan. I can tell my hon. Friend that an investment trust is eligible for inclusion in a personal equity plan if at least half its investments are in shares or securities that are eligible for PEPs. I hope that he will see that, given the element of flexibility, there is no need for him to press the amendment. I hope that I have answered my hon. Friend's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly ensure that more research is done on the housing figures and that my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that we have to be conscious of the time because we are dealing with an important issue on which there is both cross-party consensus and cross-party concern. Many of the points made by the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) were relevant, and he offered an intelligent appraisal of how housing investment trusts might proceed. We could have debated that at greater length and the same applies to these amendments. I shall speak more briefly than I had initially intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 164 would protect the interests of tenants by requiring a ceiling on the proportion of shorthold tenancies. We have suggested one in four, which may be arbitrary, but the main purpose is to ensure that enough assured tenancies are generated by housing investment trusts, otherwise, there will be the bias to which my hon. Friends referred earlier. If trusts cannot acquire assured tenancies within the terms of the scheme, there will be an illiquidity in investments, which will have the perverse effect of being a disincentive to using the trusts as a vehicle. I urge the Government to consider that. As it stands, the incentive will be there for the trusts to concentrate on the shorthold tenancies. That incentive will be imposed by regulation, rather than by the market. That is ironic, given that Conservative Members always advocate market-driven solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be right for the tenants—and it would help the progress of housing investment trusts in general—if our proposal of a ceiling on the number of shorthold tenancies were accepted. In addition, amendments Nos. 165 and 166 are liberalising measures within the terms of the scheme. Amendment No. 165 would increase the attraction of investment in housing via investment trusts. It would enhance liquidity in the market by encouraging a secondary market—a similar proposal to that made by the hon. Member for Fulham earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 166 would encourage partnerships between managers of private rented accommodation, housing associations and investors in private rented accommodation by changing the terms of housing investment trusts to beneficial ownership. That would introduce much more flexibility in the arrangements that could be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This constellation of amendments contains one that would encourage assured tenancies within the scheme. Without that amendment, there would be a disincentive against such tenancies. The amendment could be considered restrictive—although we believe it to be in the interests of tenants—but it is coupled with two liberalising amendments which would attract investment into the housing investment trust project and increase the supply of quality private rented accommodation. That is what we all want to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be equally brief in dealing with the amendments. The hon. Member for Oxford, East may not have taken on board an important perspective in the concept behind amendment No. 164.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
That is that, if it chose, a housing investment trust could invest in new build and create new units of accommodation. If it did that, it could determine the best way to let those properties. I sam anxious that the trusts should not be fettered and that they should be able to find the right formula and balance between assured shorthold tenancies and assured tenancies that suit the needs of the housing investment trusts. All hon. Members share a hope that these vehicles will succeed in bringing in new resources to the housing market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am correct in my interpretation of amendment No. 165 as being aimed at the interaction between properties that are currently owned by business expansion schemes and housing investment trusts. The Government do not want to restrict the source from which a housing investment trust could acquire properties that meet the constraints of the type of property that it is able to have. The objective of the housing investment trust is to sustain and develop rented accommodation. Amendment No. 165 does not do a lot to assist in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 166 deals with the nature of the eligible property. We believe that the amendment would allow a housing investment trust to take almost any stake, however slight, in a property. There is an element of short-termism in that, as, for example, a trust could lease a property for six months and then sublet it in six months. That is not what we had in mind as the ultimate direction for the housing investment trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that this is a matter worthy of further reflection. I shall consider carefully what the hon. Member for Oxford, East said, but I hope that he will withdraw his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will not withdraw the amendments because we think that, had the Government accepted them, they would have served the useful purpose of making the housing investment trust proposal more successful. The Financial Secretary misunderstood amendment No. 165. It is a liberalising measure that is qualified by the reference to the business expansion scheme. It is not restrictive and, because of the BES, I want to pursue our amendments to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My point is the same as the one that I raised last time, so I will not weary members of the Committee with it. The difficulty is that the Treasury and the insurance industry do not agree on whether there is a problem and, if there is, its nature and extent. That is no less complicated than the previous matter. Since then, I have come across an interesting observation by a judge in a tax case called Briggenshaw 	<i>v.</i> Crabb. It happened as long ago as 1948, when tax law was a lot simpler than it is now. He said to a taxpayer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Your appeal must be dismissed. I will pass you back your documents. If I might add a word to you, it is that I hope you will not trouble your head further with tax matters, because you seem to have spent a lot of time in going through these various Acts, and if you go on spending your time on Finance Acts, and the like, it will drive you silly."</p></blockquote>
