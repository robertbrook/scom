	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 351, in page 372, line 10, leave out "in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (6) below" and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) in relation to interest payable on an advance made on or after the day on which this Act is passed; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) where an advance made before the day on which this Act is passed is sold or assigned on or after that day, in relation to interest payable on or after the date of sale or assignment.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 350 in page 372, leave out lines 12 to 42.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 33 changes the way in which interest payments are dealt with and amends section 349 of the Taxes Act 1988, under which exemptions from the deduction of tax on interest payments can be made gross in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to cope with a potential difficulty in the schedule. Under the schedule, when interest payments are made on loans that have been transferred from a bank to a non-resident bank or other party that is not liable for corporation tax, such as an individual, the party that pays interest must do so under deduction of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is sufficient publicity to make taxpayers aware of the proposals, they may work. I am, however, concerned that they will cause taxpayers problems with loans that have already been assigned by businesses in the United Kingdom that have carried out banking business. United Kingdom banks have frequently assigned loans to other parties, such as individuals, while overseas banks with offices in London have frequently assigned their loans back to their overseas parent company. That is particularly true of Australian state banks in the United Kingdom whose branches here have been closed down and whose loans have returned to their Australian parent state banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue has assured taxpayers who have taken loans from such institutions that they can
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
continue to pay the interest gross without tax deductions. Many taxpayers are in that situation and many will be unaware of the proposals, which seek retrospectively to change the system under which they pay interest on loans that they have taken out and which have been assigned to bodies that are not longer subject to corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that interest is payable under deduction of tax only if a loan is assigned after the Bill has been given Royal Assent. There would, therefore, be no element of retrospection, and taxpayers who have happily been paying interest gross on loans that were assigned many years ago can continue to do so. The amendment would greatly help the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased on this occasion, to express considerable agreement with the points raised by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg). The measure constitutes a significant change, which affects an important financial market. As has been implied, it could have serious effects in the syndicated loans market and could reduce liquidity; if borrowers are adversely affected, that could reduce the market's opportunities. I do not question, as the hon. Gentleman did not, the principle of that change. The retrospectivity to which he referred is an important consideration and those affected need to know the full import of the change, which should be properly and adequately publicised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Economic Secretary tell the Committee what effects the Government estimate the change will have on the syndicated loans market, on the pattern of reassignment of loans and whether it has implications for the total tax take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West for raising the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall carefully outline the change. As my hon. Friend said, it is tied up with section 349 of the Taxes Act 1988 which allows yearly interest to be paid without deduction of tax when paid by a bank or payable on an advance from a bank. The wording of the section is causing problems; it means that relief is due only for interest payable in the United Kingdom. A Revenue statement of practice and extra statutory concessions have proved necessary to enable British businesses to pay interest gross on some foreign loans, because the effect of the measure depends not on the person to whom the interest is payable but on the one who made the original advance. It allows, sometimes inappropriately, gross payment where interest is paid to persons other than the original bank, which could include even concerns outside the scope of corporation tax. That is why we are revising the appropriate section to remove the requirement that interest be payable in the United Kingdom, but providing that gross payment of interest payable on an advance from a bank is dependent on the recipient being within the chartered corporation tax in respect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
of the interests. That removes the current extra statutory concessions and clarifies matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change does not affect banks carrying on business in Britain—their customers continue to pay gross interest—nor does it affect non-bank United Kingdom concerns that have taken over loans from banks. For some time, we have been consulting with the British Bankers Association on that and the various other questions that it raised, yet we are finding it difficult to identify anyone who is adversely affected by the proposed changes. We have seen no reason to continue to allow gross payments to overseas non-banks: such concerns have had a good run for their money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society raised some points about the schedule and it was perhaps one of those points that my hon. Friend expressed in his example. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It seems that it was not, but the principle is the same: where a company in Britain takes out a loan from a branch of an overseas bank and the bank then transfers that loan to another part of the overseas bank—for example, to Australia or back to head office in Germany. In future, interest would have to be paid net, although that does not provide such a problem as has been suggested. Where the United Kingdom has a double tax agreement with the country to which a loan was transferred, the payer in the United Kingdom can seek the Revenue's agreement to continue to make that payment gross. Our treaty network covers most major and minor countries, but does not extend to notorious tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and Panama.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Bankers Association does not consider that the amendment will pose any problems for syndicated loans markets and matters related to individuals—it has expressed no concerns whatever. Our proposed regime does not adversely affect individuals or companies that have taken out perfectly legitimate loans, but it catches those who have deliberately taken advantage of a loophole. Therefore, although I accept the concerns expessed by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and by the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), our investigations over a considerable period of time do not suggest that the adverse effects described by the hon. Gentlemen will result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured by the Economic Secretary's explanation, but can she answer my question about the effect on the tax take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the change does what we expect it to, it will start to catch some people who take deliberate advantage of the loophole. Therefore, the change will result in the loophole being plugged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has any figure been put on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot make an accurate estimate because, as I said, people are taking advantage of a loophole and it is difficult to assess what is going down that hole. We cannot say that there is a finite
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
sum of money, but we can recognise that people are taking advantage of the loophole and try to restrict it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is primarily concerned with individual taxpayers who have previously been given assurances by the Inland Revenue that they can continue to pay their interest gross. Many individual taxpayers might not even know that their loan has been assigned and will continue to pay their interest gross in all innocence, but therefore fall foul of the provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend for not answering that point earlier. Following our consultations with the BBA and with the banks, if people fall into the situation described they are likely to have a break clause so will not find themselves at a disadvantage, as my hon. Friend worries. The alternative is that they would have the opportunity to assign the loan back into the United Kingdom, but our difficulty is in finding anyone who comes within that scenario.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that innocent taxpayers who have taken out loans but do not know about the situation will certainly not be making representations at present. Can my hon. Friend say a little more about what she means by a break clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct that individuals would not necessarily know that their loans had been assigned, but the banks would know that they had assigned those loans. That is the point that I am trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman moved the amendment so he has a perfect right to sum up when he has heard the Minister. That is his prerogative. He has no need to keep intervening, because he has a perfect right to speak again on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I did not move the amendment: I am speaking to the amendment. I hope that we can deal with these points during the Economic Secretary's speech so that I do not need to make a further speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As for the break clause, most loan agreements contain provisions to deal with changes in tax treatment. We expect those to be acted on where necessary. If a bank made an advance without provision to deal with changes in tax treatment and assigned the loan to an overseas concern without informing the borrower, the agreement between the bank and the overseas concern should cater for the effects of the tax changes. That has been the substance of our discussions with the BBA. I hope that I have covered every detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am informed by the Clerk that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West did
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
move the amendment. He can now withdraw it if he so wishes, but he is entitled to speak to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a United Kingdom branch of an overseas bank is closed and the loan has been assigned to its overseas parent, it is unlikely that the overseas parent will be aware of the change in the legislation and will contact United Kingdom borrowers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have agreements with most countries, with the exception of tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, so if the branch in the United Kingdom were closed and loans were assigned to the parent company, the individual should approach the Inland Revenue to discuss the difficulties that may arise so that they can be resolved under the arrangements with the countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the aim of my hon. Friend's amendment is to ensure that innocent people are protected, but I urge him not to press it as it is likely to give rise to a loophole that none of us want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has sat down, but if the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) wishes to speak, he may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. Hill. I listened most carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and to the Economic Secretary's reply. My hon. Friend has highlighted a real problem, which will only become apparent when individual taxpayers, who are unaware of the requirement to pay tax on the interest that they have remitted overseas, fill in their tax returns and the Inland Revenue attacks them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood the Economic Secretary to say that the Inland Revenue would issue internal guidance to inspectors to treat ignorance of the law on the part of individual taxpayers who remit the interest as an adequate defence so as to allow tolerance and fair treatment of those people's tax affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will reply briefly. I repeat what I have already said. There are arrangements to cover those difficult cases. We have double tax agreements with many countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for giving way. The problem that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham are referring to is the taxpayers' ignorance of the tax change. If they are ignorant of the tax change, they will also be ignorant of the detailed provisions of double tax treaties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but the bank is not ignorant. Banks are well aware of the change. Our discussions have been with the banks. They will know that they have assigned their loans. We want to ensure that if an individual discovers that his loan has been assigned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Minister, I am being requested by 	<i>Hansard</i> to ask you to speak into the microphone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The banks know that they have assigned a loan, so people with an assigned loan of which they are unaware can approach the Inland Revenue and make use of the double tax agreements that exist between Britain and most major and minor countries. Therefore, I can tell my hon. Friends that we have catered for the situation that they have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 186 and schedule 35 together have the effect of enacting 11 extra statutory concessions. A further five such concessions will be enacted by other provisions in the Bill. That information was given to me in a written answer on 17 January by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very welcome that the number of extant extra statutory concessions should be minimised. At present there are 207 published extra statutory concessions, and 191 will still be outstanding when the Bill as a whole is enacted. The Public Accounts Committee has called consistently for extra statutory concessions to be enacted in Finance Bills. Substantial progress has been made this year. I hope that further progress will be made in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, this morning seems to be one of cross-party consensus. I am pleased to agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), although I understand that there are 210 extra statutory concessions in the standard tax textbooks this year. I was simply going to ask the Minister why the Government have chosen the 11 that will be affected, and not the other 199.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and to the hon. Member for Oxford, East for encouraging the Government's work in trying, wherever possible, to give full statutory enactment to extra statutory concessions. I have considered carefuly how that process might be speeded up. I know that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), as well as the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
Member for Oxford, East and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, takes a particular interest in matters relating to the simplification of tax. The process of simplification that we have begun gives the Government a good opportunity to tackle the problem of extra statutory concessions, where it is necessary to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked why the 11 concessions were chosen. We thought that those concessions, out of the number of extra statutory concessions that exist, could be taken care of this year without overburdening the Finance Bill. That was a difficult balance to strike, given the comments expressed earlier in our proceedings about the length and complexity of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the proposals in regard to extra statutory concessions gave us the opportunity to allow private sector draftsman to exercise their skills in drawing up legislation. In due course, we will evaluate the success of that trial, both in relation to extra statutory concessions and in a more general context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can give comfort to both hon. Members. I intend to ask the Inland Revenue, as part of the simplifcation exercise, to see what further and quicker progress can be made.

	<div class='title'>MODIFICATION OF THE AGRICULTURE ACT 1993</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 340, in page 146, line 4, leave out "and (3)" and insert "to (3A)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may discuss Government amendments 341 to 343.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments reflect the fact that when milk marketing arrangements were changed, the Dairy Crest organisation was transferred, in terms of operation, to a residuary body. The Agriculture Act 1993 contained measures to ensure that the proposed form of disposal of the company by a public flotation would, up to the so-called vesting day of such procedures, be achieved with tax neutrality. Since vesting day has passed and the company has not been floated, there is a need to extend that tax neutrality in the substantive clause to which the amendments relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with a further variation on the theme, since they refer to another way in which Dairy Crest could be disposed of. Subsection (3A)
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
outlines the proposed formulation that is under consideration by the residuary body, that 30 per cent. of the company could be disposed of to an outside interest, leaving 70 per cent. in the hands of dairy producers. If such a formulation were to be followed, in the interests of dairy producers we want to ensure that the tax neutrality that was conferred on the original arrangements is transferred to the additional formula. That is what the amendments would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his explanation of the matter. What representations, if any, have the Government had from the dairy industry on that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the Minister. I remember when he introduced this discussion almost three years ago during the consideration of the Agriculture Act 1993. Perhaps I may remind him that many of us said at the time that the issue would be difficult and that he should make haste slowly. The Government amendments reflect slowness in that operation, and I am pleased that they leave the way open. I am keen to protect the interests of milk producers, who feel that they have had a bad deal. I should therefore be interested to hear what representations the Minister, wearing a different hat from the one he wore when he last talked about the issue, has received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may give a short answer to the question in the narrowest sense of my responsibilities now as the Financial Secretary, since the Bill was published and clause 188, to which the amendments refer, was put into the public domain I personally have received no representations either for or against the proposal; nor have I received any since the amendments were tabled. It would, however, be wrong for me to say that no representations have been received, because I do not know about the totality of representations within the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the more general question of policy vis-à-vis the residuary body and its stewardship of Dairy Crest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To pick up on a point of the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping), the reasons for the delay and thus why the amendments have been delayed is to protect the interests of the former—I should say the current—owners of Dairy Crest. The former owners and managers were the Milk Marketing Board, which no longer exists. The residuary interest rests with the residuary body. The postponement to a more propitious time of the ultimate disposal of Dairy Crest means that dairy producers' interests are being well protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments give a further dimension to the opportunity to make proper disposal. The Agriculture Act 1993 makes a specific requirement of the residuary body to do the best job it can on behalf of those who own Dairy Crest—the dairy producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would the Minister describe as a more acceptable moment? He might have used a different word, I did not catch what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not predict exactly that time. However, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the first financial results following changes in marketing arrangements for Dairy Crest showed a drop in profitability and the projected value of the company. As the marketplace adjusted to the new marketing arrangements, prices adjusted. Supermarkets recently imposed a price increase—the first for two years—in response to the changes. So profitability and the value of companies will improve. They are considering the best moment to undertake their responsibilities with milk producers. The amendments would provide an additional dimension to carry out those responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is the first one in which we move into the arena of loan relationships. Now is the appropriate time for a debate about how that matter is being handled in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear from the outset—I suspect that it will take several days to debate properly—that Labour supports the concept behind the change. However, we condemn the half-baked, unprofessional and incompetent manner in which the Government have handled the issue, culminating in their 166 amendments to 25 clauses and including the complete replacement of one clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change to be undertaken is enormous and it will affect almost every business in Britain, so it is extremely important. The effect on businesses will vary—some will have to make significant changes, although the majority will not be greatly affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause changes an area of law that has become increasingly complex and full of anti-avoidance provisions. It is in need of reform, and it is important that we get it right. If not, we shall simply replace our current difficulties with something that is just as bad or worse. That is not the objective of the exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we saw, the Opposition had good reason to criticise the Government on the self-assessment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
measures, the introduction of which we compared to the Child Support Agency debacle. We are concerned that the provisions in the clause may fall into a not dissimilar category—they are a good and necessary idea that has been damaged by poor delivery and implementation. The price for that could be paid not only by members of the Government who will have to answer for the changes, but by the many businesses that will face poorly drafted, rushed-in legislation which will not stand the test of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that not only the Government, but the Opposition learn lessons from what has happened because the Opposition will shortly be the Government. We, too, must understand that certain difficulties have been involved in the proposals and that that they must not arise again. It is worth rehearsing what has happened. Changes to this aspect of tax law have been discussed for several years, and the proposals are the culmination of a process that began before 1993 and the FOREX changes that the Government introduced to tax policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards loan relationships, the Government produced their consultation document on 25 May. The consultation period extended to about 10 July, when the Inland Revenue set out its proposals in a press statement. It was, however, very short, and several organisations were concerned about whether they had put their points across. Like the Opposition, almost everyone supported the idea of a change and thought that the suggested approach was good. We were, however, concerned that it should be implemented properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman's history has omitted a rather important fact. When representations were made on the consultation document—plenty were, even though there may have been little time—the Treasury responded in a significant way. It said that individuals with less than £200,000 worth of gilts would be excluded completely from the new system; indeed, it has subsequently announced that individuals will be excluded altogether, regardless of the level of their holdings. Does not that show that the consultation was extremely worth while?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says: although the consultation period was short and inadequate in many ways, it was useful and I accept that the Treasury and Ministers listened to the representations. As the hon. Gentleman says, changes in respect of tax law relating to individuals were made and further changes were made after consultation, which is for the good. Despite the fact that the legislation has been introduced so speedily, it narrows the area of its effect and therefore limits its potential damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman said also highlights the benefits of a proper period of full consultation. When the question of the period from 10 July to 29 November was raised on Tuesday, the Economic Secretary told us that the Treasury had continued to
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
consult with organisations during that period. Again, I asked the various organisations what had happened during that period and they said that it was true that the Treasury had spoken to several people—but they described those consultations as very private and were not sure that the Treasury had really listened. Organisations were not properly invited to submit their views of how the matter would proceed, but that is understandable because the important period of consultation was to occur after the publication of the draft legislation—which was 93 pages long—on 29 November. At that stage, the organisations had a far more exact idea of where the Government were going and what they were proposing than a press release could give and had the opportunity of making their input to ensure that the Bill properly reflects the needs of all businesses and has the benefit of the advice of the professional bodies interested in the issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That area of tax legislation is complex and Ministers and officials faithfully went through the consultation process that we on the Conservative Benches would expect. Has the hon. Gentleman any tangible evidence of significant interested parties or representative groups feeling aggrieved by the consultation process? If so, would he put it to the Committee for our consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to do exactly that in a moment. I shall set out the way in which the Government have proceeded and then outline the organisations' representations on the consultation process. Severe criticisms were made of the way in which that was undertaken and the hon. Gentleman is right that the Committee should be aware of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oddly, the Bill was published on 4 January, but the consultation period after the publication of the draft legislation on 29 November did not finish until 12 January. The Economic Secretary told us that consultations did not end even then, that representations were still being received and that the Treasury was still engaging in consultations. Brief as has been my opportunity to examine the Government admendments, I do not deny—indeed, I would assert quite strongly—that they are evidence that the Government have listened to representations made during the consultation process and that they will substantially improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
I accept that entirely. The Government have listened to such consultation as has been carried out and are to be congratulated on that. However, had the consultation been carried out in a better way, could what we are now accepting have been much better? I believe that it could have been and am supported in that view by several professional organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have every reason to know that a lengthy consultation process which continues throughout the summer in a very public manner can bring substantial benefits. They have held such consultations before. In the Finance Act 1993, the Government passed new rules in relation to FOREX;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
in 1994 they did the same thing in relation to swaps, but to a lesser extent. In 1993, the Government carried out a consultation process which was, by and large, very well conducted. A lengthy consultation process produced legislation which has required some changes but was broadly something in which the Government could have a degree of pride and which they could argue had stood the test of time. I suggest that it stood the test of time because the consultation was properly carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the current subject is not especially controversial in party political terms, is not a matter on which consultation need have enormous detrimental effects and is broadly revenue neutral in terms of the impact on the Treasury—I shall return to that issue later—I wonder why the Government did not carry out the consultation process in a better way. After all, we have now reached the stage where amendments have been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to John Whiting, the chairman of the tax committee of the Chartered Institute of Taxation who said that had there been a public consultation from July to November, we would not have this problem now. He said that there was no proper public consultation, but that it was "very private". Mr. Whiting thought that the amendments, which he had had a brief opportunity to read, were not sufficient to satisfy him that the legislation was being introduced in such a way that it would stand the test of time. He said that he would prefer a delay and that not having one left the Chartered Institute of Taxation feeling very uncomfortable. When it met with the Economic Secretary on Valentine's day, it proposed that matters be left until 1 July 1996 in order to ensure that there was a further consultation period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation is saying that, like us, it agrees with the thrust of the reform. It, like us, wants to get it right. It, like us, is concerned that matters are being rushed through and that there will be detrimental consequences as a result. The institute suggests several options that are open to the Government at this point and we agree. The Government could simply move the relevant clauses further down the order of consideration so that they could be considered in a week or two, but still come into force. Perhaps they could be considered after new clauses. That would be a matter for negotiation with the Chairman of the Committee, but it would allow some time, albeit short, for further consultation on the Government amendments. I know that the Institute of Chartered Accountants is not entirely happy with the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not asking for a delay until next year as I know that a lengthy delay might have other consequences, but a shorter delay might have the benefit of allowing some consultation. The Opposition would see the merit in that and would be sympathetic to any Government request for an appropriate delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman actually saying that neither the Chartered Institute of Taxation nor the Institute of Chartered Accountants—about which I make my usual declaration of interest—was consulted on those matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that at all. I understand that both bodies were consulted. The question is whether they consider the amendments under discusion of sufficient quality to be made into law. My argument is that their substantial concerns should be heeded. A delay, even of a week or two, might permit an extra degree of input from those organisations into the amendments that the Government have tabled. That might help to improve the quality of the final legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members know that the credibility of Parliament has been in question recently. It is important that we try to make the quality of the legislation that we pass as high as possible. A process of consultation is a small price to pay in taking that requirement seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whiting, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Taxation's tax committee, has suggested that the delay should extend beyond 6 April to 1 July. His proposal is that the consultation process should be longer, although no one suggests that it should go on until next year. He suggests that a separate Bill be brought forward. The proposals would thus come into effect later, but not significantly later. There would be none of the consequences that a long delay would cause, but there would be time for more consultation to improve the quality of the proposals. I am sure that the Government would agree that the consultation that has taken place already has improved the quality of the Bill.</div> <!-- member --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did Mr. John Whiting—I think that his name is pronounced like the name of the fish, and that he is neither witting or unwitting—explain how delaying the date of implementation by three months to 1 July would help? We can amend the Bill only in Committee or on Report. To comply with the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, the Bill must become law by 5 May at the latest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill must become law only if the House of Commons decides so. The proposition is that the existing measures would stay in place for a period of time—only a few months—so that proper consultation could be held. That would improve the quality of the legislation. Although some of the Bill's proposals would not be adopted until somewhat later than originally expected, all would come into force during this year. The date on which they would come into force would be a matter for debate: it could be on Budget day or before that. That should not cause any controversy. The issue is whether we provide extra time for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Chartered Accountants warned the Government in the second paragraph of its submission:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Institute welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Draft Legislation. However, the timetable for comments is too short and the Institute reserves the right to raise further points as and when they come to its attention."</p></blockquote>
It has exercised that right and has made further submissions, which have resulted in improvements to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have evidence of the way in which the matter has been rushed. We know how quickly the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
amendments were tabled: we have already discussed that. Like all hon. Members, I received the notes on clauses and noticed that, for instance, the tops of some pages were missing. The notes say that they relate to clauses 79 and 95, but they deal with schedule 8. That is further evidence that these matters were rushed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to the secretary of the technical committee at the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, who referred to deficiencies in the Bill and to it being "done so quickly" that it was causing problems. He does not give the Government's amendments his seal of approval because he is not in a position to do so. All those organisations support what the Government are trying to do—there is no party political argument on the thrust of the report—but they despair because of the way in which the provisions are being implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were given adequate warning of the views of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. In the first paragraph of its initial submission, it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Once again we face over 400 pages of new legislation. Once again we confront difficult drafting and intricate questions of construction. Once again we have to comment, within only four weeks of publication, on provisions of great complexity. We have been here before, and too often.… There is little doubt that the Loan Relationships legislation was improved by public consultation on the concepts as well as the modus operandi. However, we consider that the way in which the legislation has been produced, in haste and with only a last-minute attempt at consultation, is extremely regrettable. It makes an unfortunate contrast with the extended consultation process on the forex and financial instruments legislation. In this case, as elsewhere, we shall play our part in shaping a better final result, but it is likely that defects will remain that will have to be cured by amendment in further legislation. In the meanwhile, taxpayers will have to depend upon Revenue assistance and pronouncements in interpreting and applying new rules."</p></blockquote>
That is what we have encountered during this process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Accountants in Scotland was even more eloquent in its expression of despair. Its submission on clauses 72 to 97 and schedules 7 to 14 simply reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"delete all Clauses and Schedules relating to Loan Relationships."</p></blockquote>
That was its view of the way in which the matter was progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leading tax practitioners and professional bodies have identified major weaknesses that increase uncertainty, may increase the costs of capital for some investments, may discourage overseas trade by United Kingdom companies and may discourage investment in the United Kingdom by overseas companies. Different organisations have made different points. These problems will affect many British companies. Professional advisers say that almost every company in Britain, from the conglomerates to the corner shop, will be affected by this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary tell us how many companies will be affected and to what extent—especially with respect to the larger corporations? Will smaller businesses have to face extra burdens because of the way in which they have to handle the problem?
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
What analysis has the Treasury done? What width as well as depth of area—in respect of conglomerates or smaller businesses—will be affected by the implementation of the rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's attempt to expedite the consultation process was aimed at reducing uncertainty in the financial markets. I can understand the anxiety about that. We are not dealing with the FOREX situation, but the rules covering foreign exchange transactions and financial instruments were especially relevant to the financial markets. However, unlike the loan relationship rules, they are less relevant to the mass of United Kingdom businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FOREX rules were introduced in the Finance Act 1993 after four years of consultation and the financial instruments rules were introduced in the Finance Act 1994 after two years of consultation. Yet the Government have sought to introduce rules on loan relationships after just 7 months' consultation, despite their significance for almost all United Kingdom businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite short time scales, the practitioner community has been able to identify significant weaknesses in the proposals. It has made representations to the Inland Revenue, and the longer the proposals have been studied, the more weaknesses have become apparent. Because of the uncertainty created by the Government's proposals, practitioners may find great difficulty in providing opinions on loan financing without heavy qualification. That will inevitably undermine investment activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned changes in FOREX and financial instruments and the lengthy consultation procedures involved. In those cases, explanatory statements were issued by the Inland Revenue. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that because fundamental changes to corporate taxation are being proposed and assurances have been sought from the Revenue on many issues, it is important that we receive an explanatory statement on these provisions when they are enacted? I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will deal with that in her reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. That will be essential in view of the complexity of the proposals. I referred to a wet-towel job on Tuesday, but it was not quite like that. I have spent several days—arguably several weeks—trying to come to grips with the proposals but I am still uncertain whether I have come to grips with them. Indeed, I am sure that I have not. I certainly hope that the Economic Secretary has come to grips with them. We shall soon see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that all businesses, not just big accountancy firms, can deal with laws. The average high street accountant and the average tax lawyer—if there is such a thing—have to be able to deal with the provisions. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West was right to say that we must have a statement from the Inland Revenue on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
interpretation of the provisions. In this case, simply explaining the complexities will use up a great deal of our dwindling forests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting is lengthy and complex, with little apparent attempt to use simpler language. We shall come on to such drafting shortly in clause 75. To some extent, the amendments attempt to deal with issues such as unsatisfactory transitional provisions—which will introduce an unreasonable deferral of tax relief and certain interest—and the way in which the asymmetry between the treatment of lender and borrower in a number of situations is called into question. How successfully do the amendments achieve that? We shall have to examine that in the next few days. I accept that the Government have acknowledged many of those criticisms and are seeking to deal with them, but are they able to deal with them effectively and would they not benefit from more consultation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the issues that professional organisations have raised. From my own review of the recently tabled amendments in the limited time available it appears that many, but not all, of the significant problems that were identified in the initial reaction to the published draft have been addressed. As I said, the amendments make an improvement. However, it appears that not all the amendments are successful in dealing properly with the problems in question, and some issues have not been dealt with. No doubt the Government have reasons for that, but again, we will explore that during the course of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to say whether the amended legislation is sufficiently perfected for it to come into effect on 1 April. There is some substance in the argument that the loan relationship provisions should be taken out of the Bill and introduced in a subsequent, technical Bill, which could be enacted in the next six months. The delay of a few months would enable the great majority of the problems in the original Finance Bill to be properly addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not looking for a long delay; that would be almost as damaging as not having a delay at all. A delay until next year, which we suggested in relation to self-assessment, would not be practical. Companies are aware that the changes are coming up and of their general thrust, and they need time to plan and certainty about what they are planning on. A consultation period that is too long, once we have got to this stage, could produce confusion. We might even find that some companies plan on the basis of the detailed rules that we have already set out in the Bill and then make mistakes as a result of a lengthy period of consultation and our making substantial changes to the rules. They might then argue that the Government had misled them by putting out rules that they did not subsequently implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that all sorts of problems could arise from too lengthy a consultation period. There are, however, also problems with a lack of proper consultation. We will end up revisiting messy clauses for years to come, we will create further confusion and we will see court cases and greater expense for companies. Rules
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
should be made now on which companies can rely. That is the best way in whch to proceed, so let us get it right first time. It is a strong argument for some delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the beginning, there are lessons to be learned from this fiasco—that is not too strong a word. We need proper consultation before we implement the proposals. The Government did that when the two previous substantial changes were made and they could have done it this time. The Economic Secretary must explain to members of the Committee why such consultation was not undertaken this time. Parliament's reputation is bad enough; this sort of thing does not help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman say precisely how much delay he thinks there should be? When should the implementation date be, if it is not 1 April? On Tuesday, the hon. Member for Oxford, East said in the Labour press release that one possibility would be to make this
	<br><blockquote><p>"part of next year's Finance Bill."</p></blockquote>
Is the hon. Member for North Warwickshire now ruling that out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the options that is available to the Committee and the Government. We must consider the degree of complexity in the Bill. A delay of a week or two would allow a bit of consultation. The Chartered Institute of Taxation suggests a longer delay until 1 July. That would allow more consultation and is the option that I prefer, or the Government could say that, having set out the general thrust of the reforms, the details can be left so that they can be got right next year. Those are the options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to make the matter a question of what this or that party says ought to happen. We all want to go in the same direction. Problems have been encountered, and we should try to sort them out in a sensible way that is to Parliament's credit, not to its detriment. That would benefit us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses contain fundamental changes to the taxation of interest and gains from gilts and corporate debt generally. The proposals constitute the third stage of the fundamental change in the taxation of the financial markets. The first part of the trilogy was the 1993 introduction of the foreign exchange legislation, and the second part was the reform of financial instruments. Two principles underlie the three changes: that the difference between capital and revenue items should be blurred or eliminated, and that tax adjustments should be based on accounts entries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loan relationship changes arise out of a proposed review that has already been described. The aims are laudable and they are: to simplify the tax system by removing unnecessary distinctions between different ways of meeting the cost of borrowing and between loans from different types of lender; to allow the interest shown in the commercial account as a deduction for tax purposes; to remove the need to apportion the return on securities between capital and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
revenue; to rationalise the treatment of cross-border flows of interest to reflect international developments and to make it easier, as a consequence, for businesses to comply with their taxation responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current regime for gilts and bonds originated in the 19th century. As the financial markets have evolved, increasingly special rules have been added. As a result, our tax regime is in many ways top heavy, full of complexities, anomalies and traps for the unwary. There is a clear case for reform. We support it, and the broad thrust of the type of reform that is envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support in principle the encouragement for a gilt strips market. The Government hope, and we concur, that that will make gilts more attractive to the investor and will make the cost of Government borrowing more competitive and therefore cheaper for Government and taxpayer. The removal of the capital and income distinction seems sensible. That process of rationalisation and, I hope, simplification should lead to a good system of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standardisation of loan relationships for tax purposes, either to a calculation on an accruals basis or a mark-to-market basis, has much to recommend it. It would enable the big corporate players to continue to use mark to market as their criterion, and ordinary businesses to use the straightforward accruals income system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw attention to some representations that I have not had time to examine in detail, although I hope that the Economic Secretary has. Those representations relate to project finance in emerging markets. Some hon. Members received a letter from chartered accountants Ernst and Young. That company has a good reputation among members of the Committee and raised several problems that I want to flag up. It is probably better that we deal with them in detail when we come to clause 77, but it is worth mentioning them now because the move to the accrual income system will be a significant change. We are discussing the general principles of changes to loan relationships, and it would perhaps be right to flag up now Ernst and Young's comments on the issue to give the Economic Secretary the opportunity to deal with them if she can. Alternatively, we can discuss the details later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter, Ernst and Young say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Typically, for commercial reasons, the UK company will invest its capital in the form of a loan rather than equity. A highly capital intensive project may well not being to pay either interest on the loan or capital back to the UK investor's loan for several years—longer if there is a lender such as the European Bank of Reconstuction and Development whose loan ranks higher for repayment.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Companies not receiving interest on or capital repayments of their loans for some time could be extremely badly affected by the introduction of the new regime for the taxation of corporate debt, since they would be obliged to pay tax on the interest accruing for accounting purposes on the loan well before any such interest was received on their loan. Companies with only one project may even have problems funding UK tax payments.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>The tax cost of the Finance Bill proposals will adversely affect the economics of investing in such projects for UK companies, and will put them at a competitive disadvantage to competitors from other countries."</p></blockquote>
Further on, the letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"UK companies who invest in long term infrastructure and resources projects in developing countries are making a risky commitment—but one which ultimately benefits not just themselves, but both the economy of the developing country and the UK economy as a whole. Their involvement can help general relations between the UK and the country concerned, opening the way for other UK companies to export as the local economy becomes wealthier and more sophisticated as a result of the project."</p></blockquote>That is all entirely true. In view of the pressures of having to go to the Treasury to be briefed—I thank the Economic Secretary for that opportunity—I have not had a chance to consider the submission in detail, and nor have our advisers. If the Economic Secretary can deal with it now, all the better; if she cannot, we can come to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes are advertised as being revenue neutral, which I broadly accept. They are, however, revenue neutral for the Treasury, not the companies concerned. The process will create winners and losers. Sometimes that is not a bad thing, particularly if the losers are tax-avoiders with sophisticated schemes to avoid paying taxes and the winners are the smaller companies. What analysis have the Government made of the numbers in each category? Which companies are likely to win? How many companies are likely to lose? What type of business will they be in? As with any tax change—even one that is revenue neutral for the Treasury—it is important that members of the Committee are aware of who the winners and losers will be. Even good ideas can turn out not to be enormously successful in their implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, a good idea has been rushed. There should be more time for consultation, and we should have an opportunity to get the measure right. Cross-party consensus on the thrust of the legislation would enable us to get it right. A tax reform that we can all broadly say will be good could end up being bad tax law unless we deal with it properly. We must ensure that the consultation period is adequate and that the legislation put before Parliament will make good tax law which we do not have constantly to revisit but can look back at with some pride. That has been done before, and it could be done in these circumstances, if the Government have the will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee of my interests as declared in the register and especially draw attention to the fact that I am an adviser to the Chartered Institute of Taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have deliberately not spoken to the Chartered Institute of Taxation about the taxation of loan relationships during the past few days because, although I am its adviser and always endeavour to give it my best advice, I am not its spokesman in the Committee of the House. I did not want to compromise my ability to set out my own views with any misunderstanding on that score. However, before the debate is concluded and in the light of the remarks
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), I intend to speak to the Chartered Institute of Taxation on the telephone to verify some of the statements made this morning about its attitude to the issue. If there are any material corrections, I shall endeavour to find an opportunity to intervene to give the Committee the benefit of those corrections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The endeavour on which the Government have embarked through the clause and the amendments is absolutely right. The clause represents a major step towards replacing the system for taxation of loans and bonds—that is, the taxation of interest income deriving to lenders and the relief of interest charges faced by borrowers on the basis of accounting principles. In this case, accounting principles are either an accruals system or a mark-to-market system. The measure represents major progress in the tax system and has already been achieved in other tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inherently undesirable to increase the administrative costs of compliance and requisite companies to keep two quite separate books or sets of accounts—one based on accounting principles which their auditors will accept for purposes of establishing an accounting profit to be declared to their shareholders, and another for the purpose of accounting to the Revenue. I am well aware that to some extent it will always be necessary to keep two sets of books, but to the extent to which the divergence between the principles on which the two sets of books are based can be reduced, the measure is a positive move forwards. It will reduce administrative costs and increase the clarity and transparency of our tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that companies in Italy keep two sets of books. Companies in Britain do not have to keep two sets of books, but they have to take their accounting profit and make quite a long series of adjustments to arrive at the taxable profit. The changes will reduce the number of alterations that they have to make to their accounting profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend misunderstands me. The joke about Italy—I am not sure that it is fair—is that one set of books is for the tax authorities, a second is for the company owners and a third is for any potential purchaser. The books are all very different and one is concealed from the other. It is not my suggestion that it is the practice in Great Britain to conceal a set of books or that people keep such books, but it is undoubtedly true that taxable profit is a different concept from accounting profit. In some matters, it is difficult to see how that could be changed. Capital allowances are an obvious example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield knows the system better than I do, and it is important that as companies go through the year—rather than just when they are drawing up their tax returns—they are aware of what tax liabilities that they will incur because of the methods they use to conduct their operations. In a sense, they are monitoring the cash flow, which is important, and the accounting profit
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
and taxable profit of the business in parallel. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield agrees with that reformulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason why any discrepancy between accounting profit and taxable profit should be reduced to the minimum is to prevent perverse economic incentives finding their way into the system. We want companies to focus on profit maximisation. Considerable economic costs can be caused by a contradiction between tax rationality and profit rationality; people will be led into doing all sorts of things that do not add to the real value of their businesses—the measure of accounting profit—but which relieve them of tax because of the artificiality of the computations on which taxable profits are based. Those are not philosophical considerations—although I have presented them in slightly philosophical terms—but important economic ones. The Government have bravely addressed those considerations in their decision to take a new look at the taxation of loans and bonds. We should not let the matter pass without a member of the Committee paying sincere tribute to the Government for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->All members of the Committee would agree that the consultation process was not 100 per cent. ideal. Something went wrong with the consultation process last year; it seems to have been suspended, or almost suspended, between July and November. That relates to points that I have made in Committee in previous years. Without going into the details of the circumstances, last year I asked the previous Financial Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), about consultation. I did not receive a satisfactory answer, so I then asked him whether he would tell the Committee the guiding principles of consultation—the criteria that determine when consultation takes place and when it does not. I do not have the relevant 	<i>Hansard</i> in front of me, but the response was to the effect that consultation takes place when the Revenue feels that that is convenient. I was a little shocked—I think that other hon. Members might also have been—by that. I did not think it was a satisfactory response then and I do not now, in the light of what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should move to formalise the process of consultation to give general reassurance to corporate and individual taxpayers that when significant and strategic changes to the tax system are contemplated there will be a consultation process which will be announced in advance and which will be as public as possible; it should be organised in a predictable way and everyone should have confidence in it. Unlike the consultation process we have just witnessed, that process will not suddenly be interrupted, without warning, for no apparent reason and then go underground to emerge months later in a form that no one could have predicted when discussions were still under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue have to reconcile three difficult desiderata. First, to ensure that the consultation process does not cost the Revenue money; in other words, that it does not leak the Government's proposed policies in advance, thereby allowing taxpayers unreasonably to reorganise their affairs so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
as to unreasonably save tax—I concede that the definition of what is unreasonable is a long and difficult question. Secondly, because the advisers taking part in the consultation process are tax professionals—lawyers or accountants—they can have a conflict of interests: they know that matters are in a state of flux and are likely to evolve in a certain way yet also owe a duty to give their clients the best advice. They could feel inhibited about releasing to them information acquired through participation in the consultation process. I understand why the Revenue may feel the occasional need to be reticent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation process should be—a clear desideratum for the Committee—effective in resolving technical issues well in advance of this Committee's sitting or a Bill being published in early January. We know that that was not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lessons should be learnt about the consultation process. It will be to everyone's advantage if we can formalise the rules on consultation. Consultation started out as an informal ad hoc process. Over the past 10 years, the Revenue has developed consultation in a laudatory way. However, it should no longer be regarded as a concession to be made at will in an arbitrary way. It should be regarded as an integral part of tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What should a Minister do when the consultation process is unsatisfactory and tax professionals are in a state of panic about the text before them, which does not reflect consultations of six months ago? In such circumstances of uncertainty and difficulty, a cowardly or weak Minister would have said that decisions could not be taken and that the Revenue should be told to push things forward to next year. That is what the Labour party has done. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire is trying to ride off comments made by the hon. Member for Oxford, East, but it is on record that that is what Labour wants to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has taken the right decision—to involve herself intensely in the consultation process, to meet people, chair meetings and take decisions. She has made a decision that takes account of the difficulties and anomalies of the Revenue's original draft. She has tabled new amendments, and that takes courage because when the Labour party can think of nothing better to say, it can say that the Government have not done their homework. My hon. Friend would have anticipated such a reaction, but it did not deflect her from doing what was right and adopting a decisive line and creating a degree of clarity in complex provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some friendly advice, no more, for the hon. Gentleman. In working his way back into favour, he needs to get the balance right between obsequiousness and helpfulness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misjudges me. I am always considered and selective in what I say.
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
When Ministers deserve blame, I do not fear to say so, as the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged. Equally, when Ministers deserve praise, I do not fear to say so. There is not the slightest inconsistency in the attitudes that I have adopted with respect to wildly different matters. My comments have emerged from exactly the same approach to politics that I have consistently adopted since I became interested in public life many years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Are we getting back to clause 72? The hon. Gentleman is being gracious to everyone but he should return to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall not be blamed for having diverted the Committee's thoughts away from the fascinating subject of the taxation of loans and bonds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important point is that all the arguments have been aired, the professionals have had a chance to speak to the Minister, and we have before us amendments on which we can take a decision. If the Labour party have technical improvements to make to those amendments, they should propose them. What was notably absent from the speech of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire was a specific suggestion as to how the amended text could be further improved. I agree with him about asymmetry, but he did not say whether he thought that the Government's amendments dealt with that or how he would deal with it more effectively if they did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition do not have specific suggestions, I take it that the case is made and that we should proceed on the basis of the Government's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to praise the constructive contribution of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), who has shown considerable courage this week by standing up for what he believes in and for supporting the cause of more open government. That was the thrust of his remarks, which we listened to with considerable interest. I was delighted to see him get back into the flock of loyal Tory sheep. Indeed, I caught the Economic Secretary wiping a tear from her eye as the praise cascaded over her shoulders. It was heartening for us to see such a relationship—loan or otherwise—being restructured before our very eyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a fundamental point that the Economic Secretary has not answered. He cannot seriously expect Labour Members, having been presented with a raft of new amendments at a very late stage that tidy up and slightly alter the thrust of tax reform—which we agree goes in a good direction—to produce amendments to ensure that the Bill works as is intended. We cannot suddenly do that without the benefit of the considerable professional advice that Conservative Members have, partly through their work as advisers and consultants, and the technical advice that Treasury Ministers have from their experts in the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends on the Front Bench may have to take up more onerous responsibilities on the other side
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
of the Committee Floor sooner than they expect. With that in mind, they should consider a consultation process in which they do not merely ask professional organisations to come and see them—I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding that the consultative process has improved in recent years—but go much more public and not be frightened to put proposals in the form of a White Paper in front of the public before drafting the Bill. That is how it is done in other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding worked in France for some years. He will know that the Trésor does not present its tax proposals as a Bill to be amended: its proposals go through a lengthy consultation process in order to get them right. At the end of the day it is a political decision by Government—one accepts that, that is democracy and that is what Governments are there for—but the best mechanism for dealing with tax proposals is not nearly 90 pages of highly detailed amendments. It is to be regretted that there has not been sufficient co-operation and partnership, either on a cross-party basis or in consultation with the public on this part of the Bill. There are no major public revenue implications, so it is not a question of secrecy, as when some new tax proposal is announced and everybody repositions themselves quickly and rushes out to buy crates of whisky or to fill the car with petrol to avoid an imminent hike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield say that individuals who have £200,000 worth of gilts will not be affected by the measure. Indeed, no individuals will now be affected by it. I must say, I wish that there were individuals in my family who had £200,000 worth of gilts, but we all live in different worlds. The consultation process, however, will allow large companies with massive trade to position themselves more favourably with a view to the implications of the reforms for their annual profit and loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the demand for tax simplification—put forward by Conservative Members— under some of the new clauses, but it is especially pertinent to clause 72. The 90 pages of the Bill that we are debating are complicated and are not, in my judgment, best dealt with in Committee. Earlier this week the Economic Secretary apologised to my hon. Friend the shadow Chief Secretary. She was courteous and open about that. However, I hope that she will address the need for a new and more detailed and open form of consultation on those aspects of our tax law. Consultation with the professional bodies is not good enough, because they clearly have axes to grind and their own interests to defend. It needs to be wider and more public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is only my second year on the Finance Committee—which one of my Front-Bench colleagues said entitled me to be called a "senior member" of the Finance Committee—but I am very concerned that we have got tax legislation wrong. The system that may have served Governments of all colours for many decades is no longer appropriate. Next year—under, I expect and hope, a new Government—I want us to go into a much wider
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
process of consultation about these matters, so that they do not have to be settled by technical debate across the Floor of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but first I remind members of the Committee again of the interests that are declared in the register in my name. I want to stress, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, that I am in no sense speaking as an advocate for the position that has been taken on these matters by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which is one of the bodies that I advise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say, in a spirit of charity, that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire—with whom I have crossed swords before—was making heavy weather of his arguments earlier. He was making one procedural point, essentially, about the length and nature of the consultation on loan relationships. I thought, as I listened to him, that one could characterise Labour policy in that area as one of principled procrastination. I do not know whether he considers that to be an attribute or a disadvantage, but were he ever in Government, he would quickly learn that it is not a satisfactory way in which to conduct the evolutionary development of tax legislation. It is constantly necessary to revise, amend, improve and bring up to date the corpus of tax law. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, I commend my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary for the courageous and sensible way in which she is approaching these difficult matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some doubt about the Opposition's preference in their arguments. They seemed to be as fluffy as they accused the Government of being. Do they prefer 1 April, 1 July or next year's Finance Bill? As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield noted, there appears to be some division on the Opposition Front Bench. The hon. Member for Oxford, East seems to prefer next year, while the hon. Member for North Warwickshire seems to want 1 July. I hope that they get that sorted out and that they ensure appropriate consultation in their ranks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a cheap shot. There are various options for the Committee to choose from when it comes to how hon. Members wish to proceed. I expect the Government to say that they will rush ahead anyway, but I and my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East sought only to put the various options before the Committee so that we could agree on good legislation. Various proposals were offered as a basis for discussion. We did not try to draw such strong divisions between the parties that the two points of view would never meet. We sought to adopt an adult approach as opposed to the childishness about which my constituents too often complain when they see the behaviour on television of hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the cap of childishness fits, people will wear it. The hon. Gentleman's lengthy speech underrated the serious potential market implications of undue delay. Very large sums of money are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
involved in the types of loans under discussions. No responsible Government, who are of course advised by the Bank of England, could fail to take account of that, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will speak about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that one of the reasons for the Inland Revenue's alleged delay or lacuna between May and November of last year was that the Revenue was not ready to deploy the full proposals until November. If one is to have rational consultation on the basis of well-founded facts, it is sensible to delay that process until the Revenue is able to deploy its full proposals, otherwise the effect could be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand, and hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will confirm, that the British Bankers Association is now content with the results of the consultations. I should like to explore with the highly esteemed professionals in the Institute of Chartered Accountants, whom I advise, whether the hon. Member for North Warwickshire was correct and up to date in his representation of the institute's views on the matter. The hon. Gentleman may not be as up to date as he thinks. Much of his speech drew on the brief submitted in January by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and it is at least possible that the institute's opinion has been refined since then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that I spoke to Mr. Vidler a couple of days ago. If the institute's view has moved on, it is to the point that its members now believe that it is better that the Government have listened and tabled some amendments. The institute was not able to say whether the Government's amendments dealt with the problem, but I know that not all the points raised in the brief to which the hon. Gentleman referred have been tackled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the excellent Mr. Vidler well. If the hon. Gentleman has been in touch with him, he will know that the Chartered Institute of Accountants is not able to proceed as quickly in consultations with the Revenue as the hon. Gentleman might wish because of the extensive internal consultations that take place within the accountancy profession. However, the institute is highly professional. The merit of its approach is that any proposal gets thoroughly refined and takes account of all conceivable expert points of view.

The Committee should understand that the lawmaking process in all those cases is necessarily cumulative and bound to be approached in an intelligent, evolutionary manner. As I and my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) have suggested, we must take a radical approach to the tax structure as it affects different parts of the conomy and apply dramatic simplifying principles to personal and corporate taxation, although I do not suggest that we should do so in this year's Bill. Only when we do that, and grasp the nettle, will it be seriously possible to depart from the Revenue's well-worn and perfectly reputable evolutionary and cumulative approach, which I commend against the status quo. Each year,
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
the Revenue and Ministers seek to take account of intelligent representations that they receive on complex and important issues such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no practical alternative to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary's proposals. I look forward to hearing her remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everybody seems to agree that clause 72 should stand part of the Bill. You will have noted, Mr. Hill, that it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of corporation tax all profits and gains arising to a company from its loan relationships shall be chargeable to tax as income in accordance with this Chapter."</p></blockquote>
The reference to "this Chapter" has allowed us to have a wide debate about the introduction of the loan relationships legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposals. While they appear complex, it is worth remembering that we are getting rid of a much more complicated system, which has been around for a long time and has been added to from time to time. It had become so complicated that it had started to stifle innovation in financial markets. Some categories of interest were not allowed at all for tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system will be much simpler because it is based on the interest that companies charge or show as receivable in their accounts. We should try to reach a situation in which taxable profit is as near as possible to accounting profit, although we shall, of course, never achieve that perfectly. The production of accounts involves judgments and it is right that rigid rules exist in some cases. The most obvious example is capital allowances, although I belie e that they should follow commercial depreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to follow companies' accounts—that will help them with their tax computations. Hundreds of thousands of businesses will benefit from that; indeed, more than 1 million companies are registered at Companies House. Companies that borrow money will gain from the legislation because they will obtain tax relief on their borrowings when they charge it in their accounts, rather than when they pay it. There will be many winners, to reply to the hon. Member for North Warwickshire. That is why we should implement the proposals at the first opportunity—1 April—even though the consultation process has been less than satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, the changes are welcome, and the amendments to them are largely welcome, too. We turn, therefore, from the unsatisfactory nature of the consultation process—notwithstanding the fact that the Revenue has listened carefully and produced extremely welcome changes—to what the implementation date should be. I note that the hon. Gentleman has tabled no amendments to clause 97, which deals with the date. We have not been told whether it should be 1 July, 1 October or 1 April next year. All of those would, however, be extremely disruptive for business, which expects the changes to go ahead on 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to draw a distinction. There are the tax advisers, who have an indirect, rather than a direct,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
interest in the matter. They are clearly concerned about their clients' interests and that we have the best possible legislation. They do not, however, run the businesses. The people who do that—they are represented by the CBI and, in particular, by the British Bankers Association—have made it clear that they want to make progress. The British Bankers Association has told me that it appreciates having received responses to most of its major representations. We are talking about important detail which may impact significantly on companies, but it is only detail. We should make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end my remarks by thanking my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary for arranging the briefing with Inland Revenue officials. Those who took part in it found it extremely helpful. We were well served by the quality—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a moment, I am in the middle of a sentence. We were well served by the quality of officials in the Inland Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us more about the briefing that he was given? When was it given and who attended it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not able to give full details, but I know that the hon. Gentleman had the same briefing. I wanted only to thank my hon. Friend for arranging it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. It is indeed true, as the Economic Secretary mentioned the other day, that a briefing was arranged for the Opposition Front Bench. It was most helpful and I too am grateful to the officials who conducted it yesterday. Another instalment is on offer. However, that facility was offered only to the Opposition Front Bench. I raised the other day the possibility of briefings being made available to all Committee members, yet now we learn that some Conservative Back Benchers have had a briefing that was not available to others. Is it not fair, if briefing is available to Back-Bench Committee members, that it should be available to all of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have discovered that I may be at a greater disadvantage than I anticipated in making my short contribution to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a wide-ranging discussion this morning. I agree strongly with the comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for North Warwickshire and for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane). I also agree with the thrust of the views expressed by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding. It is clear that the consultation process has not been satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) spoke about the need for an evolutionary process. Without more fundamental reform of the tax system, he said, we have to live with
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
it. It seems that his process of evolution somehow takes place over a few weeks and then fossilises for the rest of the year, which is not good enough. The Labour Front Bench team has proposed issuing a Green Paper before a Budget statement in future years, which is a sensible way forward. We could take into consideration various detailed comments made in criticism of the 166 amendments on corporate debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many new regulations and extra-statutory concessions will be added as a result of the rushed process of consultation? A sweepstake is going round among Committee members and the finance professions about how many alterations will have to be made to next year's Finance Bill—around 100 alterations is the predicted average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation process has been unsatisfactory, which is one of the major problems that needs to be addressed. It should be extended in future, but for the present, if the Government wil not delay the Bill, we have to roll up our sleeves and get on with picking at all the new amendments. We must ask the Minister to justify them and also ask why some of the representations that have been made by the various professional bodies have not been taken on board as well. Mental tennis seems to have taken place: we thought that we understood what the legislation wanted to achieve, then a load of representations were made criticising it and then 166 amendments were tabled. We now have to work out which have been taken on board, which have not and which have been shelved. The problem threatens to ruin what I hope will be a pleasurable weekend watching the rugby because we shall have to prepare ourselves to consider all the clauses next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those brief preliminary comments to suggest the inadequacies with how the issue has been handled, I rest my case and look forward to catching your eye again later, Mr. Hill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a worthwhile debate and I am grateful to all those who have taken part in it. I shall try to answer as many points as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire supports the concept because the process before us has been moving steadily up the agenda not just for the representative bodies but for the far wider audience of industry which deals with complicated debts in a complicated market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start with the consultation process because that was the subject of many of the points raised in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The surprise in the debate was contained in the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. Will the Economic Secretary tell us about the briefing by civil servants of Conservative Back Benchers? When and where did that occur, who attended, how long did it last, what other parts of the Bill have Conservative Back Benchers been briefed on by civil servants, why did that happen and why
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
were such facilities offered only to Conservative Back Benchers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing with clause 72.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that an instruction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Obviously the issue of consultation was enormously important during the debate as was the complexity of the issue—we are examining the entire chapter about loan relationships so it might be helpful if the Economic Secretary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The whole trouble is that I have been too generous this morning and we have discussed many factors. We must get back to clause 72.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill. I shall answer as many questions as I can on clause 72 within your guidance. Perhaps I can deal with many of the points raised—including those put by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire—by discussing the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is widely known, the consultation started on 25 May last year, primarily to ensure that we had a tax system to cater for the gifts strips market, but its consequence was unexpected. It resulted in tremendous pressure for change to the taxation system for corporate debt. That is why we widened the consultation beyond enabling one part of a change in the gilts market to go ahead—we responded by ensuring that the wider changes that were strongly requested happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the first, second or third time that such changes have been requested. The pressure has existed for many years, but has now reached the top of the agenda. Therefore, where the consultation started and where it finished were two rather different places. The fact that a consultation period might be finite—from May to July—does not mean that consultation stops. The Treasury continued to receive many representations from a variety of audiences, not just the groups to which we refer continually, but from business and from people involved in financial affairs or in companies. Although a period of time was specified, that did not mean that we were not continuing to listen to and examine the many representations that were made. Treasury officials spoke at gatherings in June and July and carried on doing so as soon as Budget day was over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of questions about who said what to whom were raised this morning, especially in relation to the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Chartered Institute of Taxation. I have a note of some conversations that took place as a consequence of my undertaking last Tuesday that we would try to contact those organisations before their staff went home. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
responses that we obtained as a result of that contact did not correspond with what had been described in the Committee. So I think that it is a good idea that my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding is to visit the Chartered Institute of Taxation when the Committee adjourns for lunch, as a personal balance needs to be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since I spoke in the Committee a few minutes ago I have spoken to Mr. Whiting by telephone. He has authorised me to say that, in an ideal world, he would like to have more time and that he is not entirely happy with the way in which the consultation process worked out last year. However, the constitutional choice is between amending this year's Finance Bill and getting it right or waiting until next year. Mr. Whiting made it clear to me that he would certainly prefer to amend this year's Bill. He has a few points to raise—I do not know what they are—but he is broadly content with the amendments before the Committee which he believes reflect the consultations that he has had with my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and her officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a significant difference between being content and being uncomfortable, which was the word used to me in the telephone conversation that I had with the person to whom the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding has just spoken. There remains a need for clarification, but the hon. Gentleman has confirmed that the Chartered Institute of Taxation would have preferred to have a further period of consultation. I never suggested that that body wanted to delay matters until next year: as I told the Committee, the institute was seeking a delay until 1 July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Institute mentioned that to me, but it could not say what was supposed to happen with all the companies that are geared up for change on 1 April. That is the balance that is at stake. Changes should not be made for the sake of the Chartered Institute of Taxation or any other organisation; changes should be considered only for the sake of companies and the people who are involved in the many complex arrangements needed to finance the companies that benefit the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we are under tremendous pressure to make the changes in the loan relationships clauses. I have said that before and no doubt will say it again. Since we published the amendments we have heard from the Association of British Insurers, the British Bankers Associations, the building societies' offshore fund and the Confederation of British Industry—all very keen on getting the reforms this year. All those bodies and their members are geared up for implementation on 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall not pretend that the consultation was perfect. It was not. There were flaws in the process and we need to learn substantial lessons from that if we ever again propose such major changes in a Finance Bill. The hon. Member for Rotherham said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
that he would like to have everything published in advance. Again, that would happen only in an ideal world. In reality, some of the clauses are sensitive because they relate to anti-avoidance. If one announces what one is thinking of doing and that one is going to do it in six months time, one makes it possible for those who wish to avoid paying the proper tax to disappear down a hole and for us to wave goodbye to the revenue. If we say goodbye to too much revenue, we also say goodbye to many projects that we want to fund. Therefore, while wholesale consultation for as long as one would wish is a nice ideal, we do not live in a perfect world and we have to make compromises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am withering at the prospect of revenue disappearing unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, a Conservative member of the Committee attempted to polarise the issue by contrasting the measure having been rushed through with its being put off until next year. We have been arguing that, whereas the Government brought themselves several weeks' grace when they realised that the original Bill was unsatisfactory by scheduling the clauses at the end, there is to be no period of grace for reflection—not only by the Opposition, but by the interested bodies and the public—before the amendments come into effect. We suggested a period of deferral that would have enabled that reflection to occur sensibly. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said earlier that no one wants to interfere with the underlying business decisions and we recognise their importance. Does the Minister accept that the procedure has been fundamentally unsatisfactory because of the asymmetry between the amount of time that the Government have taken to get their act together and the lack of time that has been given to the various organisations involved to consider the impact of the changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which is why I say the consultation period was not perfect. However, the fundamental reason the clauses are being taken out of their place in the Bill is so that we can adopt the important points made by the various organisations and companies that responded to the consultation during all its stages—from May onwards. We would have been wrong not to listen to those points and not to have made the changes. We still have a deadline to work to because businesses want to raise funds in accordance with the loan relationship clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall ensure that the Revenue helps by giving guidance on the interpretation of the law. Its guidance to business staff will be published in full under the open government process—a point that members of the Committee have raised. If experience of the legislation suggests that we need to consider amending subsequent Finance Bills, we will not hesitate to do so. One reason that we have Finance Bill after Finance Bill is that a change is introduced to each one because someone in the country has found that he can do something in a way that was never intended. There are many clever people who spend
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
their time trying to avoid tax rather than getting on with the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire raised the important question of the effect on business. The great majority of small businesses borrow money directly from banks. That is a key fact because the accounting that occurs is mainly accruals accounting, although there are a few exceptions. When a small business borrows money from a bank, it is taxed on an accruals basis; its accounting and taxation therefore work together and work well. However, the minute that that business borrows money from somebody else, its accounting and taxation are no longer married. It still accounts on an accruals basis, but it is taxed on a "when paid" basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an ersatz example of what I mean, of which I have personal experience from when I worked in the constituency of the hon. Member for Rotherham. A company borrows £10,000, say, from a financial institution that is not a bank and then pays, say, 10 per cent. six months in arrears. That is not an unreasonable example. If the company borrowed its money in September, it would be eligible to pay £500 for the first time the following March. If that company's accounting year is from January to December, it has a problem, because it would be accounted for on an accrual basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the quarter between September and the end of its financial year in December, it will have an accrued interest liability of £250 in its account but it will not have paid anything. It does not pay until March. So, along comes the tax man, looks at the accounts and taxes the company, not on the basis of profits less the accrued £250 but on its total profits. That is the difficulty. Of course, the company catches up over the years but then it takes out another loan, and another. Thus, the system marries together only when it applies for direct borrowings from a bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said in reply to one of the points of order that was made on Tuesday that the majority of small businesses in this country will either not be affected or just touched by the legislation. The businesses that will not be affected are those with direct borrowings from banks. Those that will be touched will be those who perhaps have a mixture of borrowings from a bank and from another organisation. The effect on them will be beneficial, because at long last they will be able to pay tax on their accounts wherever they borrowed money from, rather than getting out of step as they do at the moment, because how one is taxed depends on where one borrows money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following carefully what the hon. Lady says and to some extent I accept it. I appreciate that there will be no change to the way in which most businesses do their accounts and pay their taxes. But, does not the Minister understand our point? Because the measure will impact on all those businesses whether they do their accounts on an accruals basis or not, it is important that we get it right. They will be constrained by the legislation even
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
though there will not be a need for any immediate change to the way in which they carry out their accounting. The legislation will apply to them, so it is important that it is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely correct to say that it is important for us to get the legislation right, but there is an error in the hon. Gentleman's point. In reality, countless small businesses that borrow money only from banks are not touched at all by the measure; those that borrow from somewhere other than a bank will actually benefit from that. That is a fundamental principle of great importance, which must colour our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic rules are, first, that the tax system should recognise all debit and credit that arise from borrowing and lending, although in more complex deals, it does not necessarily do that. Secondly, they should be calculated according to authorised accounting methods. We have spoken particularly of accruals because far and away the vast majority of businesses account in that way. Thirdly, the figures should follow those that are produced for non-tax purposes wherever they are acceptable. That may be bad news for my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, because it means one set of accounts and one set of principles. We cannot have the accounts saying one thing and the tax man saying another, which happens now to a certain extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving to a more simplified method of ensuring that debits, credits and taxation follow accounts. My hon. Friend mentioned some of the far more complicated ways of raising money by a variety of routes. They have provided accountants with a great deal of business, but they are no longer relevant. That is important for British industry because it means that it is cheaper and easier to raise money. This country will become more attractive to businesses. The clause simplifies our tax code, repeals some existing legislation and allows the strips gilts market to proceed. Those matters are of great importance to us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important question of how the clause will affect the larger company with more complex borrowing comes down to the first basic rule that tax should recognise all debits and credits arising from borrowing and lending. In the complex methods of funding, companies that borrow find that the costs of their borrowing are not totally accounted for when it comes to tax relief. I shall not give an example of that because there is not time: it is complicated and it would be better if it were written down. A company will benefit if it can be more certain that the costs of raising the finance it needs will be fully catered for in the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for winners and losers, with any reform there will be changes. This reform is not about raising additional tax revenue. We estimate its overall effect to be broadly neutral. It will undoubtedly benefit everyone in the long run in that it is more coherent. But one group of people who will certainly lose will be the people who have set up tax-driven
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
arrangements designed to profit at the Exchequer's expense from the weaknesses of the currency. We have not heard a word from any of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CBI, which is likely to have a considerable number of members who fall into the complex money-raising category, is very much in favour of these reforms. The gainers are clear: they are companies that currently sell bonds at a loss and will now get tax relief. The gainers are a minority of companies which will get tax relief on the borrowings of their costs earlier. We can be certain that the gainers will be small businesses and medium-sized companies that are getting into the more complicated side of financing or are already involved in fairly complicated deals, and the losers will be those who have been trying to fiddle the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister an estimate of the numbers affected in each of those categories?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not know the number who will be adversely affected because they have been using the existing legislation as a tax dodge. It may seem rather surprising, but they do not knock on the Treasury's door and say, "I say, you are stopping my tax dodge." We hear from the organisations that represent businesses that act fairly and properly. Those businesses and the organisations that represent them have welcomed the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of simpler language was raised. It is correct that many of the amendments may be small but they are designed to ensure that the Bill is in simpler language. On asymmetry and the transitional period, the valid points that were raised have been addressed in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire asked about Ernst and Young and project financing. Obviously, I would need to see the letter to give a precise answer, but I can provide him with the generality. If a company is accounting on an accruals basis and if a tax system is based on those accounts, accountants will have to be sufficiently confident that a profit will be received and treat it as such. If accountants have got it wrong and interest is not received, relief is available. That is a simplistic answer to the question, but that is the generality, as I said, of how the legislation will work. Later clauses will also deal with the important issue of finance for capital projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington argued that we need a dramatically simplified tax process. I agree that it would be good to achieve that. However, we may not have proceeded that far but I hope that he will agree that we have at least taken a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) was worried about the number of regulations and extra-statutory concessions that would follow. He is right to say that they are a feature of our present tax system. I hope that he will accept my opening statement when I said that the Revenue will give guidance on the interpretation of the law. Its guidance to staff will be published. If we need to make further
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
amendments we shall do so. The legislation is complicated, but it is also beneficial to industry. The amendments that we have tabled will help to make the legislation work well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the crucial issues of our debate has been the way in which the amendments have been rushed through by the Government. I put specific questions to the Economic Secretary about the briefing, but she has not answered them.

The hon. Gentleman and I spoke in the Corridor on Tuesday about consultation. I asked him if he wanted briefing from officials.
