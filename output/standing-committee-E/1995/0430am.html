As members of the Committee will be aware, the House has resolved to adjourn from Thursday 2 May until Tuesday 7 May. Because the House will not be sitting on bank holiday Monday, the preceding Friday, 3 May, does not, under Standing Order No. 11A(4), count as one of the 10 non-sitting Fridays for the purpose of tabling amendments. In order to be unstarred on Tuesday 7 May, amendments must be handed in by the rising of the House on Thursday 2 May, which is the day after tomorrow. Amendments tabled on that day will be printed, with a star, in the blue notice order published the following day. I hope that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING PARTS II AND III</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>25 April</i>]: No. 36, in page 1, leave out line 12 and insert—
	<br><q><p>"(i) encouraged to take all practicable steps to save the marriage, through marriage counselling or otherwise; and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(ii) made aware of the implications of a possible divorce for any children of the family; and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(iii) made aware of the financial implications of a possible divorce for the parties.".—[	<i>Mr. Leigh.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to have had a weekend to reflect on the matter that we were discussing last Thursday—and I still intend to be brief. You have been very tolerant, Sir Patrick, in allowing us to have a wide debate on the clause and the amendment because they strike at the base of the Bill. I welcome the principle that we should tackle the whole matter of family law on the basis that the present law is in a mess. What I especially welcome in clause 1 is the whole concept of having a declaration of what the Bill is about that will find its way into not only the thinking of judges, but of court welfare officers, mediators and family solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), which would broaden clause 1 by covering the issues that members on both sides of the Committee are concerned about and want to see as the driving force behind the Bill. I shall not repeat the various points made by my hon. Friend, except to say that I welcome all three of his suggestions on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
I regard the discussions on the amendments to clause 1 as a forerunner of the discussions that we shall have later on clause 6. They cover the role for marriage counselling and the importance of trying to impose a delay before the parties go straight into the machinery of divorce itself. The legal advice that we have received from many people who practice at the Bar is that divorce is not simply about when the piece of paper saying that a couple are divorced goes through, but about when the machinery starts to crank. Once the family home is broken up and various other arrangements are made, the divorce itself becomes little more than a piece of paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we bear in mind in our discussions the debate that will take place on clause 6, when I shall be strongly supporting the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle that a delay should be imposed and that there should be much better access to marriage counselling. It would be useful to have the general statements to which the amendment refers included in clause 1 as part of the guidance to the courts, the mediators and others as they set out how the rest of the Bill should be interpreted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am inclined to support the amendment, but I am worried about the reasons behind it. Is it a genuine attempt to help couples through a crisis or will it be another stumbling block intended to delay the inevitable, thus creating more misery and frustration? That, to some extent, depends on resources being made available and on the sort of conciliation or mediation that is offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, I was considering the difference between conciliation, reconciliation and mediation—three words that will not necessarily be interpreted in the usual way by courts and certainly not by lawyers, who seem to have their own interpretation of many English words. I am worried that we might support something that looks all right on paper but which, in practice, will cause more problems than it solves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will be offering such mediation? I agree that those people should be professionals, but where will we find them? What will be their mandate? Will they be told to put pressure on one or both of the parties to think and think again until that couple are so worried and upset by their consciences that they finally make the wrong decision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the amendment lists three so-called
	<br><q><p>"practical steps to save the marriage".</p></q>
I am not sure how practical those steps will be because they will not be spelt out in the Bill. I assume that guidelines will be issued about exactly what mediators can or cannot do. What are the "implications" of divorce for the children of the family? The third step is consider the "financial implications".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the implications of divorce for the family, I am not sure that anyone is qualified to make that sort of judgment and be certain that they are right. The children, quite naturally, may be upset at the time, which could make the couple feel so conscious of their actions that they withdraw from divorce. However, they may live to regret it as the marriage would not be desirable for bringing up a stable family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
The financial implications of divorce go right through the Bill. Is it possible to discuss the financial arrangements in mediation or conciliation sessions when everyone knows that waiting outside the consultation door is the Child Support Agency? I do not know whether financial arrangements could be made early in the process of deciding whether or not to divorce, but everyone knows that the CSA is there. That would certainly influence consultation or mediation. Unless we get rid of the CSA—which might not be a bad idea—I do not see how we can resolve some of the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that, after consultation, some couples decide to stay married for the sake of the children. Frankly, the advice that is given during consultation sometimes makes one feel that separating, for whatever reason, is a crime. I shall not go into detail, but for the sake of the children I waited 15 years before divorcing. I would not advocate that in general. Although it was not too bad, I am not certain that it was the right decision. Who can say? We cannot go back on our actions. We did not divorce until the children had left school. It seemed a sensible arrangement at the time—but if we asked the children, who are now in their 30s, whether they thought it was a good idea, I do not think that we would get a round of applause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the Bill, the original idea behind the conciliation procedure was to let couples think their way through matters, not to give guidance in any way, shape or form that would influence them. Everyone has his or her own opinion. Currently, lawyers decide that their clients should go for a divorce, saying "We'll get as much as we can—and by the way, that's another 300 quid on my bill." We do not want that, but neither do we want, in the mediation process, anyone preaching to a couple who are facing a crisis in their marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have reservations about how the amendment would work and whether there will be sufficient resources. If there are not the resources, not only will the amendment not make sense or be of any help, the whole Bill will be a disaster, just as the CSA has been. I shall monitor the arguments carefully. At present, I am inclined to support the amendment, but I have grave reservations about it and about much of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read the report of the previous sitting with great care and I understand what the amendment is about. However, those of us who have practical constituency and, indeed, family experience of the matter cannot imagine that anyone would take a step as serious as divorce without being aware of all the implications outlined in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have reservations about applying a generalised rule to individual cases. Many of us know people who are desperate to save their marriages and who have been persuaded to seek individual counselling to allay their fears and concerns and to show them that the situation is not as bad as they thought. Sometimes that has made matters worse as the one of the parties being counselled may believe that the counsellor, who is trying to explain something in a fair and dispassionate way, has taken sides against him or her and is not arguing in favour of what he or she feels is the case. I have known cases in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
which the bitterness increases because of individual counselling. If anyone tries to give dispassionate help and analysis in an adversarial situation, he can be seen as taking sides against a person who is seeking a divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be very careful about making sweeping generalisations. Everyone might agree with them on paper, but we should be wary of applying a generalised view to all the different and difficult cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Sir J. Lester), who expressed a clear desire to focus on individual cases. There is a real danger that we shall make broad assumptions and sweeping statements in the Bill. There should be humility in our approach as we could all say, "There but for the grace of God go I." Many of us have been down that route and felt the pain. We must avoid the temptation to preach; we must let people draw from their individual experiences and make their own decisions. The amendments to clause 1 are important as they signpost the way to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I broadly support amendment No. 36. Paragraph (i) states that people should be
	<br><q><p>"encouraged to take all practicable steps to save the marriage, through marriage counselling or otherwise".</p></q>
That is extremely important. One of the criticisms of the Bill is that a great deal of scope is given to the term "mediation", so I hope that during our deliberations we can examine that term closely. My view is that the terms "conciliation", "counselling" and "reconciliation" do not appear often enough in the Bill, which puts the focus on mediation. I want there to be an opportunity to set up processes that people will go through voluntarily to try to save their marriages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a real problem with the Bill because it is cost neutral. We are told that savings can be made from the legal aid budget that can be refocused on mediation—and, perhaps, reconciliation. I find that hard to believe. My experience of social policy and social change is that if major changes are made—and the Bill is certainly a major change—they cost money in the short term. There may be long-term savings, but in the first two years of putting the Bill into operation there will be transitional costs. I hope that the Minister will talk to us during our proceedings about the financial assumptions behind the Bill. I would be very worried if, when the Bill completes its passage, it is still considered to be cost neutral. Almost by definition, it will cost more in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to "marriage counselling". I am worried that we shall move from a system to end marriages that is primarily guided by the legal profession to one that makes greater use of counsellors and mediators. That raises a big resource issue. There are not enough qualified people at present. A great deal of work needs to be done, first to train people and, secondly, to ensure that sufficient resources are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our previous sitting much was said about appropriate, well-qualified, professional people being available. That was contrasted with what was called an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
Auntie Wu approach to counselling. Perhaps I come from the Auntie Wu tradition of counselling, but in my experience marriage counsellors and mediators are, by and large, white, middle-aged, well educated and professional. That creates a stumbling-block that prevents some people from taking part in such services. We must consider the matter more widely. My experience of working with community groups and voluntary organisations suggests that we can add value to people—we can train, dare I call them, "ordinary" people and give them expertise. They may not be able to perform a totally professional job, but they can offer support and help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be a little chary of any move to a highly professional counselling service. I know that organisations such as Relate aspire to that and achieve it, but we need to encourage other people, including from the black and Asian communities to come forward to give counselling. Very few people from those communities work as counsellors for Relate. We need to work hard at that problem and that, too, raises a resource issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real danger of confusing our terms. The Bill is underpinned by the notion of mediation. As I understand it, mediation is a process in which parties can engage to find a way out of their difficulties and to discuss the practicalities of resolving them. Some people might want to take that approach; others will want to have family counselling, which is different from mediation. It is a process in which people come together, talk and consider positive, practical steps to try to save their marriages. I want to see more about that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the Bill is about the mediation process—the practical steps to get out of a marriage. I want to see more in the Bill about marital counselling and reconciliation. There will always be other people who require another sort of counselling—divorce counselling. Coming out of a relationship is painful. Even when the practical matters are sorted out through mediation, people feel much hurt and pain. Those people need support, too, so there is a need for divorce counselling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are issues for the professionals, for people such as Relate and other counselling organisations. However, they are also important issues for us. In essence, we must make the resources available. Clearly, the Government cannot deal with such matters. First, they must use the powers of grant aid in the Bill to put money into making the system work to save marriages. Secondly, time must be given to allow resources to be built up so that professionals can be put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of that happens at the end of marriages, but the most important part of clause 1—the key principle of the Bill—is
	<br><q><p>"that the institution of marriage is to be supported."</p></q>
That headline statement appears at the beginning of the Bill, but there is little in subsequent clauses to support it. The Bill depresses me because it has been referred to as a Bill about saving marriages that should be saved. If we are serious about saving marriages, we should do much work at the start of marriages, not at the end of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
I am concerned that all political parties seem to treat family policy as a bolt-on—a tagged-on extra. In a sense, families are the key to our society both for us and for future generations. I should like this and future Governments to focus on the family and to create a ministerial group that works together, draws civil servants together and puts forward punchy and positive proposals to promote marriage, partnerships and the bringing up of children. The Bill is devoid of that. I should like to see much more work done on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 36 deals with the importance of making people
	<br><q><p>"aware of the implications of a possible divorce for any children of the family".</p></q>
It is often said that children are the losers in separation and divorce. I hope that we shall support the amendment and that we shall consider ways to protect and enhance the rights of children. The law is clear—the interests of the child should be paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall consider the work that, for example, family court officers could do to hear the voices of children. Children have a right to be heard when they are involved in separations. The difficulty is to know how that should be done. Although there will be some feelings and tensions, the problem is not so great for older children—at least there is a system for allowing them to be heard. However, the problem is more difficult when dealing with younger children. I hope that during our discussions we will consider amendments that will protect the right of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier sitting the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) was kind enough to speak about the work of family centres. That work demonstrates that family policy must be worked out at both national and local level. We must listen to the voices of children. The work in Nottingham, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, clearly demonstrates that, with adequate resources and good professional help, families can be kept together. Children could be kept with their families. My experience working at the centre showed that over a period of two years, with intensive help and support for families, children were not taken into care on that estate. Before the family centre was established on the estate, eight children a year were coming into care. The work of the family centre reduced that to one child coming into care over a period of two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important for the child and the family. It is also important to us as legislators—first, because of the social issues involved, and secondly, in terms of a cost-benefit analysis. It costs more than £200 a week to keep a child in care. By making resources available and investing in the family and in children, by good preparation and by looking to the future, we can support partnerships and the institution of marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I hope we will get from the Bill. There is a great deal of amendment to be done, from clause 1 to the last clause, to ensure that the Bill focuses on families, helps them to survive if they can survive and have the will to survive, and gives a careful, thoughtful and helpful way out to people who face difficult and painful situations after they have reluctantly decided to end a relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Roche 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornsey and Wood Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to pick up some of the points raised—extremely well, if I may say so—be my hon. Friends the Members for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) and for Sheffield Heeley (Mr. Michie).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the interesting aspects of the Bill is that, because of the deliberations in another place, it provides an opportunity for us to discuss the broad principles underlying it. That is rather unusual. When we discuss legislation, we generally discuss the clauses immediately, rather than debating the fundamental principles behind it. The Opposition—and also, I am sure, the Government—welcome the amendment made in the other place to enable us to discuss the broad framework of the Bill. This amendment allows us to discuss further some of those broad principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin where my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood ended—by talking about children. The amendment requires us to consider the effect of divorce on children. There are many differing views on the Bill, but during the Second Reading debate and during the Committee stage on the Floor of the House, when we considered time periods and fault in the context of clauses 5 and 7, there was a great deal of discussion about the role of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we conduct this stage of the proceedings, we should bear in mind one terrible fact that goes to the heart of the Bill: about two years after some divorce, 50 per cent. of fathers lose contact with their children. That is so distressing for children, many of whom grow up without a male role model and without access to a male members of the family who can provide an important model in life not only to boys and young men but to girls and young women, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In thoroughly agreeing with the hon. Lady's remarks, may I ask her to join me in welcoming the amendments moved in the other place by my noble friend, Lady Elles, which were accepted by the Government, making it a requirement for the first time that, before a divorce is granted, the court must consider what access arrangements have been provided for the other parent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall need to look at that matter, although it is not exactly novel. I remember when I was a young barrister—rather more years ago that I would care to say—going to court under the old procedure to attend for a brief but effective ceremony to discuss section 41 arrangements for children. Such provisions are not exactly new, so I should like to take time to consider how they will work. However, I agree that this is an important matter to which the Committee should give a great deal of time and attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it true that fathers often lose contact not because of a court order but because the structure and process of the divorce has caused people to lose the ability to keep in touch?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree. The difficulty with the old fault grounds for divorce, such as adultery or intolerable behaviour, when irretrievable breakdown had to be proved, meant that the other party's conduct
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
was scrutinised. Another problem with the law as it stands is that all the other ancillary matters must be dealt with after the divorce, which leads to bitterness and conflict. Clearly, there are reasons why fathers lose contact, but often it is because the nature of the proceedings have been so intolerable that there is a legacy of bitterness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Jim Lester</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with everything that the hon. Lady has been saying, but even under the current system, satisfactory arrangements can be made by the court or between the parties. However, difficulties arise when one party chooses not to implement those arrangements. In my constituency there are fathers who are desperately anxious to maintain contact with their children but their former wives prevaricate to such a degree and cause so much difficulty that it is almost impossible for the court to insist that the order be carried out. If there is a more amicable arrangement in the first place and it is accepted that all children need both parents, perhaps the difficulties involving one party preventing the other from seeing the children will be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal in what the hon. Gentleman says, but we cannot legislate for human behaviour when the two parties are determined not to get on, however much we discuss the matter and however careful we try to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be discussing circumstances in which there has been horrendous domestic violence against one spouse, usually, and unfortunately in our society, against the wife. In addition, where there has been violence against the children or horrendous abuse, contact should be severed because it would not be practical or safe. We must aim to create as little bitterness as possible so that the future interests of the children can be safeguarded. I welcome our debate on the underlying principles so that we can do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also mentions counselling. I am sure that as we debate the Bill we shall try fully to identify the difference between counselling and mediation. I should be interested to hear the Minister address the source of one of my great fears. What exactly is mediation, how do we define it and how does the work of a mediator differ from that of a counsellor? Of course we have our own ideas on those issues based on what we see in our constituencies. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood rightly mentioned the work of family centres, and we are familiar with their good work. However, because the Bill relies so heavily on mediation, we need to spell out in great detail what we mean by it. Many questions arise as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mediators are impartial: they are not like lawyers, who identify and advocate the needs of their clients. They adopt a balance. That may be fine and helpful in an equal situation, but when the situation is unequal there could be difficulties, which is why access to proper legal advice must be safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem, to which the Opposition will return time and again, relates to resources. As my hon. Friends the Members for Sherwood and for Heeley said, the measure is meant to be cost neutral. I have some difficulty in seeing how that can be so when what is required is a nationwide system of mediators. But the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
scale of action envisaged by the Bill does not allow for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might interest the hon. Lady to know that in north Wales, for example, in the county of Clwyd there are eight or 12 mediators while in Gwynedd there are two or three. Unless much effort and many resources are put in, the whole core purpose of the Bill may fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that graphic illustration. The other difficulty is that the Bill's provisions will not be implemented for two years, although there will be some pilot schemes. The Bill is unusual. We are debating the setting up of a system to replace existing legislation but we do not know the detail of that replacement system. That is a cause for some anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is unwise to assume, if anybody is doing that, that mediation will be a cheap option, a way to cut funding for legal representation and advice? Mediation may be quite expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. People may be in a process of mediation and then leave it to seek legal advice before returning to the process. We need to go into considerable detail about how the legislation will work. We all want to do the best for the children, and we are all resolved to make sure that there is as little bitterness as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need answers to some crucial questions, and I look forward to the Minister explaining the background to mediation and its difference from conciliation and marriage guidance. How will the measure work in principle? He must bear in mind what we have said about the rights of the children. How will the Bill's provisions be funded, because issues of cost are crucial? Without answers to such questions, we may set up a system that will cause great difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by saying something about the principles clause. As the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) said, it is rare to begin legislation with a principles clause; most legislation deals with the detail of what we are endeavouring to bring within the law. As I understand it, the precedent was set in Bills of a constitutional nature, but there have been a couple of examples of principles clauses in more recent years—most notably, in the Legal Aid Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should explain how a principles clause came to be included in the Bill. Members of the Committee will be aware that some people—outside, rather than within the House, I hope—have portrayed the Bill as damaging to the institution of marriage, and have claimed that that was one of the purposes of the Law Commission's initial proposals for legislative change in this area, made at the beginning of the 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill was considered in the other place, two Members of that House proposed that key principles contained in the White Paper published by the Lord Chancellor should be incorporated in the Bill, in order that there should be no doubt about the Bill's purpose.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
The argument was that that would help the courts and others who exercise functions under the Bill to understand its principles. Clause 1 states:
	<br><q><p>"The court and any person, in exercising functions under or in consequence of Parts II and III, shall have regard to the following general principles".</p></q>
I would hope that the principles contained in the Bill are generally unobjectionable. That was the view in the other place, and I am sure that anyone who reads the list in clause 1 would also take that view. You, Sir Patrick, have said that you are prepared to let us have a wide-ranging debate that considers not only the amendment but the general principles of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I answer the charge that it was hoped that the Government would, on reconsideration, feel that the inclusion of clause 1 improved the Bill? Although it is correct to say that two Members of the other place introduced a principles clause, the clause now in the Bill was drafted by the Lord Chancellor's Department and proposed by the Lord Chancellor. I certainly give due credit to those Members of the other place who raised the issue, but there is no doubt that the Lord Chancellor and I have supported the insertion of a principles clause in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we come to the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle to elevate, rightly, the position of marriage counselling within the principles clause. I listened with great care to the debate on the clause today and previously. One clear message emerged from all the speeches, even that of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley, who was the only hon. Member to question whether the elements of the amendment were always valuable. I take on board many of the sentiments and cautions that the hon. Gentleman outlined, but virtually every other hon. Member has spoken strongly in favour of elevating marriage counselling and having it mentioned in the principles clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much in the Bill that supports the concept of marriage counselling. We heard on Second Reading and in some of the speeches in Committee that hon. Members want marriage counselling elevated even more, in specific detail. In due course we will debate some of the proposals, such as that under clause 6 to introduce the concept of a mandatory meeting with a marriage counsellor. Of course, Sir Patrick, you would not wish me at this point to deal specifically with those amendments, but the fact that they appear at all is a clear indication that the issue is bound to arise during the debate on that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of the outcome of that debate, I would argue that the new structure, which is a key part of the Bill, does significantly more to channel people towards marriage counselling than does our current system of law. Whatever views hon. Members may have taken in relation to the debates that we had in the Committee of the whole House, when considering the detail of the Bill most members of the Committee will see that that is a likely outcome. It is certainly the Government's view that introducing a period of time for reflection and consideration will broaden the period when people can reflect on the possible financial consequences of divorce and the effect on their children. That factor will also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
provide greater opportunities for people to take advantage of marriage counselling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board the Committee's view that marriage counselling should be elevated and mentioned in clause 1. I have more difficulty in accepting the other two proposals in the amendment. Paragraph (i) states that couples should be
	<br><q><p>"encouraged to take all practicable steps to save the marriage, through marriage counselling or otherwise".</p></q>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray) all suggested that marriage counselling may not be the only way of supporting those who are going through that trauma. It must be clear that, although marriage counselling would be elevated by being mentioned in clause 1, it should not be seen as the only means of delivering such assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the amendment present greater difficulty. As they are currently drafted, it is my interpretation of them that they might place a responsibility on the court or any party to consider the specific implications of divorce for any individual children of the family and the specific financial implications of the possible divorce for the parties. The implications of divorce are likely to differ with individual sets of circumstances. The issues are complex, especially where children are involved, and will vary greatly according to personal circumstances and, possibly, even according to future choices about remarriage and matters of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principles clause places a responsibility on the
	<br><q><p>"court and any person, in exercising functions under or in consequence of Parts II and III"</p></q>
of the Bill to have regard to the principles set out. In that context I should be more comfortable with a general responsibility to have regard to the implications of divorce—financially and for children—than with the imposition of a specific responsibility in each individual case. Within the context of clause 1 the legislation must be workable in practice. I recommend the view that an amendment that meets the general requirement that I have described is likely to be more workable in practice than the detailed amendment before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an early stage of our debates, hon. Members said that we must proceed by consensus as much as possible. It is interesting that, so early in our deliberations, we have achieved such a consensus in the Committee with regard to the mention of marriage counselling in clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement about wanting to elevate the issue of marriage counselling by its inclusion in the principles clause. However, he said that he wanted the measure to be workable in practice. Will he comment generally on whether the Government have thought about the resource, training and financial implications of bringing more marriage counselling into the process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should be aware that in the Bill already the Lord Chancellor's Department is to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
be given responsibility for funding marriage guidance. No Government Department has had that power previously. For all that has been said over the years in debates on social policy about the need to support marriage, there has been no past Government of any political persuasion who have previously placed that function in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opportunities will arise later for us to consider ways in which marriage guidance services may be made more a part of the process. However, the thrust of the point that is being made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is that that element should be elevated to be one of the principles of the Bill. I have taken on board the consensus view that has been expressed in debate. I hope that it will be possible to construct an amendment to deal generally rather than specifically with the matters that, if amendment No. 36 were passed, would be dealt with in clause 1(b)(ii) and (iii). If that could be achieved, the Bill might well be improved. I am prepared to consider the matter further and to try to have my hon. Friend's amendment varied to accommodate my concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's Herculean striving to achieve a consensus with the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is noted on this side of the Committee. One is bound to say that it is hardly surprising, bearing in mind the mathematics. Nevertheless, we hope that we shall not be disappointed when we debate other amendments. Indeed, we trust that there will be a similar Herculean striving for consensus when we debate another amendment later today. We hope that consensus will not be limited to one side of the Committee. However, I do not want to sound churlish. Far be it from me to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's speech because it showed that it is important to include in the part of the Bill that applies specifically to general principles a recognition of the importance of marital counselling. However, my hon. Friends have raised a number of issues that require some emphasis, but which, sadly, the Minister did not address in his speech. There are cost implications. We recognise that we shall in due course be able to deal in specific detail with provisions on mediation and counselling; however, it would assist us if the Minister could give an indication in advance of the Department's thinking regarding the costs arising from the provisions on mediation in particular. We must presume that some sums have been done. If not, how can there be a broad assertion in the Bill that it is cost neutral? I share the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green and other hon. Members about how that can be so unless it is intended to reduce access to legal aid and assistance for the purposes of advice and representation. If that is so, the points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Hallam—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Heeley, but we will win Hallam next time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I anticipate that happy event. As I was saying, the points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Heeley and for Sherwood would have particular effect. We do not believe that either mediation or counselling provides a happy panacea for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
all marital ills. That is not the case and we would be deluding ourselves if we allowed our very real enthusiasm for counselling and meditation to take us down that particular path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should, on another occasion, go into more detail as to exactly what we mean by marital counselling. My hon. Friend the Member for Heeley is right about the importance of definition. Relate has done some important work in that regard and has recently produced a checklist that includes the exploration of the realities of staying together and reflecting on whether the marriage has ended or not. That is fine and important. There are also some useful indicators regarding mediation, such as reaching agreement on financial and property arrangements on the basis of full disclosure and with the support of legal advisers. That definition is interesting because the Government have not yet accepted it. There is no clear indication in the Bill that legal advisers will be available to support the process of mediation. In due course, we shall explore how that matter can be clarified because that is absolutely essential if the points made about the disparity of power are to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who believes that two parties undertake mediation with equal power is living in cloud cuckoo land. All too often in the course of marital relationships, especially those which are in crisis and where divorce is anticipated, there is a pattern of oppression. I am not entirely clear about the role of the mediator in addressing such oppression. We want to explore how that oppression can best be lifted and just outcomes produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is open to correction and elucidation during the sittings of the Committee. We shall all go through that process and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood said, humility is required. However, I am not sure that mediation is designed to produce just outcomes. I understand that it is designed to produce a settled outcome, which is not the same thing. There must always be a capacity to ensure that the interests of justice are met in the terms of the dissolution of marriages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am paying attention to what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I am sure that he would agree that justice for the children is an important element. Too often, the interests of the children are put well down the agenda in order to produce a settled settlement between the adults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with the hon. Gentleman, which is why we shall move amendments designed specifically to deal with the needs of children and to tease out how those interests will be met in the mediation process. Obviously, marriage counselling has a role to play in the broad interests of children and in saving marriages that can be saved. I make absolutely no apology for using that formula. Yesterday, in the columns of one of our more distinguished newspapers, I noticed that that was described as a phrase that was perhaps less than felicitous—to put it kindly. We have a duty to find out how to save marriages that are capable of being saved. That duty is not easy, it is onerous. All members of the Committee take it very seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are back to the nitty-gritty of what we mean, especially about the benefit to children. I hope that we are not drifting down a path towards the idea that consultation and mediation is paramount to save marriages where possible. I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). We are talking about what is best for the children and it might sometimes be best to agree that a marraige should be abandoned for the sake of the children. I hope that both will be possible. Rather than putting marriage first and children second, it is more important to concentrate on the children and the finances than on the concept of marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. A delicate balance should be struck. It is a further reason for an independent voice to speak for the children and to assess the impact on the children of what has been agreed between the parties. That voice should be made known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his earlier remarks, my hon. Friend the Member for Heeley struck an important note—one that we needed to hear. It was a slightly discordant note, as the Minister pointed out, but there are times when a note of scepticism is needed. We welcome the Minister's acceptance in principle of elevating marital counselling, but we must be wary of coming to believe that the creation of yet another group of professionals will, of itself, deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we understand what is meant by "mediator" and "counsellor"—we shall be exploring that later—because proper accreditation is important. It seems that public funds will be expended and accountability and value for money are important. I am the first to introduce that matter into our debates, but we shall hear of it quite often because it is important not to create a new cornucopia or a great trough from which parties may gain sustenance. That will not be the case; there will be proper funding for services with a clear and established value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In due course we shall discuss the pilot projects. A number of hon. Members are concerned about the time being given to pilot projects and we want to tease out why the Government concluded that two years was long enough. We want to ensure that they have value. We agree on the broad principles, but much work is still to be done on the detail. We have to flesh out those principles and give them real meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process in which we are engaged is based on important messages. The first two objectives mentioned in the White Paper were to support the institution of marriage and to introduce practical steps to prevent the irretrievable breakdown of marriage. The desire to support the institution of marriage is not new. Every piece of divorce law and reform since the 18th century has claimed to support the institution of marriage. It would have been surprising if the Bill made any other claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, during the same period, the institution of marriage has undergone a considerable transformation—some of that potentially for the better; some of it, obviously, for the worse. The transformation is potentially for the better, in that we have moved on from the classic expression of the assumptions

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bound to be a relation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps. The case was held in 1790, and reported at page 467 of "English Reports", 161.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that the Minister recalls the case from his many years in practice. It is worth reading what Lord Scott said because there may be some people who still hanker after his assumption. He said:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle balks at that, although I see one Conservative Member standing—perhaps to give that statement his approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not clear whether the hon. Gentleman was addressing his remarks to new Labour or to old Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never you mind. The distinction between new Labour and old Labour is well understood by the electorate to whom it is addressed, whether or not it is understood by Conservative Members.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must not trespass on your indulgence, Sir Patrick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one approach—one that I do not think that the Committee would propose. A more contemporary approach which is at the opposite extreme comes from a source dated 20 March 1996, in an august daily organ—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lord Justice Scott?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Polly Toynbee, who says:
	<br><q><p>"Instead of guilt and worry, there should be a celebration of divorce, the single greatest liberator of this century."</p></q>
That is not a view that I feel able to share, although the author has the grace to add that
	<br><q><p>"we are living in the midst of a social revolution whose ending we do not know".</p></q>
Cold comfort there, when we consider the impact of divorce upon our national life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two extremes of opinion; there must be another way—a proper course between those two extremes. I hope that in the course of our deliberations we shall build upon the principle that has been accepted by the Minister—and upon the principle that we shall debate later today—and find that middle and proper way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good debate; I think everybody agrees about that. Perhaps that is due to your wise counsel, Sir Patrick. We have certainly achieved something today. It is seldom in the House that consensus, reason and mathematics walk together in creative harmony, but they appear to have done so today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying to the debate, my Learned Friend the Minister intimated that he was broadly happy with my amendment. He wanted, in particular, to accept that its trust would elevate marriage counselling to the heart of the Bill and put it in its preamble. I am trying to convert the Bill from one that facilitates divorce into one to save marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister will have the chance to respond to me in a moment, but I understood that he was happy with paragraph (i)—in other words, that the parties be
	<br><q><p>"encouraged to take all practicable steps to save the marriage, through marriage counselling or otherwise".</p></q>
He was also happy with the thrust of paragraph (ii) that the parties are
	<br><q><p>"made aware of the implications of a possible divorce"</p></q>
for children of the family. I could meet my hon. Friend's concern by removing the word "any" from the amendment, to make it more in line with the general words of the preamble. He said that he was also happy with paragraph (iii), which sets out that the courts, in exercising their functions, should be
	<br><q><p>"made aware of the financial implications of a possible divorce for the parties".</p></q>
However, my hon. Friend was worried about the last three words "for the parties".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that one way in which to achieve my objective would be by way of a manuscript amendment, but I accept that there might be complications in trying to redraft measures on the hoof, as it were. I am happy to withdraw the amendment, provided that I receive an undertaking from my hon. Friend the Minister that, if I were to re-submit it on Report along the lines that I have suggested, the Government would support it. If my hon. Friend is happy to give such an undertaking, we will have achieved a great deal in what is the first debate in Committee. A consensus would then have been reached and marriage counselling would be elevated to an important place in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 1, line 22, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(iv) with due regard to the need to avoid the risk of violence being directed at either or both parties or any children affected".</p></q>
We seek to place as a guiding principle of the Bill the need to have due regard to
	<br><q><p>"avoid the risk of violence being directed at either or both parties or any children affected"</p></q>
by the process. The amendment is the result of an escalation in the incidence of domestic violence. There are more than 500,000 separate incidents of violence in the home each year. Fear of domestic violence is a fact of life for many people. It is estimated that one in five of the women who live alone in inner cities, and one in 20 of all women, fear violence in the home. Violence in the home accounts for the majority of attacks on women and seven out of 10 women victims of violent crime know their attacker very well. That presents a truly horrific picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are addressing, in particular, the experiences of parties who are in the course of divorce. When we examine the break-up of marriage and the impact of violence in the home, all too often we find that the parties to a divorce and their children are proceeding in the context of violence and the fear of violence. Therefore, any attempt to address the issue of divorce and the proceedings that form a part of the termination of marriage must be founded on a recognition of the reality of people's experiences as they go through a marital crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes new and untried solutions—if one dare use that word in the context of the complexities and difficulties that attach to the law in this area. We must have regard to the law's effective capacity to terminate marriages in a safe way, which maximises the potential for future contact between the child and its parents and which enables the parties to found other successful partnerships. There is often a real imbalance of power in terms of financial and domestic arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He is right to raise concerns, but will he also give some thought to the position of a mother leaving a violent home with her children and setting up home with someone new? Those children may suffer a second time because they are not the children of that new partner. I have seen that happen and often such a partner takes out his violence on the children rather than on the mother. We must look carefully at the problems facing those who move from one setting of violence to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to keep that point in mind. Perhaps I may complete my train of thought. We must take into account the impact of violence on the parties and their children in terms of their future arrangements. The hon. Lady mentions one such future arrangement. Anyone who has practised in this field and has had anything to do with the support of families in the grip of domestic violence knows that throughout some people's lives there tends to be a pattern of oppression and violence. One abused party will often go on to another
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
situation in which the pattern of abuse is replicated against that party and his or her children. I can remember, as no doubt others can from their work, sometimes feeling despair knowing that having obtained an injunction and gone on to obtain a divorce, the chances were that the same person would be back within months because of problems with a new relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spiral of violence must be broken. That is why it is important that at every stage in the process:
	<br><q><p>"The court and any person, in exercising functions under or in consequence of Parts II and III"</p></q>
should have regard to the impact of their decision and their action on the family situation, in the context of violence. The court, the judge, lawyers, mediators, counsellors—any party who exercises any function under the Bill, and even the Lord Chancellor when promulgating regulations—should have in mind the impact on the family in terms of violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great sympathy to what the hon. Gentleman says—it is very well directed—but why is such an amendment necessary? Everything that he has said so far is implicit in existing law. Violence is fully covered by the criminal law. Why is it necessary for the hon. Gentleman to move an amendment making that explicit in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The matter is implicit, but the experience of those working in this area is that that is not good enough; it must be made explicit. The Royal College of Nursing, for example, as a matter of policy has circulated all members with its concerns about domestic violence. The experience of the Women's Aid Federation and a host of other organisations working in the area is that it is necessary to make explicit in our law the principle enshrined in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the reasons why it is important to make the matter explicit in the Bill is not so much to punish the perpetrators of domestic violence as to ensure that the various agencies involved take action to prevent domestic violence from occurring? That would promote the interests of the family and prevent divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend. She is a Friend and a Member, and long may she continue to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady highlighted the importance of interagency co-operation. In its circular of September 1994 the Home Office stressed the importance of just such an approach. One of the points stressed in the circular was that only about a fifth of all domestic violence incidents ae reported to the police. My hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) talks of the matter not simply as an issue of punishment, which it is not; it is primarily as dealt with by the amendment—an issue of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all the more reason to ensure that all the agencies working under the aegis of the Bill have to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
take the issue into account when they exercise their functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to disturb the development of the hon. Gentleman's argument and, in the spirit of consensus that I spoke of earlier, am keen to learn how the amendment would affect specific functions under parts II and III of the Bill. Part IV of the Bill incorporates a range of new measures and the consolidation of existing measures to deal with domestic violence, which is a core aspect of the Bill and a reason why it is generally supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the principles clause applies to parts II and III. There would be an impact in some areas, but they are limited. To help the hon. Gentleman—I am mindful that interventions must not last too long—might I suggest an order under clause 10 or under the provisions in the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle which was agreed to the other day? What other areas does the hon. Gentleman think that the change might impact upon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is important for the Lord Chancellor's Department to bear in mind. The Department will have a responsibility to promulgate regulations on how information sessions should be carried out. A major worry of some groups working in this area is that information should not be given in a way that puts at risk a party who has already been subject to domestic violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen women assaulted outside the court—no doubt other hon. Members will have had the same experience—as well as on their way to, and inside, the court. A few weeks ago, a member of my chambers was assaulted in the court, because the battering husband believed that he was being too vigilant on behalf of the spouse. Abusive conduct will occur at every and any opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is absolutely no doubt that the vast majority of violence is against women, but does not the hon. Gentleman agree that there is an increasingly worrying trend here? Perhaps as part of the movement toward greater equality between the sexes, there has been a considerable increase in the amount of violence perpetrated by women as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Violence, whether against women by men or against men by women, is to be deprecated. But this is one occasion on which I use the word "she" in what can be described as a gender neutral way. Why is it that "he" is always gender neutral but "she" never is? That is funny, but it is one of the strange phenomena of the language with which we live. The hon. Gentleman's point is well made and taken—patterns of violence change, but domestic violence is overwhelmingly by men against women and children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Peacock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware also of the difficulties in court cases where charges of violence are brought, but the battered wife or partner stands up in court and says that she will take the man back. The court is therefore left to decide whether it will do any good to send him to prison or punish him for that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
violence. That often happens more than once and the wife or partner knows that, inevitably, she is returning to a repeat pattern of violence. It is difficult to decide how to tackle that situation and whether to punish the man or allow the violence to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right to say that that problem occurs day in and day out. In such a relationship a fonn of dependence develops in which the violence goes on and on. That is extremely distressing. That dependence is made worse in some instances by financial dependence and in others by a need to keep a roof over one's head. That is why it is so important that when people who exercise functions under the Bill make decisions, they bear in mind the impact of their decisions on violent situations. That is an example, in the promulgation of regulations, of how the Lord Chancellor needs to keep the principle in his legislation in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to continue at great length, but I can think of other examples, such as the role of mediators. The Bill requires mediators to consider, for example, whether mediation is appropriate. I do not see anywhere in the Bill any indication that the Government are prepared to concede the principle—one that I increasingly support—that mediation is never appropriate in situations of domestic violence. I have almost come to that conclusion. Because of his professional advice, the Minister may not yet be able to come to that conclusion. That is all the more reason for having that principle enshrined in the Bill. It would then become a factor that the mediator was duty bound to take into account when proffering advice on whether mediation would be appropriate. The Legal Aid Board also needs to take into account in its decision-making processes the impact of violence on the parties and their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have given the Minister some indication of why it is necessary to write that provision into the Bill. It is a recognition that our deliberations and decisions about the Bill must be based on what happens in marriages and domestic relationships. There is violence—and the incidence seems to be growing, not abating. If we are to succeed in our objectives for the Bill, our deliberations must reflect the fact that all stages of the process must take into account the safety issues that go to the heart of families' welfare—the right of the parties and their children to live free from violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a genuine dilemma about the amendment. It seems, on the face of it, perfectly sensible to put in the Bill a provision about the need to avoid the risk of violence. There has been reference to part IV of the Bill, which contains draconian powers. There is concern in some quarters that those powers could be used unfairly to eject a man from his home in the early part of divorce proceedings. There may be fears that the hon. Gentleman's proposal will add to those powers in some way. Perhaps he could reassure me on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall be coming to part IV in due course. The Minister has made the point that this section of the Bill deals specifically with parts II and III. Those are the limited areas to which this principle is attached.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
The amendment is designed to ensure that all those exercising functions under parts II and III of the Bill—the courts, the Lord Chancellor, the mediators, the Legal Aid Board and counsellors—bear in mind the need for the avoidance of violence towards the parties and their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear what the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle says. The amendment is drafted in a way that makes it clear that we are concerned not only with the relationship between the man and the woman and that between the man, the woman and the children, but with any violence that may be directed at either or both of them and/or their children. In family feuds and disagreements, it is possible for violence to be directed by the relatives of the man or woman at the other spouse, male or female. The amendment is designed not to make a judgment between men and women, but to recognise the phenomenon of violence in domestic relationships in the family and marriage, and to deal specifically with the limited area that falls between parts II and III of the Bill. It does not touch part IV at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would help, in explaining the current position to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, if the hon. Gentleman told us what powers are currently available, and in what circumstances they can be used, to curb men who are violent towards their spouse or partner. As the hon. Gentleman knows, powers to impose non-molestation orders, for example, are already available to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean to be discourteous, but I think that the hon. Gentleman has missed the point. We are talking not about the content of part IV of the Bill, but the principle that people must take into account when exercising functions under parts II and III. They will take into account the remedies that are available through the use of injunctions, ousting or the criminal process. Under the amendment, the existence of violence within the family and the home should also be taken into account. So the amendment would do no more in relation to parts II and III than to require people making decisions to do precisely what the Minister has asked me to do—to take into account violence within the home and the adequacy of existing remedies for it. It is not a question of extending new powers; so I do not have to justify the amendment by considering the old powers. I hope that both sides of the Committee share a principled opposition to violence which must guide us when considering the operation of functions under parts II and III of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>Several hon. Members	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before calling the next speaker, may I make a brief observation? Interventions should be designed to elucidate specific points, not to conduct a debate within a speech, which makes our proceedings a little unwieldy. The great virtue of Committee proceedings is that, within reason, Members of the Committee can speak as often as they wish. It is not helpful to have interventions that are too lengthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment because it is important to focus on the fact that domestic violence is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
not just an issue of occupation of the family home and immediate protection from violence for families but one that should permeate the thinking of all of those involved in the divorce process. The amendment would focus the attention of such people on the implications and existence of domestic violence. It is amazing how often constituents come to our advice surgeries with problems about housing, but if we scratch the surface, we discover that domestic violence lies at the heart of their problem. Some hon. Members may not have worked that out, but it is often the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last November, I went to Downing Street with people from The Body Shop. We presented a petition on the issue of domestic violence. There are quite a few outlets of The Body Shop in the United Kingdom, but not as many as there are of Marks and Spencer or Tesco. Even so, during three weeks, 723,000 customers of The Body Shop signed that petition, which was available on tables in each store. That is a remarkable sign of protest against domestic violence in this country. The campaign was entitled, "One in Five", because it is estimated that one in five women are victims of domestic violence. The petition stated:
	<br><q><p>"For millions of women around the world, home is a battlefield. They are the sufferers of a secret war that is either ignored or accepted by the societies in which we live."</p></q>
I was joined at the presentation of that petition by my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Ms Jowell), who is Labour's spokesperson for women, and by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Miss Nicholson), who was then a Conservative Member, but is now in another party. So the one Tory Member who attended is no longer a Tory [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The political allegiance of an hon. Member who is not a member of the Committee is wholly irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Sir Patrick. I thought that it might he useful information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who else was invited? Many other hon. Members might have supported the petition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was told by The Body Shop that it had gone to significant lengths to try to interest Conservative women; it had asked women Members of Parliament, and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon was the only Conservative to respond. [Hon. Members: "Why did they not invite more people"] Well, that is a matter for The Body Shop.

The popular perception of violent crime against women is of assault by a stranger in the street. Women are often told to be careful when they go out at night, to avoid walking in unlit places or under bridges and to be careful what bus they catch. However, of the 999,000 reported assaults against women in 1991, almost half were classified as domestic incidents. We are therefore talking of 500,000 incidents, but it is estimated that only 2 per cent. of violent attacks on women are reported to the police, so there must be a huge, almost unimaginable scale of violence in the home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That violence can have the most tragic consequences. Only a few weeks ago in Bristol a woman and her children were murdered by her partner the day after she instituted domestic proceedings. I was told by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
Women's Aid Federation that a similar incident happened a few weeks ago in Trowbridge in Wiltshire—a woman and her children were killed by her partner, the father of the children, shortly after the institution of proceedings. As far as I know, neither the police nor the Home Office keep statistics, but such murders may not be as unusual as we might believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Domestic violence accounts for four times as many violent assaults on women as mugging, but it does not hit the news in quite the same way. It is important to recognise the effect of violence on women and young girls. The Council of Europe and the United Nations both recognise that domestic violence is a fundamental barrier to women's equality. Both organisations have confirmed the right of children to be protected from violence and abuse. We should consider the impact of domestic violence on young people. Schemes to reduce bullying and harassment in schools may be effective in preventing that form of behaviour continuing in adult life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British crime surveys estimates that 530,000 assaults on women in the home occur each year. In 90 per cent. of cases, the children of the family are in the same room or the room next door. NCH Action for Children suggests that about 750,000 children each year may suffer long-term trauma as a result of exposure to domestic violence. Almost three women in 10 said that their violent partners had also beaten their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not long after my election to the House, I represented a woman in court. However, early in my parliamentary career I realised that representing Bristol, East was enough and I no longer practice at the Bar. That woman was applying for the umpteenth injunction against her husband. Previous injunctions had been granted to her, in the most draconian terms, in recognition of her husband's extreme violence to her and the children. He had done things to her that were quite unimaginable. Like many people in such circumstances, to persuade the judge of her case she had photographs taken of her injuries, which were too awful to describe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That woman came to court with her mother and her three children, one of whom was a boy of five. That child had so often seen his father beat his mother that his behaviour was utterly appalling; I have never seen a child so beyond control. It is not that his mother did not care. The boy had been seen by therapists and child psychologists, but he had grown up seeing that his father had no respect for his mother. Consequently, he, too, had no respect for her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's speech closely. Does she agree that the terrible example that she has so articulately outlined is not unusual? One of the dreadful consequences of the cycle of violence is that it continues into the next generation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her intervention. I agree that we ignore the effect on children at our peril.

Domestic violence has ancient origins. It was not invented by Erin Pizzey when she wrote her book, "Scream quietly or the neighbours will hear", or when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
she and others set up the women's refuge in Chiswick. We have all heard the phrase "rule of thumb", but how many people know that it derives from the ancient law saying that a man could beat his wife as long as he used a stick no thicker than his thumb? It is an ancient tradition—I hesitate to use the word "tradition" because that implies acceptance, but it is a phenomenon that goes back centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The modem impact is that every year more than 60,000 women and children flee to refuges. Domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness among married and unmarried women. The 1976 Select Committee report on violence in marriage recommended that there should be 800 refuges for women and children, but there are still only 300, many of which are underfunded. Part of the impetus for that report came from the former Labour Member of Parliament for Barking, the late Jo Richardson, who was a dear friend to many of us. In 1992–93, the Home Affairs Select Committee examined domestic violence and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green who played no small part in persuading the Committee to embark on that investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute, too, to the Women's Aid Federation of England, which has its headquarters in Bristol and is recognised by everyone, including the Government and local authorities, as having done marvellous work in bringing domestic violence to the public's attention. It has dealt positively with people who suffer domestic violence and has suggested remedies to reduce or eradicate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current law is an utter mess and I am pleased that the Bill addresses the nonsense forced by a woman contemplating taking action under legislation such as the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976, the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates' Courts Act 1978, the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 and by the ability of the court to give an injunction under its jurisdiction. There are different remedies available in different courts depending on whether people are married or unmarried. There will be a wonderful opportunity to debate those issues later in the Bill. The legal process must appreciate the effect of domestic violence, which is another reason why our amendment is important. I am not saying that only women understand all the issues, but with only 6 per cent. of High Court judges being women, it is sometimes difficult to see the shaft of light that can help in understanding other people's circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few years judges have made comments that are almost unbelievable. In 1990, when summing up in a rape trial, Judge Raymond Dodd said:
	<br><q><p>"When women say no they don't always mean no. Men can't turn their emotions on and off like a tap as some women do."</p></q>
In sentencing a man to two years in gaol with 23 months suspended for breaking into a woman's home and attempting to rape her, Judge Gabriel Bruce Hutton said:
	<br><q><p>"I hope you can keep you well-paid job and that the couple of weeks you spend in prison will be treated by your employers as part of your holidays."</p></q>

Before releasing on probation a man who admitted repeated sexual assaults on his 12-year-old stepdaughter, Judge Sir Harold Cassel said:
	<br><q><p>"A pregnant wife's lack of sexual appetite leads to considerable problems for healthy young husbands."</p></q>
So that is all right, then. Such attitudes permeate the legal framework of this country. If we say that domestic violence is relevant only to that part of the Bill which deals with occupation of the family home, because some people are concerned about a breach of the principle that an Englishman's home is his castle, we will miss a wonderful opportunity to say that everything in the Bill and everyone touched by it must be focused on the relevance of domestic violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bar and both branches of the legal profession might be given more respect if they did not treat domestic violence cases as what might be indelicately called the rough trade or as a training for new, young people to find out what life in the legal system is all about. Dealing with domestic violence cases demands a considerable amount of maturity and understanding of human nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to what the hon. Lady has been saying. As someone who has repeatedly campaigned against violence and abuse of children, I know that courts have a problem deciding just how tough to be because it is not always clear who committed violence against children. In an especially bad case involving a friend of mine, after four years the court has finally accepted that the mother, not the father, had committed horrendous acts of violence against the children. There is also a wider problem: survey after survey has shown that children are far more likely to be abused by stepfathers—that is, the mother's new partner—than by their natural father.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, we are talking about generally male violence—a subject to which I shall return. Male violence is a phenomenon not only in domestic relationships but across the board. For example, prisoners are almost uniformly men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the attitude of the Bar, I used to be astonished at the prevalence of young barristers who returned from court having represented a woman victim of domestic violence and said that she was stupid because although she had been knocked around—photographs showed horrendous injuries—she said that she would "go back to him". All kinds of insulting references to such women were made. To think and talk like that is to misunderstand some of the really important things that are happening. First, it is hard to cope with being abused and assaulted by the person who is supposed to love us most. It reduces one's feeling of worth. The man who either tells a woman that he wants to live with her or tells the world that he wants to be with her "till death us do part", spends most of his time knocking her around. That creates a huge feeling of lack of self-worth, with which it is difficult to deal. Secondly, many women are conscious of the importance of marriage and of a stable home for their children. If we ask them what they would like, they say, "I would like us to stay as we are, but I don't want him

to hit me any more." Often women to on for year after year hoping that that might be possible and that the violence will stop, but they finally give in and leave. We should treat such women with respect, not contempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor is the economic relationship between men and women. Many women know that if they leave their husbands or start domestic violence proceedings they are likely to become homeless. Such women may not have the means to provide accommodation for their children and they may not have sufficiently well-paid jobs to enable them to be independent. It is important to recognise that aspect of the power relationship. That is why Polly Toynbee is so wrong. It is not divorce that has been a liberator for this country's women, but economic independence, which has given some women the opportunity to strike out on their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember feeling very bad when I went through my divorce. My father told me that I must not pay too much attention to women of his generation who moralised about what I was doing. He pointed out that when those women said, "I stuck by my Albert through thick and thin", it was because they had no option. My father said, "You now have a job of your own and you can provide for your children. You have an opportunity to take a decision. Nobody should criticise you for taking it having given due thought and consideration to what you should do.". We need a common core of remedies that are available in all courts, and we shall discuss them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of the utmost urgency, we need to consider measures to bring about the eradication of domestic violence, which is something to which the Labour party is committed. Until men accept that they do not have the right to abuse and assault women in the course of their most intimate family relationships, the actions of policy makers will be just so much firefighting. In that context, I have been please to play my role in the campaign to eradicate violence against women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of years ago, during a debate in the House on domestic violence—I have tried to contribute to such debates—my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) referred to a campaign that had been established by Edinburgh district council under the heading "Zero Tolerance". After the debate, I asked my hon. Friend about the campaign and he took the trouble to send me all the material that Edinburgh district council had distributed as part of a public information campaign that was designed to make everyone conscious of the prevalence of domestic violence, the fact that it was no respecter of social class and that it can be perpetrated against women of any age. By the time a woman reaches the age of 18, she has a one in two chance of suffering from some form of sexual abuse. Such important pieces of public information were disseminated by that campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to officers and members of Bristol city council about the possibility of setting up such a campaign in Bristol. We have had a marvellous partnership approach over many years to deal with domestic violence in Bristol. It involves decision makers and policy makers right across the spectrum of law, social services, housing and so on. One of the good things about being Back-Bench Member of Parliament
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
is that it is possible to get involved in such campaigns. They may seem small scale, but they can have a huge impact. At the end of last year, I was delighted to go to the council offices and take part in the launch of Bristol's Zero Tolerance Campaign. I was sent a photograph of the council offices flying a big white flag with a black letter "Z" embroidered on to it. That photograph was sent to me as a memento of that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such public information campaigns will help to us tell present and future generations that what should lie at the heart of any intimate family domestic relationship, whether or not it involves children, is love, natural affection and mutual respect. That mutual respect extends to an acceptance that living with someone—sharing a home, life, finances and all the other obligations—does not entail a right to use one's fist just because it seem convenient. Women's rights are human rights and are equal rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief, but I have several things to say. First, I entirely endorse the hon. Lady's comments on the inappropriateness of our relying so heavily on the legal profession to provide remedies for violence or many other emotional problems. In 1967, in the famous report that led to the removal of judges' sentencing capacity in children's cases in Scotland—where children's hearings have substituted juvenile courts—Lord Kilbrandon said that there was nothing in the training of lawyers that made them more capable than anyone else of reaching the appropriate decision on nurturing and rearing children and young people. The legal profession is trained to ascertain the strengths, weaknesses and truthfulness of a case, which it does probably better than anyone else. That is why in children's hearings, for example, if there is a dispute about the facts the case goes to the sheriff, whereas if there is no dispute about the facts the best outcome for the family is worked out by consultation round the table with people who have been through training that gives them a better chance of arriving at the right answer. One of the difficulties of the Bill—which is about divorce, even though we would like it to be about marriage—is that because it comes from the Lord Chancellor's Department it is bound to be far too narrowly focused within the confines of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the court is faced with the difficulty of deciding whether the children would be, on balance, better off in a home in which there is violence—many women still show extraordinary tolerance and are prepared to put up with violence, in the hope of an emendation later—or whether to be so shocked by the violence that the home is broken up. In such cases—as the hon. Member for Brent, South said—violence is likely to be attracted into the next home that is set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Violence is not only physical. I know that I might sound exactly like one of those judges whom we were discussing earlier—I do not mean to—but there is a skill, be it instinctive, unconscious or deliberate, whereby violence can be elicited through the way in which people behave. Both men and women can develop a great skill at undermining their partners at the very points at which they are most vulnerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Janet Anderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rossendale and Darwen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that it is an excuse of any kind for violence. I am saying that there may well be something in the way in which a man or a woman manages his or her interaction with life that attracts violence, so that a woman who has been in a violent relationship may well move from one violent partner to the next. That certainly seems to be true on the basis of what I hear in my surgeries. I am not saying that those women welcome violence. They absolutely do not. However, I am reluctant to accept that in any relationship the only form of violence is physical violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that some women trawl the world looking for violent men and violent relationships?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Lady misunderstands me. What I am talking about can sometimes be seen in quite young children, who develop a skill at winding someone up until that person hits them. It may be another child. I was a schoolmaster for a while. One can see children using their sarcasm or another skill to wind up someone—perhaps a child who is not particularly articulate or self-confident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Janet Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the hon. Gentleman would describe the kind of behaviour by a child that he feels would justify hitting that child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing that there is any justification for hitting people. That is an absurd proposition. I am suggesting that, whether consciously or unconsciously, instinctively or by design, individuals, whether they are four or forty years old, frequently develop the capacity—and use it—to wind someone up until eventually that person hits them. I am not saying that that response is justified. Violence is not justifiable. However, if Opposition Members do not recognise that phenomenon, they are, I think, deceiving themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in danger of digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole. Violence may exist in many forms, whether it is between children, children and parents, or adults. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not for us as legislators to accept violence in any context as a proper mode of social interaction; and that it is right for us to consider what framework we need to establish to prevent violence from being the norm in any relationship?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that; I do not suggest otherwise. All I am suggesting is that one of the difficulties that the Government, the legal profession and the Committee face concerns whether the appearance of physical violence necessarily creates a reason for destroying a household if the partners within the violent relationship—for whatever reasons—persist in accepting it; and whether, as a result of destroying such a household, the children might be no better off. As my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
(Mrs. Peacock) said, they often move into another household where the new male partner has even less feeling for the children than their natural father had, and is less tolerant and more violent towards them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman concedes that what destroys a household is not the action of the court or that of anyone exercising a function under the Bill, but violent conduct and the person responsible for it. He is slipping into error by ascribing to the court or to the law the consequences of destroying anything. What is destroyed is the basis of trust and mutual support that should form a relationship. That is shattered by the act of violence, however it is perpetrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must move on swiftly—but my point is that, while violence is often a defining moment, it is not the only way in which people destroy one another. For example, a woman can make great play of the sexual impotence of her partner; rather than seek help for it, she loads it on the man. As a result, the man moves further into depression. In a sense, such an act is as violent as hitting someone. It is just a different way to destroy individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is trying to make failures less expensive to the people involved—the children, in particular—and less expensive to the state, which must keep picking up the pieces because people have failed to make their marriages work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman feel that there is a duty on the man to resist being wound up in such circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect enormously the ability to avoid being wound up. I hope and trust that education and a loving family will overlay the natural instincts of people to allow themselves to be wound up with the restraints that make them behave in a non-violent manner. I must say, however, that there are many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of households where that overlay of restraint is extraordinarily difficult to maintain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we are debating the Bill in the context of the Lord Chancellor's responsibility, our debates inevitably focus narrowly. We need to find ways in which we can diminish the growing tendency of our society to turn to violence as a solution to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that we must find ways in which to make society diminish its tendency towards violence. Is not that assisted by taking every opportunity to enshrine in principle an opposition to violence? Does not the hon. Gentleman feel compelled to support at least the principle of the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I await with interest what my hon. Friend the Minister will say about the matter. I have no idea whether the amendment would help or hinder such a process. I am absolutely clear that we wish to diminish violence and, if possible, eradicate it from society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We set about that in a strange way. We fill our households with increasingly violent television and video performances; to an extent that anyone after the 18th century would find astonishing, we make strong drink available to ever-younger people; we glorify what is charmingly called the professional foul on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
football field, and it is only recently that the Football Association has at last decided to intervene to make that slightly less acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree that violence on television and so on has an influence on children in particular, and we want to modify that, but at least one can switch off the television: one cannot switch off a violent man. That is one hell of a difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty with that. I hope that the Committee is not interpreting my remarks as condoning domestic violence or accepting it. It is not my intention to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which we organise education is far from satisfactory for assisting young people to realise that violence is not an appropriate means of resolving disputes. Yesterday I heard on the radio a programme that struck me as extraordinarily promising and interesting. An experiment has been conducted in Derbyshire in which fathers of young children have been encouraged to join a group that looks after the children and takes them on outings, without a woman present. It was extremely encouraging to listen to those former miners and others speaking about the effect that the experience had had on their relationship with their children and their wives, and the understanding that they have gained of, among other things, the amount of work entailed in bringing up young children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A host of strategies must be employed much more effectively to try to diminish the growth of violence in our society. All that the Committee can do is to consider the tail end of an escalation that is doing the country untold harm, which I much regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ms Hodge: I begin with a response to one of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent. People certainly suffer dreadfully from psychological abuse, as well as physical abuse. No member of the Committee would deny that, but it does not make it less important for us to take a clear view of the issue of physical abuse, which is the basis of domestic violence. I would hope that the Committee would see the amendment not merely as unobjectionable, but as critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, domestic violence is more likely than other problems to involve people in the process of divorce. Because it is so dreadful, it must be especially carefully handled. That is a pertinent argument to justify consideration of the matter in the part of the Bill dealing with principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not yet a Member of Parliament when my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green managed to persuade the Home Affairs Committee to examine the issue of domestic violence, but I have read the proceedings. One of the Select Committee's conclusions referred to
	<br><q><p>"a full hearted commitment from the centre of Government to guarantee that most basic of a citizen's rights, the one of living a life where violence is not feared and individual dignity is respected".</p></q>
The amendment attempts to write such a wholehearted commitment into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
