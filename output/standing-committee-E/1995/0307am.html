Standing Committee E</div> <!-- title -->
<time>Thursday 7 March 1996</time>
<p><i>(Morning)</i></p>
<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p><b>Except clauses 36, 105, 112 and 139 and schedule 15)</b></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. May I apologise for not being as clear as required on Tuesday on the difference between domicile and residence as it relates to clause 144? The clause is intended to ensure that the existing tax treatment of free of tax to resident abroad gilts applies to gilts strips. Existing rules exempt from tax on interest all owners of FOTRA gilts who are resident abroad, regardless of their domicile, but do not exempt capital profits on FOTRA gilts unless the owner is resident and domiciled abroad.<br><br>
That approach would create difficulties with stripped gilts because by stripping a gilt the interest payments become coupon strips, which have the character of capital under the FOTRA rules. An interest payment that would, under existing law, be exempt for a non-resident who is not domiciled abroad would cease to be exempt if that interest was stripped.<br><br>
Clause 144 extends the existing treatment of interest to capital payments. FOTRA strips will have the same resident and domiciliary requirements as FOTRA interest has at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order, but I am grateful to the Minister—her statement was very clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien (North Warwickshire)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you thought that it was very clear, Mr. Hogg. Unfortunately, I did not. My hon. F—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I said that the matter was not a point of order. I am not eager to proceed with a debate on the hon. Lady's remarks because our business has moved on. I should be grateful for the hon. Gentleman's co-operation in not pressing the matter. If he has questions about the interpretation of the hon. Lady's comments, he may raise them in a letter to her. I am sure that she would gladly help him in her reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hogg. The hon. Lady had to make a statement because she apparently felt that she had to clarify comments from our previous sitting. Is not it right from the point of view of procedure and good order that the Committee should know whether the Minister stands by everything that she said on Tuesday?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course the hon. Gentleman makes a good point. If I ever require the services of a lawyer, I know to whom I shall turn.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 716</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary of the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Butler <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You could do better than that, Mr. Hogg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, you never know. In any case, we cannot return to the business to which the statement referred. The hon. Lady asked to raise a point of order and clarify a matter, and I agreed because I thought that that would be for the Committee's convenience. If the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) really is serious, he may write to the Minister, otherwise, we should proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) tabled new clause 30, but it has not been selected and has been deemed to be out of order. I know that you are not obliged to explain such matters, but could you do so for the record: The new clause dealt with VAT on energy-saving goods and devices. Will you confirm that it is out of order and clarify why that is so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for contacting me this morning to give notice of his intention to raise that point of order. The new clause is most certainly out of order because it contravenes the first amendment of the law resolution by proposing to vary a rate of value added tax. If it were tabled again in its present form, I am quite certain that Madam Speaker would likewise rule it out of order for precisely the same reason.</span></p>

New Clause 22</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EXEMPTION FROM SECTION 79 IN CERTAIN CASES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) Subject to subsection (5) below, where a creditor relationship of a company is one to which that company is a party in any accounting period in exempt circumstances, any connection for that accounting period between the company and a person who stands in the position of a debtor as respects the debt shall be disregarded for the purposes of section 79 above.</p>
<p>(2) A company having a creditor relationship in any accounting period shall, for that period, be taken for the purposes of this section to be a party to that relationship in exempt circumstances if—
<ol>
<li>the company, in the course of carrying on any activities forming an integral part of a trade carried on by that company in that period, disposes of or acquires assets representing creditor relationships;</li>
<li>that period is one for which the company uses an authorised mark to market basis of accounting as respects all the creditor relationships represented by assets acquired in the course of those activities;</li>
<li>the asset representing the creditor relationship in question was acquired in the course of those activities;</li>
<li>that asset is either—</li>
<ol>
<li>listed on a recognised stock exchange at the end of that period; or</li>
<li>a security the redemption of which must occur within twelve months of its issue;</li></ol>
<li>there is a time in that period when assets of the same kind as the asset representing the loan relationship in question are in the beneficial ownership of persons other than the company; and</li>
<li>there is not more than three months, in aggregate, in that accounting period during which the equivalent of 30 per cent.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 717</span>
or more of the assets of that kind is in the beneficial ownership of connected persons.</li></ol></p>
<p>(3) An insurance company carrying on basic life assurance and general annuity business and having a creditor relationship in any accounting period shall, for that period, be taken for the purposes of this section to be a party to that relationship in exempt circumstances if—
<ol>
<li>assets of the company representing any of its creditor relationships are linked for that period to its basic life assurance and general annuity business;</li>
<li>that period is one for which the company uses an authorised mark to market basis of accounting as respects all the creditor relationships of the company represented by assets that are so linked;</li>
<li>the asset representing the creditor relationship in question is so linked;</li>
<li>that asset is either—</li>
<ol>
<li>listed on a recognised stock exchange at the end of that period; or</li>
<li>a security the redemption of which must occur within twelve months of its issue;</li></ol>
<li>there is a time in that period when assets of the same kind as the asset representing the creditor relationship in question are in the beneficial ownership of persons other than the company; and</li>
<li>there is not more than three months, in aggregate, in that period during which the equivalent of 30 per cent. or more of the assets of that kind is in the beneficial ownership of connected persons.</li></ol></p>
<p>(4) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) above—
<ol>
<li>assets shall be taken to be of the same kind where they are treated as being of the same kind by the practice of any recognised stock exchange, or would be so treated if dealt with on such a stock exchange; and</li>
<li>a connected person has the beneficial ownership of an asset wherever there is, or (apart from this section) would be, a connection (within the meaning of section 79 above) between—</li>
<ol>
<li>the person who has the beneficial ownership of the asset, and</li>
<li>a person who stands in the position of a debtor as respects the money debt by reference to which any loan relationship represented by that asset subsists.</li></ol></ol></p>
<p>(5) Where for any accounting period—
<ol>
<li>subsection (1) above has effect in the case of a creditor relationship of a company, and</li>
<li>the person who stands in the position of a debtor as respects the debt in question is also a company,</li></ol>
that subsection shall not apply for determining, for the purposes of so much of section 79 above as relates to the corresponding debtor relationship, whether there is a connection between the two companies.</p>
<p>(6) Subsection (4) of section 79 above shall apply for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of that section.</p>
<p>(7) In this section "basic life assurance and general annuity business" and "insurance company" have the same meanings as in Chapter I of Part XII of the Taxes Act 1988, and section 432ZA of that Act (linked assets) shall apply for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of that Chapter.'.—[<i>Mrs. Angela Knight</i>].</p>

<p>(3) Where, to enable Q to make the transfer to P or his nominee which is mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) above, Q enters into an arrangement under which—

New Clause 24</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
OLD VEHICLES: FURTHER PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>`(1) In Schedule 2 to the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 (exempt vehicles), for paragraph 1A (inserted by section 16 above) there shall be substituted the following paragraph—</p>
<p><i>"Old vehicles"</i></p>
<p>1A.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), a vehicle is an exempt vehicle at any time if it was constructed more than 25 years before the beginning of the year in which that time falls.</p>
<p>(2)A vehicle is not an exempt vehicle by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) if—
<ol>
<li>an annual rate is specified in respect of it by any provision of Part III, V, VI, VII or VIII of Schedule 1; or</li>
<li>it is a special vehicle, within the meaning of Part IV of Schedule 1, which—</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>falls within sub-paragraph (3) or (4); and</li>
<li>is not a digging machine, mobile crane, works truck or road roller.</li></ol></p>
<p>(3) A vehicle falls within this sub-paragraph if—
<ol>
<li>it is designed or adapted for use for the conveyance of goods or burdens of any description;</li>
<li>it is put to a commercial use on a public road; and</li>
<li>that use is not a use for the conveyance of goods or burden of any description.</li></ol></p>
<p>(4) A vehicle falls within this sub-paragraph if—
<ol>
<li>it is designed or adapted for use with a semi-trailer attached;</li>
<li>it is put to a commercial use on a public road; and</li>
<li>in a case where that use is a use with a semi-trailer attached, the semi-trailer is not used for the conveyance of goods or burden of any description.</li></ol></p>
<p>(5) In sub-paragraph (2) "digging machine", "mobile crane" and "works truck" have the same meanings as in paragraph 4 of Schedule 1.</p>
<p>(6) In sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) "commercial use" means use for hire or reward or for or in connection with a trade or business."</p>
<p>(2) This section has effect in relation to times on or after 1st June 1996.'.—[<i>Mr. Heatheoat Amory.</i></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following: Amendment (a), in line 6, leave out '25' and insert `35'</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I explain that the new clause will extend the vehicle excise duty exemption for 25 year-old vehicles to preserve vehicles such as fire engines, road rollers, steam traction engines, agricultural, ex-military and ex-commercial vehicles from 1 June? It will not apply to commercially operated buses, coaches, heavy goods vehicles or recover vehicles.<br><br>
As the Committee will recall, my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor exempted from vehicle exise duty cars, motor cycles and tricycles older than 25 year in his Budget. Owners of about 150,000 vehicles have already received refunds of duty as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not catch how many vehicles had already received refunds. I was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
trying to listen, but I am not sure whether the Paymaster General mentioned the figure. If he did not, could he tell me how many vehicles will receive the refund and how much that will cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: About 150,000 vehicles were affected and most have already received their duty refunds as a result. I shall provide the hon. Lady with the sum that those refunds cost us in a moment.<br><br>
The new clause extends similar treatment to other important classes of vehicles preserved for their mechanical and historical interest. On 1 February, I announced in Committee that we intended to introduce the new clause. That announcement was warmly received, not just in Committee, but more widely by the vehicle preservation movement. It welcomed our acceptance of its argument that such vehicles are an equally important part of our motoring heritage. Vehicles exempted under the provisions of the new clause will, nevertheless, remain subject to the requirements to licence annually, to display a tax disc and to produce an MOT and insurance certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister about the effect the new clause will have on the ability to continue to use quite dangerous older vehicles which are used for commercial purposes. If the worst comes to the worst, could the new clause provide an incentive for older, commercial vehicles that have been identified by a new organisation called Brake, which has a huge number of members from both sides of the House? It has raised this issue with the Minister for Transport in London, the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris), who has responded sympathetically. Older commercial vehicles may be a danger to residents and pedestrians because of faulty brakes and so forth. I am concerned that the new clause will make that danger on our roads, especially in hilly urban areas, that much greater.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I seek clarification from the Minister on the number of vehicles that will be affected by the new clause? He suggested that vehicles used commercially would not be exempt. How will that work?<br><br>
Government procedures now require that each Department should have a "green" Minister, who vets the policies proposed by the Department and reports regularly on their impact on the environment. Who is the designated Minister for the Treasury, what is his view of this proposal and what discussions has he had on it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just thought that I should say a quick word in support of the new clause as refined by my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General. I welcome what he is seeking to do, and I am strongly opposed to the Labour amendment (a), for the reasons that I set out—I need not weary the Committee by repeating myself—in my excellent speech on 1 February.<br><br>
I should declare a retrospective interest. Alas, the wonderful Morris Minor that I used to drive, which was made in 1966, has gone to a happier home.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 721</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not in the sky. It has gone to a good home with someone else. I trust the new owners to cherish and look after it as we did.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) is the inspiration behind the amendment to the new clause. The Government seek to provide an exemption from vehicle excise duty. The effect of her amendment would be to exclude from that exemption a number of excellent classic cars that are likely to stand the test of time by anyone's reckoning. I listed some of them in my speech on 1 February at column 78, so I shall not repeat myself.<br><br>
People in my constituency and throughout the country with a passion for class cars have made it clear to me that they are appreciative of the Government's proposal and they believe that some of the classics of the '60s that should be exempted under the new clause would be excluded from its provisions if the hon. Lady's amendment were passed. You, Mr. Hogg, probably remember such cars: splendid, rounded cars with nice features and big eyes, like the Morris Minor and other classics, such as the Alvis TD 21 and some of the Jaguars. Indeed, the latest Jaguar, which has just been unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is a conscious derivative of the rounded lines and pleasing aspects of the E-type of those days. So there are many good reasons, both aesthetic and nostalgic, for supporting the new clause.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely pleased to follow the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman). I have in my hand his speech of 1 February. I do not know whether it is a classic that will stand the test of 25 or 35 years, but the hon. Gentleman openly admitted his passion for the subject. The more he spoke, the more gripped I became. The rounded lines, the big eyes—clearly, it is a sexy subject for the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Many people are gripped by old and classic cars, but why is 25 years the classic date? Why not 30, or 35 years? The figure appears to have been plucked out of the air, but perhaps the Minister will explain why that date has been chosen. The Committee has been told that 150,000 vehicles will be affected, but will the Minister say whether the new clause will add to that figure?<br><br>
I am not gripped by the passion for old cars. My passion is for a green and clean environment. I want the landscape to be protected and the environment enhanced. I wonder whether the passion for cars, and now for lorries, works against my passion for the environment. Cars have become more efficient, cleaner and greener as technology has advanced, but more can be done. I despair at a policy that allows old cars, and now lorries, back on the road and puts them in an advantageous tax position.<br><br>
There is a real possibility that some—not all, but some—of those vehicles will be bad polluters and a safety hazard. The record of accidents caused by old commercial vehicles is long. I am anxious about the new clause. I hope that the Minister will think again, that he will tell the Committee how many extra vehicles come under its provisions, and how much it will cost.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should tell my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) that in 1972 I had a job driving a Thames Trader truck that even then was unsafe and a heavy polluter. I am sure that that clapped-out old vehicle is still around.<br><br>
I have read through the new clause several times, but am still unsure of the status of steam-powered vehicles, and in particular of road rollers. Are road rollers excluded from the new clause? A constituent of mine collects vintage road rollers. Opposition Members may be worried about the net being spread too wide, so that vehicles that are not truly classic will be exempted, but will the tidying-up operation that the Government are carrying out by means of the new clause treat all collectors of all classic vehicles in the same way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause refers specifically to heavy goods vehicles. The provision for classic cars appeared elsewhere in the Bill. I will not go back over the arguments as to why we believe—despite the pleading tones of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington—that the age for classic car designation should be 35 years and not 25 years, as the Government have decided. We are not against recognising the importance of classic, older vehicles. As the Minister said, they are of mechanical and historical interest. However, no justification has been made, in the Committee or anywhere else, for the defining age to be 25 years.<br><br>
I have attended the west country steam vehicles rally, which is held in the constituency of the Paymaster General, so I can well understand why very old, magnificent vehicles should be exempt from vehicle excise duty. I can see too, why people would not want to drive them on our roads under any circumstances, except to get them to such fairs. The fact remains, however, that the Paymaster General has not told us how many HGVs will qualify under the provision, how much it will cost the Exchequer and which unique, distinguishing features of 25-year-old vehicles make them of mechanical and historical interest. If he could define the difference between a classic vehicle and an old banger, we would be happy; but there are many. When the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington spoke about the new Jaguars, he described them as classics—I am sure that they are, but they are not 25 years old and the definition of classic is not, therefore, age-based.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady misunderstood my point. I was attempting to demonstrate that the brilliance of the original E-type's design—that was my example—was so lasting and has been so recognised that it is now reflected in the design of the latest Jaguar sports car, which has just been presented at the Geneva motor show.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So we have been told of a classic design that is not 25 years old—"classic" is obviously more flexible than relating merely to age. That was my point.<br><br>
We want answers to our questions; the measure involves a considerable amount of money, which could be better spent elsewhere for the sake of a 10-year extension, making 35 years the qualifying date. In the absence of any explanation from the Paymaster General, we will make our views known at the relevant time.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cycle regularly to Parliament and sometimes wonder whether I will arrive. I often find myself behind precisely those cars and lorries that the polluter's friends on the Conservative Benches want to protect and encourage. Whether or not I wear a mask, I choke behind those old crocks.<br><br>
As I listen to this short debate and remember the Committee's earlier discussions, I condemn to perdition the Ministers and civil servants who dreamt up this ridiculous new tax relief, which will make all our roads filthier, more smog-ridden and poisonous for the children and cyclists on them. (Hon. Members: "Spoilsport."] I hear cries of "Spoilsport" from Tory Members. It is interesting that the measure was proposed only after the Financial Secretary who graced the Financial Committee last year was promoted to Secretary of State for Transport. The Treasury would not have dared to bring in such a filthy, anti-cyclist tax until the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young was sacked. He is a cyclist and knows full well what it is like to ride through London reading the letters at the end of number plates—already indicative of the last cycle of A to Z—and to get stuck behind lorries and buses that constantly pollute our city air with filth.<br><br>
I regret that amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) on landfill tax have not been selected, for that is another tax that will leave far more of our countryside—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is stretching things when the hon. Gentleman speaks in support of amendments that have not been selected and therefore have not been moved by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. I know that the hon. Gentleman went to the same school as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, but this is carrying loyalties too far. The hon. Gentleman is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for the correction, Mr. Hogg, and I promise not to revert to French which is the preferred language in which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has his exchanges with me.<br><br>
My serious point is that other countries are encouraging the purchase of more environmentally friendly cars with scrap-and-build policies, while we are going in the opposite direction by encouraging the filthiest polluting vehicles to stay on our roads as long as possible. That policy is deplorable and it emanates from a Government who have not the slightest interest in securing cleaner air for the lungs of our young children. The provision is anti-bicycle and it will be deeply resented by cyclists all over the country. It is a measure for old crocks from a Government of old crocks. The sooner they go, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington for his support. His is the voice of the true enthusiast—someone who truly understands the importance of Britain's motoring and industrial heritage. He put the case better than I can for his modest help to such an important part of our national heritage.<br><br>
I contrast what my hon. Friend said with the misery speeches from the hon. Members for Sherwood and for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), who obviously have no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
feel or instinct for this aspect of national life and the good work carried out by thousands of enthusiasts all over the country to keep vehicles in good repair. The hon. Members sole criticism of the proposal was on environmental grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has suggested that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is concerned about the motor industry's heritage. Let me assure him that many of my constituents work in the motor industry and that Labour Members are deeply concerned about its future. It could have a great future if we kept old crocks off the road and started replacing them with good cars made by people currently working in a prosperous motor industry. That is what we are concerned about—not the past, but the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. The motor industry has enjoyed a revival under the Government. I used to be a motorbike enthusiast when I was about 16 and remember watching the British industry being annihilated by overseas competition under a Labour Government. We have turned round the prospects—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way again because I must respond to the debate.<br><br>
I am sure that we are not looking after only our heritage, but the future of the British motor industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like my right hon. Friend to consider the proposed paragraph 1A(2)(b)(ii) in the new clause, which deals with exclusions. It refers to a category of vehicle which
<br><blockquote><p>"is not a digging machine, mobile crane, works truck or road roller".</p></blockquote>
I want to ask him to consider another category that has not been included but should be—a prima roller [<i>Laughter.</i>] It is powered by hot air, has a long stroke and is a big bore vehicle with twin or triple carburettors. I believe that it also has an original chassis but I have not been able to confirm that.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have discovered some new crocks in the course of our proceedings and we are amazed that some of them are still on the road. I shall examine my hon. Friend's point, but perhaps in a future Finance Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hillsborough raised the issue of the new clause's effect on the environment. She was worried that dangerous vehicles could be kept on the road. Generally, however, very few vehicles—either cars or larger vehicles—ever reach the age of 14. Only some 2 per cent. do so and only half of that number ever make it to 25 years, so we are not talking about large numbers of vehicles being kept artificially on the road.<br><br>
Moreover, as I said earlier, all vehicles will still have to pass MOT tests and comply with emission limits. They will still have to be insured and many insurance companies can impose a mileage limit. The cost of maintaining vehicles and securing insurance almost
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0628">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
invariably outweights any saving that we are advancing through exemption from vehicle excise duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister is aware of the extreme concern about the number of trucks operating for goods purposes on our roads. According to research, around 5 per cent. of trucks are unlicensed and they constitute a hazard. The Secretary of State for Transport is keen, together with the all-party group, Brake, to undertake a seizure programme to get dangerous trucks of the road. Can the Minister be sure that some of those 5 per cent. operating without licences are not over 25 years old? I guess that some of them are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is referring to commercial vehicles that are operated in defiance of licensing requirements. However, I have already made it clear that the concession does not apply to commercial vehicles so her intervention is irrelevant. If the hon. Lady is worried about the enforcement of road standards she should pursue her concern with the Department of Transport but it is not a matter for this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple question. Will cars exempted under the proposal carry any disc on their windscreen? If not, will they not be hit by the insurance crackdown announced in the House some weeks ago, according to which any car failing to carry a disc will be clamped immediately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will carry a tax disc.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) got into something of a muddle in our previous debate when he talked about a friend who had two "lovingly restored" Ford Cortinas. He then voted for a provision that would again have made them liable to vehicle excise duty.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the number of vehicles affected by the exemption. I have already said that my right hon. and learned Friends's original Budget announcement took 150,000 cars out of vehicle excise duty at a first-year cost of £15 million. The new clause will add about 16,000 vehicles, at a cost of £1 million.<br><br>
The vehicles that will be affected are as varied as our motoring heritage. They will include fire engines, road rollers, steam traction engines, agricultural tractors, and all ex-military and ex-commercial vehicles. That is why the announcement was welcomed by the clubs and associations that represent enthusiasts. Commercial vehicles will, however, not be included.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East asked who is the Treasury's environment Minister, and it is me. I am, therefore, pleased to table a new clause that will do nothing to damage the environment and will help many thousands of enthusiasts—including some of my constituents, who have written to thank me for tabling the new clause. Despite the Opposition's whingeing and whining about mythical environmental damage, we have received thankful and grateful letters from fine organisations, such as the Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs, the Historic Commercial Vehicle Society and the Vintage Fire Engine Society. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
cannot imagine British organisations that do a better job and more deserve the modest support that the Budget offers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it is good taxation policy to design measures so that one receives letters of thanks. That is a strange principle. Will the Government pursue it in future Bedgets and Finance Bills?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are quite certain that the new clause's effects and costs are fully in line with all our social and budgetary objectives.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) asked about steam-rollers, which will be made exempt under the new clause. The Opposition amendment, to which we shall come in a minute, might, however, make some vehicles once more liable for tax. I ask the Committee, therefore, to vote with enthusiasm for the new clause, which is welcome outside the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There we have it. The Minister has responsibility for environmental issues, but thinks that the problems are totally mythical. If anyone doubts that the Government are seriously concerned about the environment, that observation encapsulates all that he needs to know.<br><br>
The Minister gave no particular reason for the defining date of 25 years, although he answered my other questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman on that point, too. We have asked motor museums and historic car clubs about whether vehicles made before 1970 are classic cars. They have confirmed that they are. I have a full classification dividing all historic vehicles between veteran cars, vintage cars and classic cars. The vehicles we are seeking to exempt fall squarely into the definition of a classic car.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Minister another reason for setting the date at 25 years. The document "Transport: The Way Ahead" asks:
<br><blockquote><p>"Are we prepared to introduce significantly tougher measures to improve environmental performance of individual vehicles, even if that raises their prices or reduces their performance in other ways?"</p></blockquote>
The answer is as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"A 1995 petrol-engined car fitted with a catalytic converter is 90 per cent. less polluting than one made in 1970. This illustrates the dramatic improvements in emission standards that has been achieved by the industry over 25 years."</p></blockquote>
That is an answer to the great transport debate initiated by the former Secretary of State for Transport, the present Minister without Portfolio, the right hon. Member for Peterborough (Dr. Mawhinney).<br><br>
The Paymaster General posed a question that was answered not by an environmental organisation or the type of body that the Minister would like to suggest peddles myths on subjects such as this, but by the Automobile Association, which clearly recognises the massive progress of the past 25 years. The association goes on to suggest fiscal measures to encourage the further development of clean-vehicle technology, and it specifically defines 25 years as the period over which the gains have been made.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
The Minister considers the problem of the environment to be a myth. His opening remarks were very short, for good reason, as he was a little vague about the breakdown of the vehicles involved. Of the 16,000 vehicles mentioned, 11,800 will be heavy goods lorries—that is the number of such lorries on the road that are more than 25 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information. About 1,000 of the vehicles will be lorries. Some of them will be of genuine historic and industrial interest, as the hon. Gentleman, with his background in the industry, really should know.<br><br>
There will also be 4,500 fire engines, ex-military vehicles, road rollers, steam engines and agricultural vehicles, including tractors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister is saying that 16,000 vehicles will be covered by the new clause. There are 11,800 heavy goods lorries over the age of 25 years on the road, and the Minister suggests that only 1,000 will benefit from the provision. If those are the genuine figures that the Minister is working from, his only option effectively will be to prevent the application of the new clause to any vehicle being used for commercial purposes.<br><br>
The Minister has not told the Committee how he intends to police the new clause. Frankly, I do not see how it can be done. I do not believe that he will be able to do so. I believe that the end result will be that up to 11,800 heavy goods vehicles over 25 years old will be given a tax incentive to continue being driven around.<br><br>
Has the Minister looked into that problem? He has failed to explain how the new clause will work. We know that a variety of enforcement measures exist that are not being policed and implemented properly. The new clause is another example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend also note that the Minister did not answer the question that I asked on behalf of cyclists? I wonder what consultations were held with cyclists groups. The all-party parliamentary group on cycling may hear about this appalling measure too late to influence its inclusion in the Bill, but I am sure that there will be a strong reaction to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that in a minute.<br><br>
This new clause is the direct result of the previous exemption granted for classic cars. The Minister cannot leave the anomaly, so to justify the previous tax exemption, he is prepared to bring in legislation that could give thousands of polluting vehicles vehicles a discal incentive to continue to behave in that way. There is no doubt that that is the situation.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The Minister said that I got into a muddle when I talked about the previous proposal. I assure him that I did not. I am fully aware of the consequences of the Minister's previous proposal; our amendment to it would have changed the defining age from 25 years to 35 years. I am aware that as a result of that, some people would suffer a tax that they would not have had otherwise.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
The Minister tells us that he has had lots of letters in support of his proposal and uses that as an indication of how valuable it is. For all the targeted press releases from Conservative central office naming me as the Labour Front-Bench spokesman on the issue—which, by the way, I am not—I have had exactly one letter of objection. It was from a gentleman who is the secretary of the Maxi owners club. He says that he is appalled by my opposition to the Government's generous treatment of him and his members, but he goes on to give only one reason in the whole letter as to why the Minister's idea is such a good one: because he is a pensioner in poor circumstances. I can sympathise with him on that.<br><br>
Paying vehicle excise duty is arduous for a pensioner in poor circumstances. It is arduous for some pensioners in my constituency, too, but they will continue to pay for those roads that other people have been exempted from paying for. They will also pay the tax that falls on motorists. Motorists do not pay charges for roads alone—under the current road tax system, they pay a substantial amount over and above those charges. They will continue to pay, while people who drive around in cars—and now lorries—that are more than 25 years old will not.<br><br>
All the representations from the industry at the time of the royal commission—whose findings included some quite draconian proposals to clean up the air in our cities—pointed to the massive improvement that had already been made in vehicle technology. In response to the royal commission, the industry drew particular attention to the problem of diesels and fumes that come from HGVs, lorries and buses and it tried to say that such draconian measures were not necessary because of the massive improvements that had been achieved in the past 25 years. Now the Government, in the person of the Minister with environmental responsibilities himself, are providing a fiscal incentive for people to keep old, dirty, environmentally unfriendly, health-damaging vehicles on the road. That sums up the joke that is the Government's environmental compliance.<br><br>
Conservative Members try to portray themselves as genuine enthusiasts. I have worked in the car industry for most of my life and I consider myself an enthusiast, not only for the industry's products and the people who drive them, but for the people who have worked in and built that industry over a long period. When I saw the pictures of the new Jaguar—I was fortunate enought to have a preview as well—I was proud that it was designed and engineered in Coventry, and will be built there. Anybody can see the traditions in the styling and engineering from the E-type Jaguar and the XJ series before that. But what on earth has that got to do with the new clause? If the Minister genuinely wanted to protect motor enthusiasts who are keen to look after such cars merely from a heritage viewpoint, he could find many other ways of doing so. People use such cars every day in the same way as other people use theirs. In the main—not entirely—the people who drive vehicles that are more than 25 years old are more affluent, so why should they have this tax break? There is no justification for it.<br><br>
I do not cycle in London, but I try to cycle at the weekend in an attempt to keep my weight down. Unlike
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0630">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 729</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham, I do not dare to cycle in London. London is a dangerous and extremely unfriendly place for cyclists. more should be done and could be done to make it a better place for pedestrians and cyclists. We would improve the economy of our capital if we did so, because one of the blights on the capital is the massive problem caused by the over-use of petrol-driven vehicles around London. Money could be well spent on making improvements.<br><br>
Instead of that, the Minister is giving a tax break to his hon. Friends. Conservative Members tell us that everyone who owns a classic car owns at least five of them. There is no justification for the new clause. The amendment—which wold extend the age of an exempt vehicle to 35 years—would result in only those older vehicles that are used by genuine enthusiasts being exempt and would not give this ridiculous incentive to people with old, polluting vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Government could have found other ways of helping classic car owners. The Labour party has not done so: all it has done is to oppose the help that we are providing. If he is anxious to help the owners of the lovingly restored Mark II Cortinas to which he referred, he should have tabled a more constructive amendment rather than one that seeks to penalise those owners.<br><br>
The central point that the hon. Gentleman has not fully taken on board is that we are dealing with a very small part of the total vehicle fleet. The massive improvements that have been made to the emission standards of modern vehicles are helping to clean up the environment. They completely dwarf any effect of the new clause. Only a small number of cars reach 25 years of age. Any small additional incentive has a tiny environmental effect, even taking account of the fact that the purchase of new vehicles and the replacement of old ones has a beneficial effect on the environment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East sometimes refers to the classic car owners as rich owners and sometimes he talks as though they are simply preserving old bangers. The aim of the new clause is to help enthusiasts who are keeping in working order such vehicles as old fire engines. Those of us who are a little older can just remember the old fire engines with the brass pump on the front. Enthusiasts try to keep them road worthy, not for roaring around and polluting the environment, but for shows and rallies from time to time. The costs of maintenance and achieving MOT standards completely outweigh any small fiscal advantage that they will get from the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us how he intends to ensure that the 11,800 heavy goods lorries that are older than 25 years and that operate now will not benefit from the proposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because they are already identified. Instead of the 11,000 vehicles instanced by the hon. Gentleman, we know from existing records that there are about 1,000 such lorries registered in the "Private/HGV" class. We have already identified vehicles to which the new concession and exemption will apply—there are about 1,000 of them. There is no question of our having to run round to try to identify a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
new group of vehicles because one exists already on the register. We are providing such vehicles with a modest exemption. I hope that that explanation disposes with one of the hon. Gentleman's canards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because I anticipate the hon. Lady's intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You cannot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, perhaps not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there are 11,000 heavy goods vehicles older than 25 years and 1,000 have been identified as private and therefore not commercial, how will the Minister prevent the other 10,000 unscrupulous owners from changing the definition of what they use as a heavy goods vehicle in order to take advantage of the tax break?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must know that commercial heavy goods vehicles are taxed up to £5,000 a year. A procedure exists and works to identify and tax heavy goods vehicles for commercial use, whatever their age. The problem mentioned by the hon. Lady does not exist in practice.<br><br>
All vehicles to be used on the roads will have to comply with MOT standards set by Parliament and there is no question of our putting on to the roads thousands of new vehicles without any controls. It is entirely fair that Parliament lays down standards and that, if a vehicle complies with those, it is free to use the roads.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to intervene briefly because I voted with the Government on the earlier clause without having intervened. If there is a Division on this new clause, I want at least to put on record why I shall vote with the Government again.<br><br>
The Labour party made some powerful and valid environmental arguments with which I have a substantial amount of agreement. However, I am not convinced that such arguments justify the amendment, which uses a big sledge hammer to crack a small nut. I have no particular special interest although were my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir David Steel) in the Room, I am sure that he would regale the Committee at great length on the wonders of classic cars.<br><br>
As a constituency Member, I can testify that I received significant representations from people who keep more than one classic car. They were not rich by any means, but they had a special interest and were concerned about the costs involved.<br><br>
The Alford transport museum is in my constituency, but it will receive only modest benefit from the new clause. The museum acts as a focus of interest for the entire area. Many vehicles come into the museum on loan, are restored by the museum and sometimes vehicles leave it. It is not a static museum in the sense that its exhibits are not static—by definition the museum is static. The exhibits come and go, they are on

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
loan, they pass through and there is a terrific dynamism which creates much interest and enthusiasm. The museum exhibits at shows all over the north-east of Scotland and the Government's proposal represents a modest contribution to recognising that such activity is desirable but that a cost is attached. The concession is a relatively small contribution to the real cost of keeping such vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman also agree that Opposition Members' remarks about the allegedly deplorable environmental practices and consequences of the measure are wrong when it comes to the owners and users of classic cars? Above all other people, they are proud to keep their cars in the finest fettle.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly true. If I have a special interest, it is a negative one. I can confirm, from my own experience, what the Minister said about the ability of some cars to last until they become classic cars. I have been nursing my mother's 12-year old Astra as my London runabout but it is currently lying dead on the forecourt, having suffered a complete cooling system breakdown on my way in this morning. It is clear that that car has not the slightest chance of becoming a classic. It is struggling in its 12th year and 25 years seem beyond its aspirations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike its driver.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The driver has ambitions to be classic for the rest of his days.<br><br>
This is a valid debate but the Government's proposals are sensible and practical. The Labour party used many good arguments, but they are not relevant to defeating the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to explore with the Minister the logical principles upon which the measure is based. The principle of taxation is that it should treat everyone fairly, The Minister is bringing in a measure that will assist owners and collectors of classic cars, but is not extending a similar tax benefit to collectors of classic railway vehicles. One effect of privatisation is that it is now almost impossible to take a preserved steam locomotive on Railtrack's tracks because of the track leasing charges. A large amount of money—hundreds of millions of pounds, when one includes classic cars as well as classic commercial vehicles—is being forgone to benefit one set of collectors and preservers of this country's industrial heritage, while nothing is being done for other people who are doing a similar job in a different sector of transport. Would the Minister tell us why collectors and preservers of motor heritage are getting a benefit when others are not?<br><br>
I also ask him—and this is not a flippant point—to reflect on the parallel that a pensioner drew for me a few days ago. The Government think that old motor vehicles are important and worthy of reverence and respect, but do not the generation of people who fought Hitler in the war and who have paid tax through a 40- or 50-year working life also deserve respect? Unlike vehicles, pensioners get no tax exemption on the basis of age and endurance. The Minister may say that that is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
a ridiculous parallel, but to that pensioner, and I suspect to many others, it does not seem ridiculous.<br><br>
I suspect that the Minister will say that the principle of exempting pensioners from taxation would be difficult because while some pensioners are on low incomes and would benefit enormously from an exemption, others are wealthy—but one can say exactly the same about classic car owners. Some do not have large incomes and the exemption for vehicle excise duty will make a difference to them, but others are wealthy and well-heeled and do not need a tax break to engage in their hobby. So that argument is not valid. What will appear in the Conservative party election speech handbook as the stock answer to the pensioner's question, which I suspect many will ask Tory candidates during the general election: "Why does your Government give tax breaks to old cars, but not to older citizens who have served the country well and fought for it during a war?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not planned to preface my remarks on the debate, but listening to the Opposition Members, I feel that they simply do not understand real people. They are not in touch with the real population. I regularly visit Dover transport museum and meet people who are interested in and collect vehicles. Many elderly people or even unemployed people who have managed to save money over the years and are not seeking another job are among those who find old vehicles an enjoyable and creative pastime. It sometimes becomes work in itself for them. The Dover transport museum may be able to employ one or two people to help with its operations.<br><br>
People loan their heavy goods vehicles or motor cars to the museum, which brings enormous benefit to our local community in Dover and Deal. I want to ensure that such people gain a little tax benefit. The vehicles are not always left in the museum. Sometimes they have to be driven around for repairs or to demonstrate the benefits that the museum can provide to families in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny any of that. The hon. Gentleman puts his case eloquently, but he has not responded to the question why tax benefit should be available to one set of collectors—of classic road vehicles—but not to another set—of classic rail vehicles. Rail vehicles need expensive repairs and rail track access costs have to be paid. If the argument is good for the goose, why is it not good for the gander?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must answer the question why some of his colleagues are against the principle of classic cars having tax relief. My point is that the benefit affects not just the owner of the vehicle, but those who enjoy looking at classic vehicles and who attend museums and experience the pleasure of being there. If the hon. Gentleman and his party want to extend the exemption to other public sector vehicles and other collectors' items, I am sure that we could consider doing that. I am sure that the Government will be sympathetic. We are proposing tax incentives for people who take part in creating museums about our national heritage. The money involved is minuscule but the provision is significant in creating enjoyment for many young, middle aged and old people in this coun-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
try. Many people would agree that it is worthwhile for the Government to provide such a tax incentive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about a constituent who lovingly cares for the vehicles. How will his constituent still paying the full vehicle excise duty, perhaps a pensioner in poor circumstances, feel about having to continue paying it while others are driving around using such vehicles as normal road vehicles and paying nothing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not got the point. Some people have put classic vehicles into the museum for the benefit of the community of Dover and Deal. Some of the vehicles will end up being owned by the museum over time, but presently most of the vehicles are the property of individuals who are providing enormous enjoyment for many people. My son, for example, enjoys himself enormously by going to the museum and seeing old buses and heavy goods vehicles. Sometimes he can even go on to the vehicles and see them at close range.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. gentleman not aware that vehicles in a museum do not necessarily have to pay road tax? In some circumstances trade plates can be applied for that allow vehicles to be moved around without paying the full vehicle excise duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should remember the expression "When in a hole, do not dig yourself deeper". Many vehicles are loaned to museums. Sometimes a trip to a fete or function is made solely to advertise the museum. One of the fire engines from the Dover transport museum appeared at a village fete in my constituency to advertise the museum's existence.<br><br>
Before the Bill's proposed changes to the tax legislation, the existing arrangements meant that taking such vehicles on the road involved going through all the motions of obtaining a duty disc, at enormous expense. The new clause means that people will be able to loan vehicles to bodies such as the Dover transport museum without having to pay tax as soon as they are returned. That will be a tremendous benefit. The new clause means that hundreds of thousands more people will regard museums as a leisure facility where they can enjoy looking at classic vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to make a brief contribution, but I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has described part of our leisure industry that seems to work well at the moment. None of the excellent transport museums in the Yorkshire area have complained to me that they will survive only if the new clause's tax relief is implemented.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman began with a point about general taxation philosophy. In my constituency the Rotherham college of arts and technology is about to sack some 100 people because it is £1 million in debt. The students and lecturers who will be without courses and jobs will find it a very odd—but perhaps not surpris-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
ing—choice of priorities that the Government can find £150 million to help the relatively well-off people who own classic vehicles. That they are well off is borne out by the correspondence from the associations devoted to historic and classic cars, among others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really must invite members of the Labour party to meet some real people. Labour Members are out of touch with what is going on. The people who collect such vehicles are not multi-millionaires, although the owners of the really rare Porsches and Bugattis probably are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. Butler) has one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that my hon. Friend has sold his vehicle. Many of the owners of such vehicles have modest means and assets. I have met them in my constituency on a number of occasions. Some of them have retired early, often as a result a change in the company for which they worked. Their incomes are relatively modest.<br><br>
Collecting classic cars is a leisure activity that involves some knowledge and skill. It might also provide some additional income, but the main purpose is to occupy people's time. The cars bring enormous pleasure to many, and that is why I support the new clause. The Government's feet are firmly on the ground. They understand the needs of real people, and the Labour party is totally out of touch with the people who own the vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for York asked about trains and rolling stock of a heritage nature. Such vehicles fall well outside the scope of the new clause and of the Bill. In any case, they are not subject to excise duty. Incidentally, it is always dangerous to draw such facts to the Treasury's notice, but in this case we are not tempted. However, there is nothing that I can do to relieve them of a tax that we do not levy.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman drew an analogy between old cars and old people, but he overlooked the fact that old people get an additional tax allowance. The Budget put up the age-related personal allowances by more than the rate of inflation—in fact we over-indexed it by another £100. The analogy drawn by the hon. Gentleman makes the Government's case: we help both old people and old vehicles.<br><br>
I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce). I have much sympathy with him in connection with the vehicle that he described, which is like mine in my constituency—my agent said that it is nearly old enough to vote, but it will never make it to 25 years. That makes the point that only a small minority of such cars ever reach the age of 25 or even begin to qualify for classic car status.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
In desperation, the hon. Member for Rotherham is multiplying the cost of the exemptions by 10—he said that they would cost £150 million. The clause that exempts cars, with which we dealt earlier, will, however, cost only £15 million in the first year, and the cost will

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
obviously drop off after the initial surge of exemptions. The new clause will cost only an extra £1 million in the first year, which represents an extremely modest degree of help for a deserving cause. I urge my hon. Friends to support the new clause against the mean-minded killjoys in the Opposition.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the outset of our short discussion on new clause 27, I want to put on record our appreciation of the work of the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) on this subject. I read his remarks in the report of last year's Committee, and I hope that he has noticed that new clause 27 builds on the work that he undertook.<br><br>
Last year's measures allowed the series of non-taxable damage payments to which the victim was entitled under structured settlement agreements to be replaced by an annuity. To maintain uniformity to treatment, the annuity is exempted from tax.<br><br>
The proposed measures extend the exemption to a range of situations that are met with in real life but which fall outside the terms of the legislation. They remove the requirement that the annuity should be purchased only by the person who is responsible for the damages of his insurer. They enable the damages to be payable in the form of an annuity to trustees who act for the victim, and they also extend an exemption to some settlements that are reached outside the United Kingdom and which, because of local practice, cannot be drawn up in a form that would produce non-taxable damages. I hope that the Committee will agree that the proposals will lead to important improvements, and that hon. Members will agree to the new clause and amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We generally welcome the Government's amendment and new clause. As the Financial Secretary was kind enough to say, the provisions build on the work that was started by my hon. Friend the

Member fror Oxford, East last year. They expand it and make it more appropriate and acceptable for the circumstances that face those whom my hon. Friend sought to assist.<br><br>
I note that the Inlands Revenue's press release says that regular payments under a court order would in some cases—at present, presumably—come within the scope of the charge to income tax. How many people have been affected by that in the past year? Can the Minister confirm that they will no longer be affected? Given the nature of the people whom we seek to assist by the new clause and amendments—primarily those who have suffered some injury—is he considering any provisions to assist those who may have had to pay tax in the past year? That was not Parliament's wish, but it may have been the result of the legislation's wording.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I rise with some reluctance to say to the hon. Gentleman that it is difficult to hear him when he talks towards the other end of the Room. Perhaps he could address me in a loud voice. I am 58 next week, and I do not hear quite as well as I used to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary say whether all the provisions in the Law Commission's report "Structured Settlements and Interim and Provisional Damages" have now been implemented? I understand that that was the basis of some of the suggestions that have found their way into the new clause. If they have not, do the Government have any further proposals on the matter?<br><br>
I also welcome the provisions on criminal injuries compensation. Obviously, there has been a considerable difference in the past between the Government and the Opposition over the way in which the Government have dealt with the matter, and there was a big debate last year about the cuts in criminal injuries compensation. What the new clause appears to do—perhaps the Financial Secretary will confirm this—is to regularise, simplify and consolidate the provisions on tax as they affect criminal injuries compensation. The effects will in no way be prejudicial to those who have been the victims of crime. Indeed, I hope that they will enable those people to use their compensation to look after themselves in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to answer the hon. Gentleman's question: I am grateful for his support on this matter. He asked how many people have been taxed on the payments referred to in the Inland Revenue press release. The short answer is none, as yet, because the court orders do not yet take the form required by the new clause. They will, however, be taxed under the Damages Bill. We have introduced these provisions because we anticipate that that Bill will become law.<br><br>
The Government announced that they will accept the Law Commission's recommendations in their entirety. If they are not already enshrined in legislation, they are either in the new clause or will be in the Damages Bill.<br><br>
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995 created a new class of structured settlements for claims to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board—they fell outside the existing exemption, because awards by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
board are not damages as such but represent compensation. The 1995 Act introduced a tax exemption specific to the structured settlements of compensation and that is carried across to the new provisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is beneficial to those who receive such awards.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause amends the control criteria in the context of venture capital trusts. It does not change the benefits that accrue to those who use or invest in venture capital trusts. The rule we originally used to determine control, namely section 416 of the Taxes Act 1988, is stringent and wide-ranging. In our view, it is too stringent and wide-ranging for the way in which venture capital is raised, especially if a company requires the majority of its capital to be provided through venture capital.<br><br>
The new clause modifies that rule in the light of the experience that we have gained from the venture capital

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not oppose the new clause. I am grateful to the Minister for having explained the reasoning behind it and for having written to my hon. Friend thee Member for Oxford, East setting out the Government's intentions.<br><br>
Before the new clause passes into law, it may be appropriate, given that the Government have tabled an amendment, to deal with another concern that is beginning to surface among those with a genuine interest in promoting venture capital. The Committee will recall that when we debated the matter last year when the venture capital trust legislation was introduced, both sides of the House welcomed the aims of the VCT regime. It was thought that there was a shortfall of available capital, especially to small and medium-sized businesses, and that if a fiscal concession were made, money would be available that would not otherwise be so, which would assist a sector that has traditionally had difficulties obtaining access to affordable capital.<br><br>
When the Financial Secretary wrote to my hon. Friend, I was disappointed to learn that only three venture capital trusts have so far been launched and that only a further dozen or so are about to be launched. The slowness of take-up is a matter of concern and, in a moment, I shall suggest another anxiety that has arisen as a result of one of the three VCTs which seems to be encroaching on a matter that none of us intended it should.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Clearly, the Government tabled the new clause because it was suggested to the Treasury that one reason why VCTs were not getting off the ground was that they would not enable investors to control a company in which they might invest. Can the Financial Secretary tell us whether any other representations were made that might throw some light on why there has, apparently, been such a low take-up of VCTs even given that the scheme has been operating for only a year?<br><br>
I have anecdotal evidence. I spoke to the annual dinner of the British Venture Capital Association last December. Indeed, one or two Members of the Committee were present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a very good speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman enjoyed my speech. It is available, free of charge, for anyone who would like to read it.<br><br>
At the dinner, several people who are involved in the industry expressed less than full enthusiasm for the VCT regime and I was wondering whether the Treasury could throw any light on the problem. It could be that the industry believes that opportunities to invest do not exist. In other words, the problem is not a lack of available capital, but a lack of enterprises in which to invest. There is quite a substantial body of thought that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
thinks that that is precisely the problem in Britain at present. As the Government have received representations about the control of companies, I would be surprised were that the only representation. I might be wrong, but I would be surprised. If there were other representations, I would be pleased to hear them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he addresses the issue. I am always anxious to listen to concerns about any subject. Will the hon. Gentleman share with us in a little more detail some of the examples of lack of enthusiasm that he heard at the dinner?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to gauge exactly the mood of the nation—especially at a dinner. As it happens, I was at a dinner in the midlands last night, speaking to a cross-section of business men who I asked about the VCTs because they inquired about incentives in general. We had a useful discussion during which I ask whether there had been much interest in VCTs. The answer was, "No". Most of the people present last night had been discouraged from VCTs possibly because of the business expansion scheme experience, which was not altogether a happy one. They were reluctant to get into another device such as that, and most were standing back to let someone else try out the system—if it worked, others might then come in.<br><br>
There was also a feeling that, as for potential investment opportunities, the field is not as fertile as had been hoped. We returned to the question that is dogging much of British industry: the overlay that we have with problems of job insecurity which mean that people are not spending money. Therefore, people who invent and introduce products for development are reluctant to commit money for investment or to invest their capital because they are not sure that there will be a ready market for their products. However, I will not discuss job insecurity in Committee, no matter what its importance, because I want to concentrate on the VCT problem.<br><br>
When the Financial Secretary concludes the debate, it would be helpful if he could throw any light on what else the Treasury might have picked up. Other members of the Committee might have picked up anecdotal evidence. I do not pretend to have conducted a detailed survey. I would not claim that those who attend dinners such as I have addressed recently represent a random cross-section of the population at large, but it is instructive to speak to people involved in such activities and it is worrying that they have not showed the interest in VCTs that one might have expected.<br><br>
I took the opportunity to take a trawl through various press cuttings to see whether any further light could be thrown on the issue by the specialist press. I saw an article from <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of 14 October 1995 which was headed:
<br><blockquote><p>"VCTs fail to make a splash".</p></blockquote>
The article quotes various people who all say the same thing: that people seem to be holding back and that there is no clear reason for that. The take-up is far less than anyone anticipated when we debated the matter last year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
My attention was drawn to an article that appeared in Glasgow's <i>The Herald</i> on 28 February, under the heading
<br><blockquote><p>"Noble in unusual £20m venture".</p></blockquote>
What I am about to say might seem inconsistent, given that I have been expressing concern that only three VCTs have got off the ground. However, I am concerned about one of those three VCTs because if the report is accurate—and I have no reason to believe that it is not—it has entered the area that, last year, hon. Members said on the Floor of the House VCTs should not enter because their object must surely be to make money available for investment at an affordable price. The article refers to a VCT launch by Noble & Company, an Edinburgh-based finance house that guarantees to return at least 75 per cent. of shareholders' initial investment—the risk element is therefore clearly not as evident as one might have thought. I am concerned that the VCT, the Augustus Trust, will split its net issue proceeds between investments in term loans, gilts and equities; 25 per cent. of the money will be invested in ordinary unquoted shares managed by Northern Venture Managers while another 25 per cent. will be put into five-year gilts. The remaining 50 per cent. will be made available as term loans through Lloyds Bank. Five years after the issue date, its shareholders can require Lloyds to purchase all the loans at original face value plus accrued interest.<br><br>
Another gathering of people involved in the area—I point out to Conservative Members that I was addressing not an audience of Trotskyites but people who have a genuine interest in the industry—questioned whether VCTs should have any object other than providing money for investment. That VCT appears to be almost a derivative of VCTs: it is a safe bet which is investing in loan stock and is therefore not making money available to the sort of start-up businesses that we all wanted to encourage. The Augustus Trust will continue to run, but it is important that we flag up the difficulties so that when the Treasury comes to adjust the VCT regime, it is aware of them.<br><br>
In the article, observers are quoted as describing the VCT as:
<br><blockquote><p>"'A tax-driven vehicle, 'highly bizarre' and 'pushing the rules'".</p></blockquote>
The Edinburgh financial services industry is renowned worldwide for its ingenuity and it generates much employment. I shall not say a word against it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that some of those inventive people do not form our core support so I would not be afraid of saying something offensive if that were necessary. But I question whether those who drew up the VCTs intended to produce a situation in which tax-driven vehicles were being designed on the back of VCT legislation. That was not the intention: the genuine intention was to help small and medium-sized businesses, especially those that have difficulty in getting access to capital. That is what we should be concentrating on. Last year, when we debated the matter the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, now the Secretary of State for Transport, said—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making one of the most powerful cases possible for supporting the amendments next Tuesday on reducing or abolishing capital gains tax. Will he consider using those arguments then? The Government are right to propose tax-driven vehicles to encourage money into venture capital, but they would not be needed at all if the Government reduced or abolished capital gains tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, we shall debate one or more amendments on which his name appears, with more to come next Tuesday apparently. I do not want to debate capital gains tax now, as you might stop me, Mr. Hogg. However, it will be appropriate to discuss that tax when the merits of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Dover, and others, are considered. For now, I should prefer to confine myself to the VCTs.<br><br>
On 25 January last year, the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tax reliefs of this kind are designed to stimulate much-needed investment in business and enterprise and to create jobs rather than new tax loopholes."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 January 1995; Vol. 253, c. 377.]</p></blockquote>
On the face of it, the report in <i>The Herald</i> of 28 February highlights an example of a VCT that is not doing what the then Financial Secretary intended. I draw that matter to the attention of the present Financial Secretary. I should be grateful if he will examine the problem, as we must be careful about giving incentives if they are not used as intended.<br><br>
Fiscal incentives should be given only with great care. Parliament has a duty to ensure that tax relief is used for its intended purpose and that it achieves the intended objectives. I question whether that is happening at present.<br><br>
I have two main worries, the first of which is that the VCTs are being taken up to only a limited extent, if at all. Secondly, where a VCT has been established it has been tax-driven rather than through a genuine desire to make capital available at a price that people can afford and thus encourage the inventiveness that we all want to see.<br><br>
Clearly, there is a limit to what fiscal incentives can achieve. Other considerations apply, such as the Government's general macro-economic policy and the state of the economy. All such matters have a substantial influence on whether a person develops an invention from idea through to profitable production. The question that we must ask is whether a fiscal incentive will cause to exist circumstances that otherwise would not exist. The evidence that VCTs do that is fairly scant, as I have described. What evidence there is leads me to believe that we should ask ourselves whether we should amend the VCT regime or replace it with something more appropriate.<br><br>
I am not being unhelpful, as the Minister knows. One of last year's better debates concerned VCTs, and it contained some thoughtful contributions from hon. Members on the Back Benches and Front Benches of both sides. There was a genuine desire to do something to ease what appeared to be a log jam. I am worried that those laudable objectives have not been realised. There are ominous signs yet again that, when Parliament tries
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 743</span>
to help industry, some clever and inventive people are taking advantage of a scheme in a way that was never intended.<br><br>
We do not want the VCTs to become a real son of the business expansion scheme, which went wildly wrong. I shall so no more than to refer hon. Members to the speech by the present Secretary of State for Health when he was Financial Secretary. That speech—made after the fall of the now Lady Thatcher, when for a brief period Conservative Members could express some free thought—contained one of the best critiques of the BES that I can recall. The then Financial Secretary was right to draw attention to the fact that the scheme had been abused and had been a delight to everyone in the business of tax dodges and the exploitation of granny farming and so on. I do not want the same thing to happen to VCTs. I am genuinely interested in mechanisms that will help ease what is undoubtedly a problem. That is the spirit in which I make these few comments and it would be helpful for the Financial Secretary to respond. He and his officials should carefully consider how to improve the provisions to ensure that we do not end up with another discredited scheme, which would be bad for the country.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to thank the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) for his thoughtful comments and for bringing relevant evidence to the Committee's attention. However, discussing venture capital trusts without mentioning capital gains tax is rather like talking about how to make babies without mentioning sex.<br><br>
I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on being on to a good thing. If he wants to attack the Government about special business reliefs under the present tax regime by referring to accountants who are paid to be cleverer than parliamentary draftsmen, he will always be successful. It will be a rich field for him to mine. I hope that he will pursue his role in Opposition for a very long time.<br><br>
The history of venture capital trusts is the business expansion scheme, which was equally well intentioned. In those days, the Labour party was not pretending to be capital friendly and was then more opposed to BES than it has been to VCTs. The history of the BES is likely to be repeated by VCTs because of the complexity of applying specialised reliefs to particular circumstances and because, as the hon. Gentleman said, accountants are getting round it—as they always do.<br><br>
I spent much of my working life—when I had a proper job—in venture capital. I worked with 3i, the leading venture capital company in the United Kingdom, and with a smaller group, so I can assure the Committee that there is no shortage whatever of venture capital. It is a myth that there is a shortage of capital for ventures of any size. The barrier to investment is not the adequacy of capital but the shortage of good deals available into which capital can be put. The reason for the shortage of good deals is insufficient incentive for the owner-drivers of businesses<br><br>
It is extraordinary that we go to such lengths to create tax-driven vehicles, which typically exclude the people who control and own the business. The experience of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
venture capital elsewhere—especially in the United States—shows how the directors and employees of businesses have to be the main beneficiaries of the tax regime in order to create the right climate for the fast growth of small companies.<br><br>
California is an excellent example: once capital taxation was removed from the owners, directors and employees of businesses, the business angels or entrepreneurs came in and built up some of the fastest growing companies in the world. Entrepreneurs came out of the garages and backyards because they were going for broke to earn their fortunes. That is the context out of which Apple Computers, Bill Gates and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Intuit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is it. If we want that climate for small businesses in this country, we must have the same tax regime. I am against the hon. Gentleman's amendment because it is frittering around at the edges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a Government amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of whatever can be done to ameliorate the misdirected effects of a tax-driven vehicle. Until, however, we address the fundamental issue—which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central is avoiding—we will not create the climate that this country needs for the fast growth of small businesses which are driven by the people who own and manage them and who seek to make fortunes for themselves and their employees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had the good fortune to listen to the speech by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central at the annual dinner of the British Venture Capital Association. Members of the BBC came along very keen to hear about Labour tax policy, but the hon. Gentleman managed to speak for 20 minutes without saying anything about Labour's tax policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well done, Alistair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Oxford, East has made my point for me. In accordance with the Gordon Brown school of politics, it was a very good speech.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin) is entirely right—there is no shortage of capital. There is a shortage of deals and sometimes a shortage of good business managers, two factors that are much more likely to be constraints on investment. I remember discussing with people at that dinner why there were not more venture capital trusts, and that is part of the answer.<br><br>
Another part of the answer is that most of those people are already running successful venture capital funds. If they get a good investment, they are far more likely to put it into their existing fund with their existing institutional shareholders than they are to set up a new fund. Personally, I should be wary about investing in what might be described as their second or third fund. It is unfortunate that it is not possible for private shareholders themselves to invest in venture capital funds.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 745</span>
All the funds are put up by institutional investors. Private investors cannot invest in them because of the way in which they are structured at the moment.<br><br>
I hope that the Government's tax concession, which I certainly support, as I support the new clause, will lead to more investment in new businesses, but I wanted to make the point that there is no shortage at the moment. Plenty of new businesses are set up every day. In my view, there is a high level of business angel activity, although it is hard to judge. As an example, I visited a new dry ski slope in Wycombe at the weekend, which I know was funded by business angels. It is a highly speculative investment, because one has no idea what the revenue from it will be, but it looked to me as if it was funded without any tax breaks at all.<br><br>
The alternative investment market has grown hugely since it was launched by the stock exchange only a few months ago and during that time there have been plenty of placings of new companies on the main stock exchange. Thus, there is much capital raising going on. VCTs can help at the margin, but it is important, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central said, for us to ensure that they invest in the kinds of businesses that we envisaged when we approved the legislation last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also support the new clause. It is a good idea to make progress with the policy in the way in which my hon. Friend outlined.<br><br>
I dispute what my hon. Friends the Members for Colchester, North and for Beaconsfield said about there being no problem with the availability of capital for such purposes. Obviously, the situation is much better than it was some years ago, which is one justification for the Government's measures to encourage such capital raising. But in my experience and that of my constituents, there are still difficulties for those who seek to raise so-called mezzanine capital, in the range of £250,000 to £2 million. Such problems have not gone away completely. I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will be able to tell us about current progress by giving the number—as far as the Treasury knows—of new ventures that have got going under the Government's regime, and their future objectives, as there is still a slight problem in that respect.<br><br>
On a lighter note, I, too, had the good fortune to attend the dinner which was referred to earlier. One of the great things about knowing the hon. Member for Edinburth, Central as well as I do, is that I have a pretty good idea how long he will speak and of his speech's likely light content in respect of Labour tax policy. I was the fortunate person at my table to win the sweepstake on the length of the speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the drawbacks of preparing to respond to these debates is that I cannot go out and enjoy dinners with people involved in venture capital. My forays into the field have shown me that there is enthusiasm. Shortly after I took up this post, I went to the Leeds United football ground—not on the basis of a transfer to a new activity, or a real job, as my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester, North said—to take part in the launch of venture capital trusts in the north of England. I was struck then by the genuine and great interest of the potential investors present in Leeds.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 746</span>
It takes time for new ideas to catch on and I am grateful for the careful and considered way in which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central expressed his views on the success of venture capital trusts. I welcomed the way in which the hon. Gentleman underscored his support for the Government's amendments. That was a small, but helpful, response to the venture capital trust industry, which could see that there were potentially inhibiting factors in the original structure, especially in terms of their participation in a company which may have additional sources of funding. That doubt has been removed; it remains to be seen how much effect it will have, but it is the Government's genuine response to try to add and element of fine tuning and clarification to the way that the trusts work. We have responded to the concerns expressed by the venture capital trust industry.<br><br>
On general themes, I confirm that we intend to monitor the scheme closely so as to respond to developments. That was an underlying theme of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central who sought my reassurance on the more novel and inventive ideas. I tell the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington that, to date, three trusts have been launched and more than £40 million has been raised. Edition No. 10 of the <i>Small Company Investor</i> of March 1996 states that another nine are seeking funds. If they are fully subscribed, as much as £156 million could be involved. The same journal, which has clearly monitored these matters, bears out what my hon. Friends the Members for Carshalton and Wallington, for Colchester, North and for Beaconsfield said about the importance of deals. The advice in that publication to potential investors in venture capital trusts is that.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"if the deal flow is poor, a manager may struggle to get enough cash invested to meet the VCT requirements of at least 70 per cent. of total funds by the end of year three."</p></blockquote>
Those promulgating the venture capital trust gospel probably have that in mind.<br><br>
I accept the arguments advanced in the debate that there are many sources of venture capital funding; we are talking about one, which has brought a further, additional source of money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central I should like to finish my point. At the heart of his first line of questioning was whether the Government had received any representations, which my give us a clue about why matters are not moving as fast as was optimistically expected at the beginning of the policy. I have not received a list or analysis from anyone in the industry. However, the new clause is a response to the concerns about an element of the current legislation that might be an inhibiting factor. Naturally, I am very happy to receive representations and ideas, which we shall consider as part of our review and monitoring operation.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I inform my hon. Friend about what is likely to happen in the market? There may be very few new deals done that would not otherwise have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 747</span>
done by the existing providers of venture capital. The venture capital trusts are not trying to do deals that would not otherwise have been viable—they are simply competing for the same deals. The limitation in the market is the number of good deals. The only thing that might happen is that the extra competition might mean that deals are done on slightly more favourable terms to shareholders and employees than would otherwise be the case. It increases the competition in the market, but is very unlikely to result in new deals that would not otherwise have been done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that we have got moneys into a tightly defined vehicle which will help the venture capital industry. It is a matter of horses for courses. I have talked to companies which have benefited from venture capital. It has the opportunity to come from a number of sources. It is a question of who will advance against a particular offer; it is very much deal based. There may well be different forms of funding of a venture capital nature which would be appropriate to that deal.<br><br>
The value of venture capital trusts is that they offer a particular type of investor an opportunity to enter a scheme that is beneficial and to respond in a way that is beneficial in capital gains tax terms, to pick up on the theme of my hon. Friend's remarks. I do not want to undermine the venture capital trust, which I accept is one of a number of ways of a venture nature in which money may be invested. We should support the new clause on that basis.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central expressed other concerns. One inhibiting factor may be the nature of the winding-up arrangements, and we need to consider that carefully. I have authorised our officials to discuss with the industry some of the issues that arise from that. As I said, I am genuine in my wish to explore what is happening.<br><br>
The hon. gentleman asked a number of questions about specific venture capital trusts offers. He cast doubt, in his own way, about the direction in which some were going. I do not want to indulge in a commentary on individual offers, but it is important to say that from the point of view of the investor and the company which is the beneficiary, the terms of venture capital trusts are tightly drawn. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Noble, which was not one of the three that was initially launched last year. It is on the market, but we have to wait to see what happens regarding the funds that it receives. For those who seek to exchange risk for certainty—which is where innovation comes in—the investor will judge which way he wants to go. The investor may have to sacrifice the rate of return against a formulation of greater certainty.<br><br>
At least 70 per cent. of all venture capital trust investments have to be in qualifying investment. There is nothing in the Bill to stop guaranteed schemes in themselves, but the Inland Revenue, before giving approval, must be satisfied that the conditions of the scheme are likely to be met. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall keep these schemes under review, because it is important that the objectives continue to be met. I hope that that gives him some comfort.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Colchester, North and for Dover touched briefly on capital gains tax,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 748</span>
which we shall be debating later. There is always a price to pay for any easement of any tax as there are gains to be made. However, there are capital gains tax benefits for those who invest in venture capital trusts. That is to be welcomed.<br><br>
I welcome the comments that have been made. I hope that I have given the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central a satisfactory earnest of our good intention to keep the matters under clause review. I welcome the support from both sides of the Committee for the concept of venture capital trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been a useful debate. One or two matters arise from earlier comments by the hon. Member for Colchester, North. I do not want to talk about capital gains tax, which is the subject to a separate amendment, but I accept that it is not possible to consider one tax regime in isolation from others. They all have a bearing on the likelihood of development. The hon. Gentleman might, given his opening remarks, want to look at the story in today's edition of <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> on the theme, when sheep are sheep and when men are concerned. He will see that he is not quite right in his assertion about sex and babies. I commend the entrepreneurial spirit shown by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> in leaving bales of the paper on the Birmingham shuttle. That must do wonders for its circulation, and it certainly provides a way of spending time when the train, inexplicably and for every-increasing periods, stops as a result of various infrastructure defects on the west coast line.<br><br>
I accept, in relation to VCTs, that a great deal of help is available by way of incentives and other means of providing capital, such as the business angels that were mentioned. it seems to be common ground, at least with those Conservative Members who spoke on the matter, that part of the problem is, in the words of the hon. Member for Colchester, North, an absence of good deals. That says something about the general flatness of the economy, about which the hon. Gentleman will no doubt want to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Question Time this afternoon. Two problems exist—obtaining capital at the right price and obtaining opportunities to invest. That requires a general climate in which economic activity is more likely than not. The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight that matter as a major current problem. As he was so highly critical of the Government amendments earlier, perhaps he will pursue the logic of his theme this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Contrary to what I said earlier, I thought the Minister was utterly convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard it said that the hon. Member for Colchester, North is working his passage back into favour in the hope that he will get something before the general election, having been a Euro-sceptic. Possibly, given the Chancellor's stance on a referendum, he will have to part company with the present Treasury Bench once again.<br><br>
The Minister has given an assurance to keep under review the matter that we have been discussing. As to the Noble trust, I did not say that it was not within the rules; patently it is. I meant that the rules may need adjustment or amendment if taxpayers' money is being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 749</span>
used inappropriately. We must not forget that tax forgone is taxpayers' money. The Government must raise additional revenues to fund tax concessions. if tax concessions are not achieving what Parliament wants them to, we should examine them again.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for what he said on the matter. He and I are possibly marginally closer to each other in our views on this subject than he is to some of his hon. Friends on the Back Benches.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
We want to delay introduction of self-assessment for a year. Self-assessment has been described as the biggest change to the tax system since the introduction of income tax in 1803. By comparison, it is suggested, the introduction of pay-as-you-earn in 1945 was simply tinkering around the edges. It is, indeed, an enormous change, affecting about 9 million businesses and self-employed people. We should tackle a change of that proportion with care, and have full and proper consultation. We must get it right to build confidence in self-assessment. The Labour party wants to get it right. We do not want the new method of collecting and assessing taxes to suffer a crisis of confidence in its first year. We fear that such a crisis could occur because of the rushed way in which the new system is being introduced.<br><br>
The proposal is part of what could be described as Child Support Agency syndrome, which affects several Government policies. In the Bill, it affects loan relationships and also self-assessment, which is a good idea that will save the taxpayer money and perhaps reduce Government expenditure, but it is being rushed in. The Government no doubt believe that the loss of 3,000 Inland Revenue jobs is worth the cost-saving bonus. The Inland Revenue officials who will lose their jobs probably do not regard it in the same light, nevertheless the system will be introduced with a cost-saving bonus.<br><br>
The Government have decided to proceed without the necessary consultation. That is not only the Opposition's view. It is shared by many business organisations and many of my constituents who are involved in business. I asked what they knew about selfassessment—a big change that would directly affect them. Some said that it was a good idea, but that they did not know much about it. Others, especially accountants, who had been involved in planning for it and examining it from an early stage, and had regularly read the trade press believed that they understood it. They were under an illusion, because the Bill introduces 54 pages of alterations and expansions. Those accountants who believed that they were on top of the new system have a further mountain to climb.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
Many people whom I canvassed simply did not know enough about self-assessment. When I raised that matter in the Chamber and in Committee, it was suggested that there would always be some people who did not understand or were not prepared for a change in tax procedure. I accept that. There will always be a group of business people who are too rushed by the daily grind of ensuring the company's survival, that jobs still exist and that profits continue to be made. However, when a big tax change is proposed, a proper publicity campaign, and consultation with the business community can reduce substantially the number of people who do not know what is happening and are not prepared for self-assessment. Those people will suffer if they fail to deal with self-assessment properly because the provisions contain various penalties that might affect them.<br><br>
A year's delay will be beneficial. It will enable the Government to undertake an improved publicity campaign, and consultation and discussion with the business community, not to change the rules—we have changed them time and again—but to ensure that the business community is properly informed about self-assessment. We need to give more time to understand. We also need to ensure that when that is introduced, Inland Revenue staff are fully trained and fully cognisant of the detail of the provisions, so that they can be of assistance to the employers, employees and self-employed who must deal with them.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
We have heard from the representatives of the Inland Revenue staff that there is some concern about the way in which that training has been undertaken so far. We want to give the Government more time to ensure that the provision works. They need time to inspire confidence in self-assessment and the new clause would provide that.<br><br>
There are also concerns that the right computer system, such as electronic lodgment, are in place. Doubt about that has been expressed in sections of the computer trade press. I recently saw an article about a shift of resources away from the corporation tax computer systems and software provision to those on self-assessment because there was concern at the delay in putting together the software to deal with self-assessment. I have already mentioned that issue and the Financial Secretary has, to some extent, given an answer. There are concerns and unless there is confidence when the scheme starts, there will be no confidence in carrying it out as it progresses. We could then experience the crisis to which I have already referred.<br><br>
We have already seen, in the Bill, amendments piled on amendments relating to impossibly complicated legislation. We have just dealt with loan relationships, which was even more difficult than self-assessment. Self-assessment was complex enough when we were expecting ordinary business people and the self-employed to understand and be able to fill in their forms according to the rules. That concern has been expressed by a number of business organisations.<br><br>
I have already read to the Committee, and will not do so again, the letter that we received from the British Retail Consortium. Employers with 2.1 million employees want a one-year delay. They are concerned about uncertain interpretation of amendments piled on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
amendments. Clause 112, which is the first to deal with self-assessment, is an amendment of an amendment of an amendment. That bizarre complexity will give rise to ambiguity and inadequate and uncertain interpretation. It is important to give people that extra year to get used to the change, to ensure that accountants fully understand it and to ensure that the intricacies have been covered in the trade press.<br><br>
The British Retail consortium also expressed its concern about inadequate briefings and the lack of potential support for employers when they must deal with this subject in answering queries from employees. It has expressed the need for further consultation with employers. The Federation of Small Businessess has expressed concern. If the Government will not listen to us, let them listen to the employers and those who have reason to be concerned about the way in which the proposals are being rushed in.<br><br>
We do not want self-elected accountants to set up in the high street and say that they can assist all those worried self-employed people who previously did not need an accountant, but now think that they must have one because of the introduction of self-assessment. That business is not yet regulated as it should be. The Government might use the year with which the new clause would provide them to assess the need for regulation in that area. We do not want people to go to Fred down the road to sort out their accounts and then get into trouble with the penalty clauses that self-assessment will introduce.<br><br>
Everyone who we consulted supports that principle. Everyone wants the proposal to be a success. We want to ensure that it is done properly. We want to create confidence in the proposal. The Government are not giving adequate assurance to satisfy employers and the Opposition that this can be introduced in the successful and confident way that we all want. The operation of self-assessment should have long-term viability. That does not exist at present. The new clause would provide a valuable year's delay which would give the Government time to put in place the structures, the consultation and advice systems that will enable self-assessment to work properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a pretty tired old speech which we have already heard twice before. We debated self-assessment during the Committee proceedings on the Floor of the House and the hon. Gentleman made that speech then. He made the same speech again on 20 February at columns 381 and 382. He made the same tired old points. But there is an important difference. That was 16 days ago and we have moved on. Self-assessment is due to start in 29 days' time. The hon. Gentleman still tells us that it should be postponed for a year. We have now reached the point at which it would be chaotic to postpone it. It would be far more damaging to postpone it now than to go ahead. Everyone who is required to keep tax records for self-assessment must start doing so on 6 April this year.<br><br>
The members of the Committee are rather inclined to talk as though self-assessment was somehow coming in next year. The returns that drop on to door mats in May next year, however, will relate to the tax year which is due to start on 6 April. Employers have a new statutory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
obligation to keep records in such a form that when the due time comes they will be able to provide the information for their employees to complete their self-assessment forms. That starts on 6 April, in 29 days' time. Employers are now geared up to make that change and to start keeping those records. I have no intention of repeating all the arguments that I put forward when I spoke on this before. We have moved on and it would be damaging to postpone the introduction of self-assessment in the way that the Labour party proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire for repeating a speech in a more dramatic and coherent form because we are approaching the point of no return. An awful lot of mud has to be thrown at the arrogant wall of Tory Treasury pigheadedness before any of it sticks. While it is a pain for my hon. Friend to repeat himself, because he is a man who likes to be fresh and original in all his speeches and remarks, as we have all learned to our pleasure and benefit in the course of our proceedings, there are no new arguments on this under the sun.<br><br>
Self-assessment will be the child of poll tax and the grandchild of the Child Support Agency. I stand to be corrected but I think that I am the only member of the Committee who has lived, worked and paid income tax under a self-assessment system for many years. I can therefore assure the Minister that, as devised under his regime, this self-assessment scheme will come back to haunt its creators.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has difficulty working out his own taxes, God help this country if the Labour party works out taxes for the rest of us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I do not have the same external sources of income as the hon. Gentleman and most of his colleagues on the Conservative Benches. It is simple to fill in my tax return.<br><br>
I add a word of warning to my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench. Before long, I expect that they will be responsible for implementing these measures and I hope that they will put it on record that the principle of festina lente—make haste slowly—must apply. The form is complex and it will hit those people who are not accustomed to filling in tax returns and who do not have financial advisers and accountants. The object of self-assessment is, quite rightly, to cover the broad mass of income tax payers. However, the form is so devised that, when self-assessment becomes part of the tax collection system, it will create such headaches that Ministers in office at that time will have to answer an awful lot of angry questions.<br><br>
I support the amendment. In the interests of getting things right, I hope that the Government will take it seriously. I invite my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire to keep making such important points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Member for Rotherham that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, the world has moved on. If someone does not want to calculate his tax under self-assessment and he returns the form by 30 September in the relevant year, he will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
not have to. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but he does not know the facts. He has spoken with characteristic ignorance. Under the new form, the return of the information required for self-assessment is separated from calculation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have heard enough of the Opposition's wearying arguments on this. I want to tell the hon. Gentleman that life will be exceedingly simple for the second generation to use the system. The system has been tried in Leicester, so we are not sleepwalking into it. We have tried it with real taxpayers and we are not about to try it out on 13,000 more. We are determined to get it absolutely right.<br><br>
The press will be full of advertisements about self-assessment and they will blot out some of the propaganda opportunities that the Opposition have taken. The Opposition have not referred to the huge amount of consultation that has taken place over the past five years or to the work of the standing advisory committee on self-assessment, the 1.2 million employer packs that have been sent out, the 3,500 free seminars that have been held, the 85,000 accountants that we have contracted and the 4,000 tax inquiry centres, which are ready, able and willing to answer questions about the system. Never has a more evangelical campaign been mounted by the Inland Revenue. It will make certain that self-assessment will work. At night, during the day, at weekend or whenever the taxpayer wants it, information will be available.<br><br>
I made it clear on the Floor of the House that this is one of the most thoroughly prepared changes to have ever taken place. It will effectively gather in the same taxes that people are used of paying now. The characteristics of the payment do not alter as a result of self-assessment. Only the way in which people return information to the Inland Revenue will change.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire mentioned the British Retail Consortium. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman by telling him that the Revenue met the British Retail Consortium on 21 February and it explained the plans for information and education in detail. The consortium left the meeting reassured and it knows that we shall work with it and other organizations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
to respond positively to their worries about self-assessment. We genuinely want to carry on the exercise of listening, consulting and informing. That is one of our major tasks.<br><br>
On the seminars providing information held so far, our research shows that 90 per cent. of those attending thought that the information that they were given was useful. We are making every effort to making self-assessment a success and a boost for the Inland Revenue. One of the offshoots will be an improvement in overall compliance work. That benefit will be a result of self-assessment.<br><br>
I commend self-assessment to the Committee. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was exactly the same old stuff from the same old Minister. He did not answer the questions; he did not deal with the problems facing business and he did not deal with the £850 million tax bombshell that is being prepared by this Tory Government for the self-employed and small businesses. The scheme is an own goal scored by the Tories. It will come back to haunt them at the next election.</span></p>
