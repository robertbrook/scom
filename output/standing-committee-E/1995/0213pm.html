<p><i>Question proposed [this day]:</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a delight to have you, Mr. Hogg, in the Chair after our proceedings this morning.<br><br>
Before lunch I was debating the Conservatives' record on imposing tax burdens on the individual. I should like to ask my hon. Friends what Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Greece, Ireland and Spain have in common.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A high rate of tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw), as astute as ever, has nearly got the right answer. I was endeavouring to point out this morning that all those countries, according to the OECD, which investigated the tax and social security burden as a percentage of gross domestic product, have a higher rate than that of the United Kingdom. At 33.6 per cent., our system stands a good comparison with all of those countries.<br><br>
Whatever the outcome of our debate in Committee, the figures show how low is our burden of tax relative to our competitors. That would not be the case if it had been left to our political opponents, who would have signed up to the social chapter. I would not then have been able to declare those excellent figures to the Committee. To quote the latest soundbite from the Opposition, that particular penny has dropped.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Dover and for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Norman) took us into the realms of the so-called flat tax. I trembled the first time that I heard the term. In my previous incarnation in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a predatory worm known as the New Zealand flat worm was on the rampage, gobbling up our domestic worms. That is why any term that includes the word "flat" gives me great cause for anxiety. Having heard the arguments put forward by my hon. Friends in favour of the flat tax, perhaps I should not be so concerned, but I wish to deal with some of the points that they raised.<br><br>
It is interesting that the debate on future ideas for tax emanated from this side of the Committee. Clearly, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
have good and robust policies which, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor argued, underpin the clause. Future thinking about how to deal with tax seems equally to lie with the Conservatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not clear that the Opposition still believe in a flat earth?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that by the time the Committee concludes, most of them will have fallen off the end of it.<br><br>
I can endorse my hon. Friends' thinking on the subject of tax simplification. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), who tabled a clause that was accepted in last year's Finance Bill, has helped to lead the way on making the future tax system simpler than the present one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: While he is giving us the benefit of his views on a flat-rate tax, will the Minister tell us whether he will accept his hon. Friends' suggestions—that the flat-rate tax be considered for the future—or has he ruled them out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates my remarks. There remain some queries, but my hon. Friends are at the margins of thinking on the subject. They are putting forward ideas that should be considered by anyone thinking about the future of taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister is saying that the proposals for a flat tax will be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who became involved with tax systems would have to think about them so that he could decide whether to rule them in or out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister has not ruled out the possibility of a flat tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should contain himself. If he becomes so excited about this issue, goodness knows how excited he will be about some of more thrilling ideas to which we have yet to come. I am duty bound to comment on my colleagues' comments.<br><br>
It is perhaps germane to our debate on tax, tax simplification and tax burden to say that the Conservatives are the party of tax simplifiers—it is worth refreshing our memories about that. Since 1979, we have reduced the 11 rates of income tax to just three. We have abolished investment income surcharge and several minor allowances and reliefs such as life assurance, housekeeper allowance and dependent relative allowance. We have reduced tax rates generally and rationalised business taxation by removing several distortions. We have abolished petroleum revenue tax for new oil fields and capital transfer tax. We have introduced independent taxation for married women—a major reform of our tax system. We have made the administration of the tax system more efficient and customer focused. We are, therefore, well on the way towards addressing complexity and_ illustrating that the Conservative party stands for simplifying and improving the tax system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why has the Minister not mentioned the taxes that the Government have introduced, invented or doubled?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dealt adequately with that issue earlier. I said that clause 64 was about reducing tax and that we had shot Labour's fox on the issue of its missing 10p tax, which was disguised as borrowing. I shall not entertain the hon. Member's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister brazenly claims to have simplified tax legislation. According to a report that he signed, the Finance Act 1988 contained 154 pages on Inland Revenue legislation; the Finance Act 1995 contained 309, and the relevant portion of the Bill is even longer. If that is simplification, what is the English language?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might cure his insomnia by re-reading some of those Acts and finding out which parts of them repeal legislation. We shall come later to pages in the Bill that do away with existing statute. Sometimes, of course, the Government have to increase the length of Finance Bills. The fact, however, that the hon. Gentleman can quote from my report illustrates that we are determined to do better, and we can take pride in that.<br><br>
When they outlined their philosophy on the flat tax, my hon. Friends the Members for Dover and for Carshalton and Wallington mentioned costs, and I should say what those would be. They mentioned a 15 per cent. flat tax with a tax-free allowance of £7,000, but that would cost £32 billion. With a tax-free allowance of £7,000, the rate would have to rise to 27 per cent. for the tax to be revenue neutral. One of my hon. Friends mentioned a 15 per cent. rate with a £5,000 tax-free allowance—that would cost £26 billion. My hon. Friends would, therefore, have to deal with some big money issues if they pursued their line of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend realise that those figures are based on first order effects—on the first tax year? A major part of mine and my hon. Friend's argument was that our proposed tax structure would raise more revenue for a given state of the economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I noted those points, which will certainly be the subject of further debate. Serious sums of money are, however, involved and my hon. Friend would understand the enormity of the step were we to follow either of the proposed lines of argument.<br><br>
I do not entirely share my hon. Friend's opinion that he would not want a tax system that could influence people's behaviour. For example, under his proposals, we would have to get rid of venture capital trusts, personal equity plans and tax-exempt special savings accounts—which have proved very popular—in spite of the fact that we continue to pursue our aim of a 20 per cent. basic rate of tax. That is a long-term objective and one that my hon. Friend knows will result in a simpler tax system. Obviously, I shall read and digest comments made by my hon. Friends about a flat tax. I hope that my few remarks may suggest my attitude to the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the main point that there is far less to be gained from a flat-rate tax in the United Kingdom than there would be in the United States, for the very reason given by my hon. Friend. Since 1979, when we had about nine different rates of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
tax and a complex structure, we have done away with much of the system. Now we have only three rates of tax, fewer allowances and a much simpler system, so there would be much less to be gained from the proposed change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend demonstrates his considerable knowlege of tax systems. He will understand that, in addition to the basic tax system in America, there are various forms of levy at state level such as sales taxes and other complicating features, which we do not have in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I want to sum up on the subject, especially in the light of comments made by the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). He took us down various routes to explain why he chastised the Government for their current policies and tried to tell us that, under our tax proposals, people would be worse off in some way, shape or form. He cited the last year as an example. I do not disagree with his analysis as far as the taxes and prices index is concerned, but he performed a typical piece of selective reporting. By next year—in real terms since 1978–79—a family on average earning is expected to be £4,500 better off under this Government. That is the real gain of the policies that we have pursued. Under Labour, real take-home pay grew by a miserly 1 per cent. That is the Opposition's record compared to ours and I am much happier fighting for ours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the £450 claim that the Chancellor and other Conservative Members made for the forthcoming year and to which the Financial Secretary referred, does he accept that the long list of charges and extra impositions that I went through erode that benefit?<br><br>
I have a specific point to put to the Financial Secretary: the Chancellor has conceded that his assumption, which underpins the claim, is of a 1¾ per cent. increase in real earnings for the forthcoming year. Even assuming that the Government got inflation down to their stated target of 2½ per cent., that would require 4¼ per cent. increase in real earnings. Can the Financial Secretary guarantee that a nurse who is presently offered 2 per cent. nationally will receive the 2¼ per cent. necessary to fulfil his assumption for next year, even before all those extra charges and the council tax have had to be paid?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is typical of the Opposition, who have missed some of our most important developments in managing the health service, where many decisions are, quite rightly, devolved to local level where local circumstances and factors can be taken into account. I shall not be drawn into that subject, although I shall happily be drawn into defending my statement and repudiating some of the many charges made by the hon. Member for Oxford, East. He proved his singular lack of understanding. If the average family on the average wage is £450 a year better off in real terms, that must, by definition, take into account inflation, which includes any changes in council tax, petrol prices, television licences and so on. I stand by my figures and repudiate the hon. Gentleman's charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have to correct that statement because the Chancellor made it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
clear that his estimate was based on a combination of the tax charges arising solely from the Budget—from memory, slightly more than £2 for a typical family—and real earnings growth. It does not take into account increases in tube and rail fares, council tax and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand by what I said. I would not want to mislead the hon. Gentleman, as there was some debate on this at the time of the Budget. I agree that the tax effect on the average family is £190 per year. However, the combined effects of the Budget will result in an economy that will generate the Chancellor's forecast of an increase in earnings. Taken together, the two factors produce that perfectly respectable figure. The influence of other factors, such as the inflation rate and the reduction in the mortgage interest rate, mean that I have made my case.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his excellent contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) made an important point about the distributional effects of the Budget and of the Conservative record as a whole. My hon. Friend drew the Committee's attention to the recommendation of the Treasury Select Committee that
<br><blockquote><p>"in future, the Government should include information on the distributional impact of tax changes in the"</p></blockquote>
Financial Statement and Budget Report. Will the Minister give an undertaking that that will be done?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the time comes to respond to the Select Committee, we shall give our views on that point. However, all of those matters can be debated and developed, in public print or in the House of Commons, as the necessary information is available in the Red Book.<br><br>
For all the reasons that I gave, in terms of the British economy's generally good performance and the benefits to the public of clause 64, I hope that the Committee will agree that it should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take new clause 7—</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p><i>Information on application of lower rate to income from savings vehicles</i>—

and new clause 8—</p>
<p><i>Application of lower rate to income from savings on arrangements for charitable covenants</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>" .—(1) The Inland Revenue shall prepare and present to Treasury Ministers a report of the compliance cost assessment on the impact of the implementation of the application of lower rate to income from savings on arrangements for charitable covenants made between taxpayers and charities.</p></blockquote>

<br><blockquote><p>The report:
<ol>
<li>shall make an assessment of the compliance cost to the Revenue; and</li>
<li>shall make an assessment of the compliance cost to taxpayers.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 65 reduces the rate of tax on income from savings from the basic rate to the lower rate of 20 per cent. I shall resist the temptation to list again the Government's 22 tax increases, about which we spoke in the previous debate, but the Government's record makes that cut in tax on income from savings all the more welcome. The Labour party supports the clause.<br><br>
The Inland Revenue news release announcing the relief stated that the Chancellor intended to
<br><blockquote><p>"reduce income tax for those with modest savings"</p></blockquote>
and to "reward and encourage saving". Those are laudable aims. Of course it makes sense to do more to encourage saving, especially when today's and tomorrow's generation of workers will need to make better and funded provision for retirement while at the same time meeting the pay-as-you go obligations towards the existing generation of pensioners.<br><br>
Saving has an important role in that, and it is crucial in raising the levels of productive and profitable investment. That is why the Labour party is committed to the principles of TESSAs and PEPs, and why we have said that we want to find new ways of encouraging saving for the longer term and of widening that encouragement to include more people. At the time of the Budget, my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) set out our proposal for a new long-term individual savings account precisely to promote such long-term saving.<br><br>
I imagine that the Committee will display a good deal of support—perhaps even unanimous support—for the new 20 per cent. rate on savings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman say how the long-term savings account would work? Would tax relief be available on the money up front, as it went into the account, or would the account simply provide income and capital gains free of tax?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tax relief would be geared to encouraging savers to invest in the long-term, with relief becoming available and payable over a period of years. We are consulting on various ways in which that could be done.<br><br>
The 20 per cent. tax rate on savings, as provided in the clause, is generally welcomed, but, as ever with the United Kingdom tax system given its underlying complexity, even this apparently simple proposal raises a number of questions. Like other members of the Committee, I have received representations from a number of bodies that have made helpful observations. I am grateful to the Association of British Insurers, the London chamber of commerce, the Law Society's revenue law committee and the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and to the Law Society of Scotland, which provided useful comments on the application of the clause to the position under Scottish law. I shall refer later to the complexities of the implications of the provision to which those bodies have drawn attention.<br><br>
I should like to refer now to new clauses 7 and 8, which the Opposition have tabled and which are grouped with clause 65. The purpose of the new clauses is to help Parliament to evaluate the Government's policy on the taxation of savings. The public have a right to know, in as simple and accessible a way possible, whether the Government's proposals are fair, how they will encourage saving, how they will contribute towards a simpler tax system, about which Conservative Members were waxing lyrical a few moments ago, and how the tax treatment of different savings vehicles compares.<br><br>
The reduction in the tax charge levied on interest received is an important tax concession, not least because it will have an impact on the savings vehicles used by the mass of people in this country. Indeed, they are often the only methods of saving used by many of the poorest people who are the least well informed about the operation of the system. There is a strong argument that those people have been disadvantaged by not having had access to a low rate of taxation on savings in building society and bank accounts, which is their habitual way of saving.<br><br>
The Government's proposals, however, do not create a level playing field across all savings vehicles, and savers may still find that decisions made some time ago provide a more or less favourable regime than they assumed when they made their decisions. We want to encourage people to make saving a long-term activity. It is not unreasonable for taxpayers to expect some overall fiscal strategy and some consistency of principle to underline the Government's approach, especially when the Government have been responsible for the Budget for the past 17 years.<br><br>
I want to give some examples of savings vehicles that will not attract the 20 per cent. rate of tax. I am sure that tax and accounting professionals, not least those on the Committee, will be able to add to the list that I am about to provide. Will the Minister tell us whether the reform this year is a one-off or whether it is part of a more comprehensive strategy on the reform and simplication of the taxation of savings, and in what direction does he see that leading?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
Some savings vehicles will not attract the 20 per cent. rate of tax. Annuities, other than purchased life annuities, will not benefit from the lower rate. Savings distributed by a discretionary trust will not benefit from the reduced rate, which will further complicate inheritance taxation. Life assurance companies that undertake pensions business will be taxed in a different way from those that handle only life business—later we shall debate amendments tabled by the Government and by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, which deal with the complexities and difficulties to which that difference will give rise.<br><br>
How consistent is the legislation, how adequately has it been drafted and how comprehensible is the policy, not only to professionals but to lay people, especially savers who are trying to make informed choices?<br><br>
A typical saver is confronted by a variegated picture. National savings certificates are tax-free when the money goes in and when it goes out. Banks and building societies give a higher pre-tax return but there is then a tax charge of 20 per cent. on interest. Life assurance policies attract favourable treatment when the funds accumulate. Indeed, policies that were taken out before March 1984 also obtain some tax relief on contributions. Occupational pensions—the major savings vehicle for many of our citizens—attract favourable tax relief on the funds that are invested and accumulated but are subject to pension tax not at the 20 per cent. rate but at the taxpayers' marginal rate, in the same way as earned income. Personal pensions operate in a similar way to occupational pensions but their rules and reliefs differ in detail.<br><br>
There is another regime for equities, unit trusts and Government fixed-interest stock. TESSAs and PEPs appear simple, since there is no tax impact on the money going in or coming out, but they have more rules. Money must be held in TESSAs for five years without withdrawing interest or capital and there are limits on the annual amount that can be invested in PEPs. I could go on to talk about the enterprise investment scheme, the venture capital trust and entrepreneur's relief.<br><br>
There is, therefore, confusion in the comparison of savings vehicles, which has been created primarily by the tax system, and not by the differing needs of savers and borrowers. If the tax on some savings income is reduced, when people note the tax change they might not necessarily save more and consume less. There must be a danger that they will consume more, rather than trying to navigate the fiscal undergrowth that the tax system and actions of successive Governments have created.<br><br>
There is an element of retrospection in the tax treatment of savings. A different regime will impact on people's savings decisions, which they made some time ago under different rules and tax treatment. Yet, as I said, many aspects of savings are, in their nature, long term. Unlike decisions on consumption, decisions on savings and investment are difficult to change in the short term.<br><br>
New clause 7 would require the Treasury to publish a table that lists all the ways in which people can save and the taxation on each savings vehicle. That would be a useful thing to have in the Red Book. Such information
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
would be of benefit to the Government when they plan their savings strategy and of great benefit to Parliament in understanding and evaluating the likely effect of proposed changes. Taxpayers would also have a clearer idea of what their choices are. Perhaps most importantly, it would keep the variegated picture in front of successive teams of Treasury Ministers, Parliament, Standing Committees and the Select Committee so that we could monitor how consistently the principles of fiscal approach run through the tax treatment of savings.<br><br>
I return to the representations of the Law Society of Scotland, after which I shall talk about other aspects of the complexity that affects people who make covenants out of saved income. I understand that a particular complexity may affect the position of trusts under Scottish law. The paper from the Law Society of Scotland points out that Scottish taxpayers have to rely on the complexities of section 118 of the Finance Act 1993
<br><blockquote><p>"to decide how to treat payments of income from a trust. That section contains terms … not readily applicable to Scots law. Unaware of what an equitable right in possession is Scottish taxpayers have to deal with the tax treatment of annuities and the tax treatment of any balance of income after satisfaction of the annuity."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society is seeking
<br><blockquote><p>"confirmation from the Inland Revenue that the lower rate of tax will apply to beneficiaries who receive income from Scottish Liferent Trusts."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"While under the general law of Scotland, the beneficiaries' source of income is the Trust rather than the underlying investments, The Society takes it that the Finance Act 1993 Section 118 is expected to put beneficiaries of Scottish Trusts in the same position as beneficiaries of English Trusts in respect of such income."</p></blockquote>
5 pm<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm that in his reply. The Law Society also asks whether it is the case that
<br><blockquote><p>"payments made by Trustees in the exercise of their discretion, where the Trustees are liable to additional rate tax under Section 687, will not attract the lower rate of tax in the hands of beneficiaries even if the income which has given rise to the distribution itself has attracted lower rate tax?"</p></blockquote>
It asks whether that is correct and for the policy reason behind the decision. I shall pass that quote across to the Minister so that he has the opportunity to make sense of it. It raises an important point of Scottish law which deserves a proper answer.<br><br>
New clause 8 raises an issue that has been put to us by a number of professional bodies. They have argued that the 20 per cent. relief on some savings contributes to the complication of the income tax rate structure, which causes problems for savers and may add to the difficulties of self-assessment for those affected. We should all be worried about the elderly, especially those whose complex fiscal affairs reflect the various ways in which they have made provision throughout their lives for their old age.<br><br>
The new clause calls for a report to be compiled on the impact of the lower rate on savings and on the compliance cost assessment of the impact on charity covenants made by the elderly. I shall provide an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
example of the added complexity so that the Committee can understand the need to address the problem.<br><br>
People who have entered covenants with charities or made gift aid donations and who pay those covenants out of income from savings may find themselves subject to an unexpected liability in order to account for the extra 4 per cent. to the Inland Revenue. Elderly people may have to pay an additional £5 on every £100 that they pay to charity. As I said, in addition to the extra cost, self-assessment will be made more difficult. Let us hope that it will not happen, but contributions to charity may be discouraged.<br><br>
To provide a specific example, a covenant of £100 a year for a 24 per cent. basic rate taxpayer will currently enable a charity to reclaim £31 from Inland Revenue—24 per cent. of £131 is £31. If the income were from savings, it would be taxed at a lower rate but the charity could still reclaim £31. Inland Revenue would only tax the £100 income funding the covenant at an implicit rate of 20 per cent. so it could claim the 4 per cent. difference, which amounts to £5–4/24ths of £31—from the taxpayer. Will the Minister confirm whether that is the case and tell us what guidance will be given to taxpayers so affected? Does he acknowledge that the measure might create considerable difficulties and anxieties under the self-assessment regime? Although in the circumstances it might not be an irrational response, it would be a pity if people allowed covenants to lapse rather than suffer both the cash-flow effect and the administrative burden which the measure imposes. New clause 8 aims to shed some light on the options available to deal with the difficulty.<br><br>
We welcome the lower rate on savings in the clause, but, through our new clauses, we want to encourage further Government thinking on the true implications for savers of their policies. We want also to tease out whether the proposal is considered as a one-off or as part of a wider strategy on the tax treatment of savings. That might bring about consistency, simplicity, stability and predictability against which people can plan and save for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, wish to make a brief intervention to welcome clause 65 for some of the reasons already mentioned by the hon. Member for Oxford, East. The clause also gives the Committee the opportunity to explore a little more what the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East might have in mind for their idea about long-term individual savings accounts.<br><br>
It would perhaps be helpful for the Committee and the country to know whether the hon. Member for Oxford, East envisages that tax relief would be available for contributions into such accounts, for the course of investments in the funds and for the pay-out from those funds at the end of the term. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could enlighten us, either now or later, on whether he considers that such an account could be more flexible by being available for partial withdrawal by the people in whose names it was registered for other purposes—for example, for training or other eventualities such as acute sickness during their lifetimes before the fund matured. The hon. Gentleman ought to turn his mind to such questions if he and his hon. Friends have not already done so, in order that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
Committee has a clearer idea of the policy choices between the two sides of the Committee.<br><br>
In my speech this morning, I said that there was obviously an important connection between the taxation of income and the taxation or the tax shelter for savings. We must consider the two debates together to some extent. As long as we have a tax system which consists of multiple tax rates and many tax shelters, I suggest that the hon. Member for Oxford, East would do very much better to examine a scheme as simple as is possible—he professes to support simplicity—under the heading of personal investment plans, instead of personal equity plans. That would provide a broader concept, under which a certain sum of money—let us say £10,000 a year every year—would be available to the individual. The Revenue need not know about that sum, which would be individually certified and consistent with self-assessment; its tax exemption would be completely neutral between all savings vehicles—those that now exist and those that might exist in future.<br><br>
New Clause 7 illustrates the complexity of current savings vehicles. I suggest that the hon. Gentlemen think along the lines of the scheme that I mentioned on Second Reading. The important thing is that compliance costs, churning costs and displacement costs, which are all involved in the savings industry, should be kept to the minimum for both the Revenue—the public sector cost—and for the private sector; otherwise every new form of tax relief, introduced with the best of intentions by successive Chancellors, merely displaces savings from one vehicle to another—it becomes the flavour of the year to go this way, not that. The new vehicle does not increase aggregate savings, although that was one of the main objectives of the hon. Member for Oxford, East—he wanted to boost the overall savings ratio, increase investment and introduce a greater investment preference into the economy.<br><br>
I suggest those points to the hon. Gentlemen in the spirit of friendliness. I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will take note of them because I have been talking about a simple scheme to encourage personal savings for about two years. On previous form, it is about ripe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the outset, I thank the hon. Member for Oxford, East for the courteous and careful presentation of his arguments. He is right to probe and to seek clarification when he feels that that is necessary. I shall do my best to deal with his concerns.<br><br>
I have noted the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington and shall read them carefully in the <i>Official Report.</i> They show again that the new ideas have come from those on the Conservative Benches.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East welcomed the clause, and I am grateful for his support. It was interesting that he said that he was consulting on ideas—We look forward to hearing something specific from the Opposition. It would be a joy to have something to get our teeth into, instead of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
Opposition's smoke and mirrors approach to the ideas that we have debated.<br><br>
We should remember that the Labour party introduced an investment income surcharge, which was imposed at a higher rate on savings. As the Conservative party reformed the tax system and lowered taxes, however, it removed the surcharge, and the clause continues that process.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Oxford, East will enlighten me because I was a little confused about one of his points. He reviewed the different tax treatments of different savings, which undeniably exist. Was he, however, proposing that taxes should go up or down? He complained about a lack of clarity in some of the Government's proposals, but I was totally unclear about his.<br><br>
I want to save members of the Committee any confusion about what the 20 per cent. savings tax covers. The income would include interest that is paid by banks, building societies and by other financial institutions and companies; interest distributions from authorised unit trusts; income from purchased life annuities and from gilts, corporate bonds and other securities; discounts for example on discounted securities; dividends, which are obviously already taxed in that way; and any equivalent income that is received from overseas. We thought hard to ensure that the proposal encapsulated what people usually regard as savings.<br><br>
New clause 7 requires us to provide information about savings vehicles. The Inland Revenue, however, already publishes a range of leaflets on the tax treatment of all types of savings vehicles, which have been updated to provide taxpayers with detailed information from a Revenue perspective. I do not want to suggest that the Government shirk their responsibility, but we live in the world of the family money page and of advice programmes, such as "Money Box Live" on the radio. Much lay information, which is even easier to understand, therefore backs up and exemplifies the contents of official publications. I shall, however, note carefully what the hon. Gentleman has said, as it is important that people understand that there are differences in savings vehicles.<br><br>
In addition, both the Inland Revenue statistics and economics office and the Treasury regularly publish details of amounts invested and held in various savings vehicles, including pensions. There is no shortage of publicly available information on the subject, and to a degree that renders the terms of new clause 7 redundant.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked, first, whether we, the Government, have a strategy behind what we are doing. The Budget's whole strategy is to make progress towards a tax rate of 20 per cent. We have done that by enlarging the band of earnings taxed at 20 per cent., by reducing the basic rate of tax to 24 per cent.—that is a further step on the way to 20 per cent.—and by taxing savings at 20p in the pound. That is a clear strategy: we published it in our manifesto and we continue to support it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East said that there are less sophisticated investors for whom building society
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0375">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
accounts are very important. We have helped them with the lower tax on savings. Other people wish to make a longer commitment using the building society mechanism so we have developed TESSAs. For those who want a more sophisticated but again long-term tax beneficial way to save, we have PEPs. In the longest term, we maintain the considerable tax advantage for those who, rightly, choose to invest in their own pensions.<br><br>
That illustrates a clear strategy of maintaining advantage for those who wish to put money by for their rainy day whenever that may come, with suitable tax advantages. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington seeks to take that further and simplify that process. I shall reflect carefully on what he had to say in that context.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked a number of questions. I hope that I can satisfy him on them, but I shall be happy to write to him with further details if necessary. He mentioned the difference in the regime's treatment of annuities and purchased life annuities. Some annuities are in the form of a pension. It would not be fair to tax them at the lower rate when other pensions are taxed at the basic rate. Other annuities such as those paid by a trust are not what most people would regard as savings income.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked other questions, more relevant to future debates on the schedule to this clause, that dealt with problems on which the life insurance companies have written to all hon. Members to identify. The hon. Gentleman will find comfort in what I have to say about the Government's proposed clarificatory amendments to schedule 5 and in the response that I can give to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. No doubt my hon. Friend will wish to move his own new clauses, but what I have to say may help him also. The fundamental point concerns the different rates at which insurance companies with pension business and other businesses are dealt with under the proposal for the 20 per cent. tax. As I said, I think that we can deal with that matter satisfactorily later.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked me some very specific questions as a result of representations from the Law Society of Scotland. Section 118 of the Finance Act 1993 ensures that beneficiaries of liferent trusts get the benefit of 20 per cent. in the same way as beneficiaries of English interest in possession trusts. The Inland Revenue has already given assurances to that effect. The beneficiaries of discretionary trusts do not, however, get the benefit of the 20 per cent. rate. They receive their savings in annual payments and not in income. Annual payments are not included in income to which the 20 per cent. rate applies, and they are not what most people regard as savings. I hope that those two points cover the issues raised by the Law Society of Scotland, but I give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking to write to him or to the Law Society should further clarification be required.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked how the lower rate would apply to covenants. That takes us into the territory of new clause 8. At the heart of his argument is the fact that some people who make payments to charities under covenants may become
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
lower rate taxpayers as a result of the Budget changes and the basic rate of tax deducted from their covenanted payments will not be matched by basic rate tax paid on their income. That problem arises already and is not created by the application of the 20 per cent. rate of savings. It may comfort the hon. Gentleman to know that statutory rules and operational procedures already deal with that issue. As only a small minority of lower rate taxpayers have charitable covenants, it is not a major problem. The Opposition may have expressed this view because they thought that the provision created an additional complication. I hope that I have put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest, because that is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the attention that he has given to my specific points. He says that this provision will not be a major problem for charitable covenants. Does he accept that the person who is making covenanted payments and whose income is taxed at the 20 per cent. rate will have to meet an additional tax demand from the Revenue for the difference, all other things being equal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to deal with that point in more detail, because I knew that it troubled the hon. Gentleman. That is why I referred to the procedures that deal with that problem. I emphasise that the use of those procedures depends on the circumstances under which they arise. To ease the problem that the hon. Gentleman described of an outstanding tax liability caused by the interaction between the lower rate of tax and someone's covenanted giving, the Revenue could apply a coding adjustment under pay-as-you-earn. Outstanding tax could also be offset against any repayment due. The shortfall could be dealt with in the taxpayers' annual return. Moreover, a tax inspector could exercise his discretion not to recover the tax if the amount involved were very small and occurred in only one year.<br><br>
By providing such detail, I hope that I have shown the hon. Gentleman that there is an understanding of the problem, especially when relatively small sums are involved, and that, given the procedures that I have outlined, the taxpayer need not be troubled. These problems are not new: clear precedents exist that show how the problems can be overcome. In the light of my remarks I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press new clause 8 to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is relatively little to which I can respond. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington for his remarks. I shall take his proposals as a contribution to our consultations on lifetime savings. The Minister wanted more details on that. We are getting some interesting proposals, and we shall publish the conclusions of our consultation process when we are ready to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman yet in a position to answer the simple question that I ran past him? Does he envisage tax relief being available on the way into the fund, in the fund and on the way out of the fund?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, we certainly envisage the relief accumulating within the fund, but we would consider the other possibilities. A long-term fund needs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
some incentive built into it to encourage a person to stay in it. That would have to be a design feature of the system.<br><br>
When I drew attention to the variety of rates and treatments of taxation on capital in, on entry into and exit from various savings vehicles, the Financial Secretary asked whether I sought higher taxation or lower taxation. Of course, we do not want taxation on savings to be any higher than necessary. We want to reduce it. That is why we support clause 65.<br><br>
I raised the issue in a spirit of fiscal neutrality, to encourage the Committee and future Committees as well as the Government and future Governments to focus on the question of how far incremental changes to the system lead to a consistent and equitable framework for the taxation of savings and related vehicles overall. A process of cumulative ad hoc arrangements adds to what I have described as the fiscal undergrowth. That creates perverse incentives or disincentives, makes the issue much more complicated for savers and adds to the compliance costs. The value of new clause 7 is that it would keep the issue in front of the public and Parliament so we can ensure that reform makes the system more consistent, simpler and easier to understand, rather than the opposite.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary gave me various undertakings on new clause 8. I will be interested to see how the procedures for dealing with that work in practice, but I am prepared to wait and see. On that basis, I will withdraw new clause 8. For the reasons I have given, however, I want to press new clause 7 to a vote. I understand that we will come to that in a couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. The withdrawal of new clause 8 will be dealt with when we get there, too, and not this afternoon.</span></p>

TAXATION OF SAVINGS AT THE LOWER RATE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 195, line 35, leave out from "of" to end of line 39 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"the company's BLAGAB profits for any accounting period".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 91 to 98.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to the part of the schedule that sets out how the income of a life insurance company is taxed where it receives income of the type that for an individual is savings income. In general terms, the part of its income that is accumulated for the benefit of policy holders and which represents savings income is charged at the same rate of corporation tax, namely, 20 per cent. Obviously, that is the same as the rate of income tax that applies to savings income.<br><br>
It became apparent from comments by the insurance industry that the wording of the paragraph was open to misinterpretation. The benefit of consultation is that our amendments clarify the wording so that it will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
absolutely plain how the division of the company's income is carried out.<br><br>
As I said a moment ago, I hope that it will be convenient for the Committee if I say now that the Government are sympathetic to the thrust of the other amendments to this part of the schedule. They have been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and they address the same problem of drafting as the Government amendments. However, they go further and would change the way in which the proportion of a life insurance company's income that is charged at 20 per cent. is calculated. I am sure that my hon. Friend will wish to contribute to the debate in his usual lucid style, but I thought that it might help him to know that I am positively inclined towards his amendment.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
However, my hon. Friend's amendments are not quite right technically. The Government's intention would be to return on Report with further amendments that meet my hon. Friend's requirements. Technically speaking, the proposals are linked and, having examined the representation from the Association of British Insurers, I can understand why my hon. Friend might seek to pursue the Government amendments with his own.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a little premature. We are not quite at the point of dealing with the amendments in the name of the hon.

yet moved. [Hon. Members: "Don't spoil it."] Exactly, I do not think I will spoil it: I see no need to speak at length to the amendment, as my hon. Friend the Minister has said already that he considers it good in principle.<br><br>
Suffice it to say that a special rate of tax on savings income should, as far as possible, apply to all savings income, whether that income accrues to an individual or inside a collective investment scheme. We are talking about life assurance policies. The Association of British Insurers says that, in certain limited circumstances, policy holders cannot take the benefit of the 20 per cent. rate. I shall not weary the Committee with the technical details, Mr. Hogg, although you might like to hear about BLAGAB. That splendid piece of jargon stands for the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"basic life and general annuity business".</p></blockquote>
I hope that that helps the Committee. The ABI states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The method of attribution and apportionment followed in the Notes on Clauses example"—</p></blockquote>
I gather that an example is given as an aid in the notes on clauses—
<br><blockquote><p>"means that only 24 per cent. of the policyholders' BLAGAB income and gains ends up being taxed at the 20 per cent. lower rate. The rest is taxed at the basic rate."</p></blockquote>
That is the nub of the problem to which my hon. Friend has already given such a helpful reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I conclude from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he is withdrawing the amendment.</span></p>

PERSONAL ALLOWANCES FOR 1996–97</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 44, line 25, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In section 259(1) of that Act there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'(d) any woman who for the whole or part of the year is married to and living with a husband who is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity throughout the year.'."</p></blockquote>
The problem to which the amendment refers was drawn to my attention by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock). One of her constituents was caught by an anomaly in the current system that even the Government acknowledge to be unsatisfactory. Currently, when a wife is incapacitated or disabled and the couple have one or more children, the husband can claim an additional personal allowance of £1,720 a year—additional to the married couple's allowance. Both allowances are provided at 15 per cent. income tax relief; both are being increased to £1,790 in the current Budget.<br><br>
The amendment would end the blatant discrimination which is purely sexist in not treating equally the rights of men and women in those circumstances. As my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch discovered to her horror when her constituent came to see her, the allowance is available to working men who have an incapacitated or disabled wife but is unavailable to a working wife who has a disabled husband. I am sure that the Committee will acknowledge that in the 1990s that amounts to sheer discrimination. If the constituent were to take the issue to the European Court, it could well result in a decision against the Government on grounds of discrimination between the sexes.<br><br>
Some publicity was given to this case. I have with me a cutting from the <i>Evening Echo, Bournemouth</i> which explains what happened to Mrs. MacGregor, my hon. Friend's constituent, who is a part-time veterinary assistant. Her husband is severely disabled. The couple have been married since December 1994, although they have a four-year-old son. If the sexes were reversed, the allowance would be paid.<br><br>
The Minister's odd response acknowledges the problem. In a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, the Financial Secretary said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise that the provision may well be regarded as anachronistic."</p></blockquote>
Apparently, the reasoning behind this state of affairs is that men expect housekeepers when they get married. That used to be regarded as an entirely acceptable reason for marriage. Women who get married are supposedly not expecting housekeepers so they are not entitled to qualify for the allowance.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
discrimination. I am pointing out the reasoning that underpinned the justification for current arrangements, which are sexist and anachronistic, to use the words of the Financial Secretary. The Minister also wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed the housekeeper allowance and some other minor allowances were abolished in 1988 largely because they were out of tune with modern society. At the time we considered whether this aspect of the additional personal allowance should also be abolished since its main purpose has in any case been largely superseded by the development of the social security system which we regard as a better vehicle than tax reliefs for delivering cash assistance to those with special needs."</p></blockquote>
Yes, but if they do not gain tax reliefs either, they are worse off if the benefits do not apply. The Minister continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"We decided that on balance the provision should be retained, at least for the time being. However, because the provision was recognised to be out of date we decided not to extend it to women with incapacitated husbands. This remains our view although we recognise that it is not a wholly satisfactory state of affairs."</p></blockquote>
Hallelujah to that—it certainly is not a satisfactory state of affairs. I am a little concerned that if I press the matter, the Minister might simply withdraw the benefit currently available to men. Indeed, he has hinted as much, but I hope that he will not be so uncharitable or so unkind.<br><br>
Perhaps I could also give some encouragement to Labour Members who are a little hesitant about supporting amendments that might cost money. It is estimated that, across the board, about 9,000 women might qualify.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not hesitant at all. We are very determined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very encouraging; this could be my lucky day. The cost is estimated at £2.32 million, which I suspect is £2.3199 recurring too much for new Labour to be able to cope with. I should point out that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) has supported the amendment. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have already expressed to Sir George Young my anger at what is a gross discrimination against women. And I will raise the matter again".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady said that before new Labour was in full flow—that quote is from <i>Today,</i> which, alas, is no longer with us. The hon. Lady made her comments last year; nevertheless, I would have thought that as she was not a hundred miles from the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East, she could have discussed the matter with him.<br><br>
The serious point is that there are genuine cases of people in real financial difficulties who are incensed that they are denied a benefit that would be made available to them were the position reversed. I have one or two further examples which have been drawn to my attention:
<br><blockquote><p>"Susan has been caring for her husband for two years since an accident at work left him permanently disabled. Susan and her husband have two children—Jamie aged 12 and John 13.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Susan manages to hold down a job as a sports instructor at the local sports centre. She estimates that over a quarter of her wages is spent on buying in care. She has had to reduce her hours of work to fit in with her caring responsibilities. She estimates the resulting annual loss of income as being around £3,500. Susan says her mind is often
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
on her responsibilities at home whilst trying to work—she says she tries to switch off but it's not easy."</p></blockquote>
I also have the details of the case of Julie, who has
<br><blockquote><p>"cared for her husband who suffers from severe Multiple Sclerosis for the last 15 years. She says it's a struggle to pay the mortgage and support the family which includes her daughter Sally aged 16. Julie has a teaching qualification which she says is now under used because of her caring responsibilities. She manages to do part-time teaching work."</p></blockquote>
Of course, Mr. Hogg, you understand that, by definition, to qualify for the benefit, people would have to have some work and income to offset the tax allowance. Julie says that she has to work and says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite all her stress and difficulties, financially, physically and mentally, she constantly worries about putting her husband's interests first."</p></blockquote>
The third case concerns Sandra,
<br><blockquote><p>"a Social Work lecturer who has been caring for her husband for around 18 months. She has had to reduce her hours of work and change her hours to fit in with her husband's needs. She says her career must now be based around her caring. Sandra's daughter Sophie is three years old. Sandra pays for a child minder for Sophie so that she can go out to work. Sandra estimates she has had to take off nearly 2 months from work in the last year alone and has come close to giving up work altogether because of the physical and financial strain."</p></blockquote>
Those examples illustrate real cases of real people in real difficulties because the Government are not prepared to extend the benefit to include women.<br><br>
I press the Minister to give some consideration to the matter. He resisted my earlier amendment. This one would cost less than a quarter of what this morning's amendment would have cost and will provide real assistance for people who provide a caring role because of their devotion to their partners and who go to work in order to reduce the burden on the state. Were they not working, they would be entitled to benefits.<br><br>
A point of principle is involved: surely the state should not be seen to exploit people who struggle to look after people who are dependent on them and so reduce the call for benefits and assistance that might otherwise cost the taxpayer. By resisting the amendment, the Minister could create greater costs than savings. If women such as those whom I have mentioned are under such pressure that they can no longer work, the family unit would be forced to depend on state benefits and charity to continue caring. An estimate of £2.32 million suggests that the amendment is not beyond the capacity of a Government who recognise the contribution that carers make and seek to provide equal and fair treatment.<br><br>
Does the Minister have advice on the legal implications of the discrimination? The test would be for somebody to take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights to determine whether the Bill is discriminatory. It appears to be.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is clearly a serious anomaly, which we should tackle, in the amendment. Why have the Government not done so already? The current allowance is discriminatory. It was introduced in 1960 by the then Chancellor, Derick Heathcoat-Amory—but let not the sins of the fathers be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0379">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
visited on the heirs or nephews. It was intended to enable a husband with an incapacitated wife to employ a housekeeper—the assumption was that he could not do housework himself. It was, however, assumed that a wife with an incapacitated husband could do the housework, presumably in the belief that she would not work or that, if she did, she would do the housework too.<br><br>
The allowance is clearly based on outdated and wrong assumptions. It is discriminatory, and the Labour party opposes that. We therefore tabled amendments to it during consideration of two previous Finance Bills. We did not press our amendment to a vote during the 1991 Bill because a Minister, who has since entered the Cabinet, promised that she would consider the matter. Her reply to the amendment was interesting. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The difference in tax treatment has long been a feature of the tax system; in its present form, it dates from 1960. No doubt, it reflects a view from those days that it was usual for a wife to look after a home and bring up children. Therefore, when a mother was incapacitated, a case was seen for additional help; that did not seem appropriate when the husband was incapacitated."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 20 June 1991; c. 479.]</p></blockquote>
In 1988, the Prime Minister—then Chief Secretary to the Treasury—persuasively suggested that the allowance was an anachronism. He argued:
<br><blockquote><p>"it has been accepted on both sides of the House in recent years that the best way of helping to support elderly or infirm people is not through the tax system but through the social security system."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 24 May 1988; c. 228.]</p></blockquote>
Labour raised the issue again during consideration of the 1992 Bill because the Government had done nothing about the anomaly. The then Financial Secretary—who also subsequently entered the Cabinet—said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is not right to seek to mould the tax system to help small groups of people in the way that the additional personal allowance does for men and the amendment would do for women … We believe that the way to help the disabled is not through the tax system, but by targeted social security benefits."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 1 July 1992; c. 516–517.]</p></blockquote>
Again, however, the Government showed no inclination to change the system and offer financial assistance through social security.<br><br>
There is a certain logic in the Government's proposal to help families through the social security system. I therefore seek an undertaking from the Minister that he will propose means in the coming year to implement measures that the current Prime Minister proposed in 1988 and which two current Members of the Cabinet proposed in Committee.<br><br>
While the present system is anomalous and discriminatory, Opposition Members question whether the amendment is a move in the right direction. There is no clear relationship between a disabled spouse and the household income. The social security system might be better able to adjust that. There is a danger that the amendment, by accepting the tax system as a means of ending this discrimination, would result in resources not being targeted as well as they could be. After all, as the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said, it would benefit those able to work, but not those who are unable to work.<br><br>
As the Government have suggested, there may be a better way of targeting that benefit on those who would gain most from it. The Labour party believes that the tax and benefit system should be centred on and give direct help to disabled people. We would be giving out the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
wrong signals if we introduced changes in the Finance Bill that assisted spouses of disabled people. That also smacks of paternalism. It would be better and would more directly help disabled people if the Government targeted similar resources at resolving two problems: the underfunding this year of the access to work scheme, which has caused it to be suspended until April for many people, and the treatment for VAT purposes of computer equipment bought by disabled people.<br><br>
I want to associate myself and the Labour party with the Liberal Democrats in so far as they condemn discrimination. The Government have a responsibility to deal with discrimination urgently, but they must deal with it properly. I am not convinced that the amendment deals with the issue as effectively as possible, so I regret that I am unable to support it. If the law were amended in this way, it would create new losers, particularly if a change were later to deal with the issues through the social security system.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will give an undertaking to review this discriminatory allowance and to try to find a more effective way forward as a matter of urgency, bearing in mind that the Prime Minister wants the anomaly dealt with and previous Financial Secretaries have said that they intended to deal with it. Here we are, some years later, back where we started with the Government still not coming forward with proposals to deal with what we all agree is a discriminatory allowance that is unsustainable in the long-term. It is up to the Minister to propose a reasoned and clear way forward to deal with this discrimination, and during the next year to introduce legislative proposals to put in place a system that will properly benefit those whom we all believe should be benefited.<br><br>
In the meantime, the Labour party will make proposals in due course to deal with this issue. If there is a general election in the next few months, we may be able to do something effective about it, given the time that we will have to consider the next Finance Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's undertaking to produce a specific proposal. That would be a welcome change from the way in which the Labour party has so far conducted its affairs. He researched carefully and accurately the reasons why this allowance was introduced. In 1960, before independent taxation was introduced, those who would have qualified for the old housekeepers' allowance would have qualified for this benefit. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, it was designed to assist those who single-handedly had the responsibility for children and an incapacitated wife. I note that the matter has been discussed in previous Finance Bill debates. I hope that what I am about to say does not seem hard hearted.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gordon presented the amendment carefully. He brought to the Committee's attention some real world examples of how this anomaly affects real people. He put his views forward with care and compassion: he almost touched the hearts of some of us. Before I buckled to his approaches, I decided to look again at the way in which the matter had been dealt with by Committees considering previous Finance Bills. I ought to draw the attention of members of the Committee to the words used by my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Dorrell) when he was the Financial Secretary. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If we were starting from scratch today, we certainly would not invent an allowance that went only to mem but, equally, I do not believe we would invent an allowance at all. Nor do I believe that a tax allowance, by any definition, is an efficient way of helping that relatively small group of people".</p></blockquote>
I can find no better way of summing up the situation that still persists today.<br><br>
No one walks away from the fact that the situation is anomalous, but I resist what the hon. Member for Gordon said. He tempted me to make a public expenditure saving of £3 million when he hinted that one of the thoughts that might have been in our mind was to abolish the allowance, thus removing the anomaly simply and effectively. However, it was argued that it would not be right to remove it, because some 10,000 husbands obtained help from it. We were certainly not minded to make their life more difficult by removing it.<br><br>
It is worth reflecting on the alternative situation. In contrast to the tax position, social security benefits—as the hon. Members for Gordon and for North Warwickshire pointed out—are more widely available to men and women who are disabled and who have disabled partners. A couple of which only one partner was totally incapacitated and met the strict tests of the additional personal allowance may, under those circumstances, be entitled to several social security benefits, including disability living allowance and invalid car allowance, which could amount in total to £6,000 a year at current levels, regardless of their other income. That is an important point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire said that he was seeking a way forward and assurances from me. He will understand that I am not in a position to give either undertakings or assurances on behalf of other Ministers. However, because the issue is of concern to the hon. Members for Gordon and for North Warwickshire, I will undertake to draw the attention of the Secretary of State for Social Security to the comments that have been made. Equally, I hope that they will weigh carefully what I have said. Somebody in the circumstances to which the allowance applies could benefit significantly from the social security system in the way that I described and, most importantly, regardless of their income. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security said, this is an anomaly but he felt, as I do, that the social security system is the best way in which to handle the matter. I invite my hon. Friends to leave the matter as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary is trying to be helpful. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) seems to be engaged in do-it-yourself. He is just a trifle noisy. I am sure that he can shuffle his papers without emulating claps of thunder.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary is trying to be helpful. Perhaps he might go a little further. We want
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
the Government to do what they promised to do—undertake a thorough review of the issue. That will need to be performed by the Treasury and the Department of Social Security. He agreed that at least his Department—perhaps he could request the same of the Secretary of State for Social Security—would write to members of the Committee in due course, when that review has been undertaken, to say how the Government propose to deal with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I got into trouble because of my body language in the Chamber so to avoid doubt, I had better make it entirely clear what I said I would do. I said, in a spirit of helpfulness, that I would draw the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security to the remarks of the hon. Members for North Warwickshire and for Gordon. I can do no more than alert him to the concerns that have been expressed. How my right hon. Friend takes the matter forward is entirely a matter for him. I have outlined my reasons for wanting the Committee to resist this amendment. I rest my case.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his constructive approach, but I am a little disappointed. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire has reminded the Committee that the matter has been raised for several years consecutively. The same exchange of views has taken place each time, yet nothing has been done. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch is relatively new to the House, having come here after a by-election. She has not had the opportunity to serve on this Committee yet, but she has been confronted by a problem in her constituency about which she feels strongly. The 8,000 or 9,000 people affected are struggling with the day-to-day reality.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire says that he sees that the Government have a point and that the social security system may be the proper answer. The Financial Secretary says that it is not his responsibility but that he will draw the matter to the attention of the Secretary of State for Social Security. That is exactly what has happened over the past several years, whenever the matter has been raised. With the greatest respect to him, the Secretary of State for Social Security has not thought it necessary to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said during my remarks that the social security system may represent a better way of dealing with the matter than the tax system, for the reasons that I outlined. If the amendment were carried, does not the hon. Gentleman accept that a new set of losers would be created?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see that simply extending the tax relief to married women in the context of the amendment would create a new set of losers. It would provide them with relief. I do not quite understand the hon. Gentleman's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government and, to an extent, the Labour party have suggested that the social security system is a better way of delivering the benefit. Let us suppose that the hon. Gentleman's proposal to extend the benefit to women was accepted, but that it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
subsequently decided that the social security system offered a better way of dealing with the problem. As a result, if the benefit were withdrawn from the tax system—with the costs transferred to the social security system—the women who would have benefited under the amendment would lose. In that way, would not the amendment create a new set of losers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the hon. Gentleman's point. He is saying that if my amendment is not accepted, switching from a tax relief to a benefit system would cause there to be losers among the men who currently get tax relief. In addition, if the numbers were to be doubled by extending the proposal to women, the number of losers could be doubled if an alternative system were to be introduced. That is true, but I am not confident anyone is about to grasp the nettle. In the meantime, 9,000 working women with disabled husbands are losing. They have been told for several years that the solution is to amend the social security system, but no such amendment has been forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the amendment create discrimination against people who live together without being married? That happens quite a lot these days, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Should not the amendment take that into account?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting a little puzzled, and more than a little niggled, at the Labour party's excuses for not supporting simple and constructive changes to the Bill. The reality is that a simple amendment has been tabled to deal with a simple anomaly. Nothing is perfect in this world—certainly, Labour amendments are not perfect, even when they deal with an issue in detail.<br><br>
I felt that it would be constructive to press the Government to do more than simply say that they acknowledged that there was an anomaly—I wanted them to do something about it. The Financial Secretary acknowledged that the situation was anomalous and that something ought to be done, but I did not sense that he would leave the Committee with fire in his heart to persuade his colleagues that the nettle should be grasped this time. If I could be persuaded that that was his intention, I would withdraw the amendment. I am sorry that the Labour party finds the amendment too radical and far reaching, but if the Minister is unable to make that assurance, I shall press it to a division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was putting the question, but the hon. Gentleman stood up. He has a long track record of making speeches, and I should hate to disappoint him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not really delivering my own speech, although it will come from my mouth. My right hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Alison) represents the Church Commissioners in the House of Commons and has an interest in the married couples allowance. I am sympathetic to that and hoped, therefore, to make a couple of points on an issue that especially concerns the Church—indeed, Christian Action Research and Education prepared an extensive brief on it.<br><br>
Before I continue, I have a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I tabled an amendment, but it has not appeared on the amendment paper. Was it out of order or was it not handed in on time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has not been tabled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that useful piece of intelligence.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Selby handed me an amendment which he had started to formulate. The gist of it is that although many people who have been concerned about the married couple's allowance for some years are delighted that there has been a modest increase this year, there is an argument that the allowance should be raised to about £2,000. That would certainly be a reasonable level, given the limitations put on the allowance during the recession when it was difficult to raise allowances by the normal rates.<br><br>
In the past, several arguments were advanced against putting too much emphasis on the married couple's allowance. Those arguments covered the fact that the allowance is sometimes considered as an anomaly since the introduction of independent taxation, although independent taxation is about how couples should be taxed, not about the weight of the tax that they should bear as couples.<br><br>
It has also been alleged that the tax system penalises marriage. I declare an interest in that my wife and I are a married coupled who benefit from the allowance—sometimes one feels, as part of a married couple, that the tax system is especially onerous on people who take on all the responsibilities of marriage. One would slightly question those who claim that married couples do not benefit from the allowance as well as those who argue that people get married because of the tax allowances. That might well be the case, but it is not uppermost in people's minds.<br><br>
If we consider marriage to be worth encouraging, the tax system is a legitimate mechanism to do that. I would argue that it is worth using the tax-system in that way until such time as we move over to a flat-rate tax, but I shall not revisit the earlier argument. I see no inconsistency between my earlier argument that we might move towards a flat-rate tax, and my support of an allowance that might move against such a tax. Since

we are not moving towards a flat-rate allowance, it makes sense to contemplate why the allowance exists and perhaps to argue that it should continue to increase on an index basis as an absolute minimum.<br><br>
I would further argue that there is a need to focus on benefiting those people who are prepared to go through the marriage ceremony for the benefit not only of themselves and their spouses but for any children who might result from that marriage. There is too much emphasis in the system on cohabitation being sufficient. It is not necessarily sufficient in the interests of children.<br><br>
It is about time that the tax system which, once upon a time, recognised children in a more focused manner through child allowances, moved back just a little towards recognising the interests of children. Regular indexing of the married couple's allowance would certainly benefit children by moving the focus back towards children, who are disadvantaged if the tax system does not differentiate between those people who are prepared to make a commitment through a marriage ceremony and those who simply cohabit, and then find it that much easier to break up if the relationship comes under pressure. As all of us know, married life can involve many pressures. If one is committed through marriage, one might be more committed to getting over those pressures in the interests of any children who might be a part of the marriage. Just living together might not be just the same.<br><br>
On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Member for Selby, I conclude his speech which has come out of my mouth on his behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was very worried to follow in the footsteps of the hon. Member for Dover for fear that I would agree with almost everything he said. Luckily, he made a speech for the right hon. Member for Selby, with whom I feel more in communion.<br><br>
I am glad, so to speak, that the point has been raised. The question of supporting marriage will become—it already exists in other legislation—a subject to which hon. Members will have to pay attention. We are not an especially marriage-friendly society. The number of divorces, single parents and children born out of wedlock has skyrocketed in the past 16 years. I am not making a party political point because the underlying trend was well established.<br><br>
The Paymaster General, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury—he is not with us, presumably having more pressing material to read between now and Thursday—and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield were all at Oxford in the 1960s. That period was riotous in its morality and decadent in its thought. Many members of the Government are products of that "anything goes", "me first", era.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The Conservative Government have been tough on the family and tough on the causes of the family. Other taxation regimes around the world—such as the United States, supposedly a more market-oriented, capitalist economy—provide greater support to the family through taxation. Certainly, praying in aid the European
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
example is not popular these days with those on the Conservative Benches, but support for the family through the tax regime is much stronger on the European continent. As a result, family life with all its stresses and strains is more stable.<br><br>
I shall provide some concrete figures. In 1964, a married couple with a single earner on average earnings with two children aged under 11 paid 8 per cent. of their income in income tax. Today, even allowing for the switch to child tax allowance, the figure is 22 per cent. In other debates on the Floor of the House, I have stressed the need not to abandon support of families in which only one person is the earner. Personally, I do not care whether the male or female is the earner.<br><br>
The constant drive to ensure stable family life for those who are not in receipt of handsome incomes by basing it on both parents' earnings has serious consequences, especially for the future citizens of the world, our children. I well remember the debate in the 1970s when child allowances were first posited as an alternative to the marriage allowance. I argued that case at the time. We now need to move away from viewing the issue in either/or terms: the direct transfer benefit and the tax allowance should be complementary. We want money put into mothers' purses to help them look after their children, not just a tax allowance for male earners that might not get into mothers' hands. That should not, however, be used as a reason to reduce the married couple's allowance to the extent that it becomes almost nugatory.<br><br>
The Prime Minister said in November:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Government believe that married couples should receive recognition in the tax system."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 6 November 1995; Vol. 265, c. 547–8.]</p></blockquote>
The small increase being proposed in the Bill would add at best about 20p a week—hardly a recognition that has any real meaning. On the other hand, in 1993 the Chancellor described the married couple's allowance as
<br><blockquote><p>"a bit of an anomaly".</p></blockquote>
Once again we hear the Chancellor saying one thing and see the Prime Minister doing another, or vice versa. It would be helpful to the government of this country and the direction of fiscal policy if the right hon. Gentleman and the right hon. and learned Gentleman could get their act together.<br><br>
The issue needs to be examined again in detail, perhaps during consideration of the next Finance Bill. For what it is worth, I give notice to my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench that other hon. Members and I intend to pursue the matter. There is a case for levelling up the tax advantages of a married couple and of those who cohabit.<br><br>
I fully recognise that cohabitation is now a perfectly proper and normal way for men and women to live together and to bring up children. That is recognised by other countries' tax regimes. In France it is called concubinage, which is exactly the same word in English. I see the hon. Member for Beaconsfield rattling his desk looking for a French dictionary. Concubinage—living together—is recognised under continental European tax systems. When a couple declare themselves to be in that state of non-married togetherness, they have the same tax breaks in terms of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0383">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
inheritance, property transfer and tax that married couples enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bien sûr.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman talking mumbo-jumbo? On the one hand he says that he wants a fiscal incentive for marriage and supports the married couple's allowance, and then he tells us that he also supports people cohabiting and he wants them to have an allowance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not responsible for the hon. Gentleman's mumbo-jumbo but I can tell him that he, too, went to Oxford university because I looked it up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Mr. Hogg, and in roughly the same era as the right hon. Gentlemen whom I mentioned a moment ago. I shared their riotous living and decadent thinking but I have since seen the light.<br><br>
I was actually talking French but I know that for the new Tory party, talking any foreign language is the equivalent of mumbo-jumbo now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fermez la bouche.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield's years at Oxford were not wasted and that he can remember some French.<br><br>
As a result of changes in allowances since 1990, including those that are proposed in the Finance Bill, the annual tax bill of a married couple with one earner will have gone down by £42 since then, while that of a cohabiting couple with two earners and no children will have gone down by £365. Again, I point out that, whether or not it is intentional, ours is not a family-friendly Government. They are not a friendly Government in any sense.<br><br>
I welcomed the intervention of the right hon. Member for Selby. Although his words traversed the lips of the hon. Member for Dover, he made powerful and valid points and I urge both Front Benches to consider again the need to make Treasury policy more supportive of and friendly to married life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not go to Oxford university but I hope that that does not debar me from the debate.<br><br>
I do not want to enter the moral arguments about marriage and cohabitation but I will make two brief points. The tax system ought to help families but the reality is that, as my hon. Friend said, it has had exactly the opposite effect in the past few years. In a crude and imprecise way, the married couple's allowance has helped many families. However, it is a bit rich for the hon. Member for Dover to come here and praise it when this is the first Finance Bill for five or six years that has not mentioned it. Each of those previous Bills said that the size of the married couple's allowance was being frozen. In two or three Finance Bills, it was reduced from 25 per cent. to 15 per cent. The net result is that the value of the allowance is now £269. If it had been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
uprated, as it should have been, it would be worth £523. It has been one of the tax increases by stealth that the Government thought people would not notice.<br><br>
Tied to the married couple's allowance are the widows' bereavement allowance and the additional personal allowance which goes to some people who care for children and who have been married. That has been whittled away as part of the attack on help for families.<br><br>
The clause directly refers to the personal allowance and, while welcoming the increase, we should not let the debate pass without reminding Conservative Members that it was frozen for three years from 1992–93. If the personal allowance had been uprated, it would be worth more than the £3,765 referred to in subsection (2)(a). It would be worth £3,820. Once again, the Government are not even making up for their previous decisions. One of the effects of freezing the tax was to drag more low-paid people into the tax net, which became a work disincentive.<br><br>
Although we should welcome the Government's attempt to make up to some extent for their past errors, we should remember that personal allowances were frozen. As I said this morning, income tax cannot be considered just in germs of the basic tax rate. It must be considered in connection with allowances. It is because of what has happened to allowances that rates of direct taxation have increased.<br><br>
I shall finish by mentioning inheritance tax. If there had been indexation, the allowance would be £112,000. We know that the Budget is increasing it to £200,000. Once again, there is one law for the rich and another for the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should all be grateful to Care for writing a paper that has been circulated to us and which has provoked this short debate. I found the speech of the hon. Member for Dover a little like the curate's egg—I agreed with some bits but not with others. I do not agree that the institution of marriage is reinforced by fiscal measures that encourage people to stay together for financial reasons when in other circumstances, the relationship would have irretrievably broken down.<br><br>
Married couples with children, especially those on low incomes, have suffered worse than any other group under the recent tax regime. For a family with both adults working and on average earnings, the combination of income tax and national insurance in 1978 took 19.8 per cent. of their earnings. Next year, as a result of the Budget, a slightly higher proportion—20 per cent.—of their earnings will be taken. In 1978–79, 20.9 per cent. of the earnings of a married couple on an average wage, with two children, went on income tax and national insurance contributions net of child benefit. Next year that will rise to 21.4 per cent. They will be worse off as a result of the changes to income tax, national insurance contributions and tax thresholds during the past 17 years. The position is more stark for families on lower incomes.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
For the sake of brevity, I shall quote only one further example. A married couple with two children on half of average earnings in 1973–74 paid 4.3 per cent. of their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0384">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
income in income tax and national insurance net of child benefit. By 1978–79 the figure had fallen to 2.4 per cent. and between 1979 and next year it will have risen from 2.4 per cent. to 8.8 per cent. That underlines the point that I made this morning that the only groups that will pay more income tax and national insurance as a result of this year's Budget are low income families with and without children. Both groups will be worse off, notwithstanding this year's increase in the married couple's allowance.<br><br>
We need a tax regime that makes the burden of bringing up children, especially in low income families, easier because they have suffered most under the taxes on income regime and national insurance regime under the Conservatives. The tax pressure needs to be eased for those families, whether or not there is a contract of marriage between the two partners—I disagree with the hon. Member for Dover on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Inland Revenue press release dated 28 November, the Government presented themselves as a tax-cutting Government: they said that millions would pay less tax under the Conservative Government, but for several years they had frozen the uprating of the personal and other allowances which amounted to a sneaky tax rise. Most people did not realise that it was a tax rise by another name. The effect of not increasing personal allowances has been outlined by some of my hon. Friends who showed that if it had been indexed during the three years during which it was frozen, families would be a lot better off than they are today. That is typical of the way in which the Government introduced their tax hikes.<br><br>
The 1993 Budget contained the biggest tax hike in British peace-time history. Taken as a whole, the tax changes that were proposed and implemented under the Budget made it the most damaging Budget for the people of Britain. Tax allowances were not uprated in the 1981 Budget. A careful look at the way in which tax allowances were not uprated shows that it was consistent with the way in which the Government have dealt with allowances in recent years. That 1981 Budget was the next largest tax hike in British peace-time history according to the figures from the Library. The 1993 Budget raised the equivalent of £10 billion and the 1981 Budget raised the equivalent of £9.9 billion at 1994–95 prices. Even Denis Healey's largest Budget raised only the equivalent of £7.2 billion at 1994–95 prices. The failure to uprate tax allowances was one of the Government's sneaky ways of damaging families.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is fortunate for the hon. Gentleman that he has finished because I was about to call him to order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are causing many problems in this debate about the family. The contribution of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire was strong in historic content but very weak in suggestions about what on earth his party would do. The speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dover acted as a catalyst to expose some interesting divisions in moral attitudes towards marriage, which were discussed by the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) and by other Opposition Members. Labour Members asked some probing and searching questions of their colleagues who sit on the Front Bench, and it was notable that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire was unable to answer them. The Opposition displayed a paucity of view about that important matter. Perhaps an answer cometh from the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is absolutely magnificent. I have a question for the Minister: he is in the Government and knows the books, so how will he answer the questions that were put by the right hon. Member for Selby and myself?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell my right hon. Friend in a moment or two of the good news that the Budget contains for families. However, I must first respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Dover, who said that the married couple's allowance should be extended to £2,000. He should reflect on the fact that that would cost £300 million.<br><br>
I must say to the hon. Member for Rotherham that the Budget contains good news for all families that are affected by the tax system. I said earlier that if we had maintained and indexed the tax regime that we inherited from the previous Labour Government, more than 1 million more people would be paying tax. Opposition Members should reconsider their critical comments of the present tax regime in the light of that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. We have heard enough from the hon. Member for York; instead, I shall give him some good news.<br><br>
The most common type of family with children consists of two earners, one full time and one part time, with joint earnings of around £25,000 a year. Those families will be better off by £280 a year as a result of changes in the Budget. I am glad that we were able to resume the indexation of the married couple's allowance after a difficult period—it reflects the growing strength of the economy.<br><br>
The status of the family is reviewed by examining the tax system and the full range of other spending policies, including health, education and social services. The Budget deals with tax and spending. Many of its spending policies will be of particular benefit to the family.<br><br>
We have had an interesting debate. My ministerial colleagues and I will reflect carefully on what I acknowledge is a sensitive and important matter. However, the questions about taxation and the family are for the Opposition rather than the Government.</span></p>

BLIND PERSON'S ALLOWANCE</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>(4) Subsection (3) above shall apply for the year 1997–98 and subsequent years of assessment.".</p></blockquote>
In 1991, the blind persons' allowance was substantially increased. It went from £540 up £1,080 as a result of a Government review in which they said that that was the proper level.<br><br>
Earlier, I talked about the Government's sneaky way of dealing with such matters. They held the allowance at £1,080 for four years. That is why we tabled the amendment, which would index the blind persons' allowance in a way that ensures that, in future, the allowance will be specified in the Finance Bill of any year in which the Government try not to uprate the allowance. We would index the allowance in a way that would ensure that blind people's allowances progressively rise. If the Government decide to raise it by more than the retail prices index, they will be able to do so. However, if they decide to do what past Conservative Governments have done in refusing to uprate the allowance, it would have to appear in a Bill so that the public would know.<br><br>
I shall outline what has happened in the past few years, so that hon. Members can see why it is necessary to index the allowance. From 1990–91 to 1993–94, the allowance was £1,080; from 1994 to the present day, it has been £1,200; and the rate proposed now is £1,250. What would have happened had the allowance been indexed from its 1990–91 base? How much have the blind lost as a result of the failure to do that? We are talking about the way in which some of society's more vulnerable members are paying the price of the Government's economic failure—their failure to run the economy in a way that would have allowed them to improve progressively the tax allowance for the blind. The Government were willing to make the blind the victims of that failure.<br><br>
If the blind person's allowance had been indexed from the 1990–91 base, it would have risen to £1,550 by 1996–97. As a result of the Government's failure to index properly the blind person's allowance, the blind are less well off to the tune of £300. Let us take a more recent figure—the uprating from 1993–94. If the Government had indexed the allowance at that time, the allowance would have been £1,280 today—a £30 difference.<br><br>
That demonstrates the Government's failure to index properly an allowance for those who are blind. They have allowed the allowance slowly to decrease in value. The Government have been prepared to do that because of their incompetence in running the economy and their failure to ensure that allowances are indexed and brought up to the proper level year on year. In 1990–91, the Government carried out a review and established, rightly, that £1,080 was the proper level, yet they have allowed the real value of the allowance to decline progressively. They should not have done that, especially not by stealth. If the Government had decided to freeze it, they should have ensured that the freeze appeared in that year's Finance Bill so that everyone would know precisely what they were doing.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
If we get the amendment through, any future Government who plan to treat the blind in that way will have to include a clause in the Finance Bill of that year to allow everyone to see what they are doing. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee as a way both of assisting blind people, and of ensuring that there is openness and candour in Government on matters of taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us when the allowance was first introduced? It is important that the Committee should know that. How many people now qualify for it? What would be its real level if it had been preserved at what it was when it was introduced? Those questions are relevant to a better understanding of a clause that I support. I calculate that this year's increase is 4.16 per cent., which is ahead of the rate of inflation.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman asking for the figure from 1990–91 when the Government set it at the level that they said it should be at, or is he looking for another level? In 1981, it was £360. We could go all the way back to the beginning if the hon. Gentleman wants, but we ought to consider the level from 1990–91 when the Government said what it should be set at.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know what the hon. Gentleman said but my question is a little different. I am genuinely interested to know when it was first introduced and to have some answers to my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Warwickshire keeps on talking about sneaky tax increases. Does he remember that indexation was not introduced until 1978? Between 1974 and 1978 we had the worst inflation that this country has ever known and there was no provision for indexation of personal allowances. What is more, when Nigel Lawson proposed that we should have indexation, the Labour Government resisted it and it was forced through only by the courage of two Labour Back Benchers in the Rooker, Wise, Lawson amendment. The Labour Government opposed it, so I do not think that we should take any lectures from the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
As it happens, I have some sympathy with the amendment. As a matter of principle, indexation should be progressed as far as possible into all allowances. However, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, the allowance has in this case been increased by more than the rate of inflation. Nevertheless, there is a case for extending indexation to the allowance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman continuously tells Opposition Members about inflation between 1974 and 1979. Does not he recall that it really took off in about 1972 when his hon. Friends ran the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure that it assists us much to go into the historical origins of inflation or that there is any end to that particular argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a short but interesting debate. I shall respond first to the questions of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington. The blind persons' allowance was originally introduced in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
1962 and if it had been indexed from 1962 to 1996–97 it would be worth about £1,150, slightly less than provided by the clause in which the rate will be £1,250. It is interesting to note that we have made substantial improvements to the allowance, increasing it by almost 70 per cent. in real terms since 1989–90. It is to be increased again to £1,250.<br><br>
We are already being helpful to blind people, and rightly so. Apparently 30,000 blind people get the allowance at a cost of £10 million. Substantial help is being given to blind people through existing arrangements.<br><br>
I have thought carefully about the amendment. There is an underlying logic to the argument that there should be an extension of the statutory indexation provisions to cover the allowance.<br><br>
I am favourable to the hon. Gentleman's arguments, but I have a proviso, which I hope he will accept as a piece of useful information. I am advised that the amendment as drafted would not achieve the result that he seeks. I propose that provision should be made in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
next Finance Bill to make the blind person's allowance subject to statutory indexation, as the hon. Gentleman wants, if he accepts that we shall increase the allowance for the next financial year in the manner proposed in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his positive response to the amendment. We accept the terms that he has set out.<br><br>
Today has been a useful day, with an all-party victory for blind people and a victory for open government and candour in legislation. Indexation allows people to understand what is happening and what Governments decide. That is all to the good. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
