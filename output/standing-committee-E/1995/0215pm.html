However, the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) made an intervention just before lunch that threw me into confusion. In an attempt to clarify matters, he said that the Bill was to do with simplification. He said that the Bill was important for non-quoted businesses and described the difficulties that they faced in negotiating the value of companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about the difficulties non-quoted businesses encounter in negotiating market value, but the Minister appeared to state that the clause deals only with the starting point. Non-quoted businesses are not bothered by the Inland Revenue when they start an unapproved share option scheme. They have to notify the Inland Revenue that an option scheme has been granted under section 136 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, but they do not have to do more than that and the share valuation division does not get involved at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the clause deal with the starting point, as the Minister said, or are the comments about share valuation made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West relevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause ensures that the mere giving up of employee share options by an employee in return for replacement options does not give rise to a capital gain or loss at the time that they are given up. Instead, any gain will be charged, or any loss allowed, when the new option is disposed of for consideration, or when shares obtained by exercising the new option are sold. Like clause 102, it simplifies the capital gains treatment of share options, reduces the need for difficult valuations of options and eliminates tax uncertainties that can arise as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>EXERCISE OF RIGHTS BY EMPLOYEES OF NON-PARTICIPATING COMPANIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the object of the clause is to give greater flexibility to employees. At the present time, an employee who leaves a company mat has set up a scheme and goes to another company that participates in the same scheme gives up his right to exercise savings-related share options. The clause would allow an employee to move about between companies—which I assume must be related, given that the scheme must essentially be the same. If that is the intention, I broadly support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have probed the Government's intentions by an amendment, but it is as easy to do so by means of a stand part debate. The Labour party wholeheartedly endorses the idea of savings-related share option schemes. There are two advantages. First, by definition, a savings-related element implies a fairly long-term commitment. A savings scheme is long-term by definition. An employee would be given the right to buy shares at a fixed price in five or seven years' time. Clearly, one advantage of the scheme is mat it binds the employee into the success of his or her company, which should be applauded. Having the right to buy shares also underlines the employee's vested interest in the company—or at least in the increase in the value of the share, which is normally but not always tied to the success of companies. The long-term share price is usually a good measure of a company's success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that he was in the business of simplifying matters, making share purchase more attractive and encouraging more people to buy them. But have the Government considered simplifying me conditions attached to share option schemes? It is open to a company to make schemes available to anyone who walks in the door. The only constraint imposed by the law is that employees of five or more years' standing must be entitled to take part in me scheme. There is nothing to stop companies from making schemes available as and when people join them. I encourage mat, but we should do more to encourage people to take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
up savings-related share option schemes and to provide more flexibility over the option of buying shares in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be delighted to know that I can provide the source for my statistics. A survey was carried out by the Labour force survey database on the distribution of employees in the United Kingdom in the summer of 19y3. It investigated continuous length of service with present employer and confirmed that just over 25 per cent. of the work force have had continuous service with their employer for less than 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That statistic partly reflects new entrants coming into the labour market: many changes occur as people move in and out of employment. The days of people staying in the same employment between leaving school and retiring with a gold watch 40 years later have come to an end. People increasingly experience different types of employment. That is well known and well documented. Given that a quarter of the work force have been employed for under 18 months, we should consider making savings-related share option schemes more attractive. Have the Government considered removing restrictions and making it more attractive for individuals to take up those options? I want as many employees as possible to take part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The savings element is also crucial. It would be a mistake for employees to rely on their employee-related savings scheme as the sole source of savings. Putting all the eggs in one basket can be risky. I am assuming that employees may have an occupational pension or other outside savings, which should be encouraged. We have some influence over making legislation and should make savings-related share option schemes more attractive. The clause helps in that. Will the Minister clarify, however, what constraints exist? Need it be a related company? Does the scheme have to be the same? What happens when a group contains several different companies all with different schemes—could someone transfer between them or would the clause not help such people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to encourage people to participate in savings-related schemes because they have been fairly successful since their introduction in 1980. The option to buy shares has proved to be popular, and I have some statistics to show that. In 1993–94, nearly half a million employees had share options at an average value of£2,500. That is an impressive statistic, which came from the House of Commons Library—the Minister is nodding, so perhaps the figure came from the Treasury or some other authoritative source. We clearly want to encourage that popularity. Will the Minister tell us what other measures the Government are considering?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to canvass two other points with the Minister. Two further changes to the savings-related schemes were announced at the time of the Budget and they do not require legislation. It would be helpful to people in industry who follow our proceedings—as opposed to those who carry out academic studies on them—if the Minister could talk about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, a new standard savings contract will be published in the spring, and we must be nearing that time now. It would enable employees to save between a
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
minimum of£5—the present minimum is£10—and a maximum £250, as at present. The new contract would allow for a three-year savings period in addition to the current five-year and seven-year periods. That takes me back to my earlier point that we should involve as many people in an enterprise as possible. Some 25 per cent. of the work force are employed for less than 18 months and about 30 per cent. are employed for less than 3 years—those are substantial numbers. The Government are clearly moving in the right direction by reducing the period to three years, but what are the arguments against an 18-month period? It is perhaps not worth the expense, but we should think about it—it would not need legislation, and an announcement has been made. Several questions arise from that. First, can we take it that the announcement in the Budget is being processed and that a further announcement will be made? If so, when? Secondly, do the Government propose to go further? Thirdly, will the Minister confirm that any changes will not affect the existing five and seven-year periods?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a further announcement stated that the intention was to make it possible for savings-related schemes to be operated in conjunction with employee share ownership trusts. Those allow trusts to distribute shares through savings-related, rather than profit-sharing schemes. It would be helpful if the Minister explained the position so that people who want to implement or take advantage of such schemes can discover the Government's intentions. A time scale would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is important. It is popular, and I want it to become more so—that is why I want to make it flexible for people who are employed for as short a period as possible. It is important to remember that if there is going to be such a high turnover in the work force, with people coming in and out of employment, the more opportunity they have to feel that they are tied up with the success of the enterprise, the better. I strongly believe, and those to whom I have spoken who have had practical experience of running medium and large enterprises will agree, that the more someone feels that what they do when they come in in a morning and throughout the day matters, the better the results will be. The major—and difficult—restructurings that have taken place in British industry show that the greater the involvement of employees, the better. We want to encourage that and to consider making those schemes available to people at an early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister will say that people have the option of doing that but that they have to stay with a company. Presumably, because the Government have thought it necessary or desirable to introduce the three-year period, they might move further and make it two years, perhaps, or 18 months. It might be useful for us to discuss that. Employees who have been employed for a longer term are well catered for and do very well. Increasingly, such people are able to make provision for themselves anyway. We would want to encourage that, not only by employee share ownership but through other savings schemes. Many of us are increasingly worried, however, about the people who go in and out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
of employment and do not stay with a company for long. They have problems with their occupational pension as well as with share option schemes. By definition, if one is coming in and out of work, one has problems with saving in general. It must be in the interests of any Government to ensure that we do as much as possible to encourage people to save.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not disagree with the clause, but rather than table endless amendments and prolong the proceedings unnecessarily, it would be useful for the Minister to let us know the Government's thinking. It would be also helpful for companies that want to plan in the long term to see what both sides have to say and their reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get some answers from the Minister about share option schemes. My questions are along the same lines, and asked for the same reasons, as those of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to stress that the Labour party has come a long way since Denis Healey said in 1974 that he was keen to impose
	<br><blockquote><p>"full income tax liability on benefits from all share option and incentive schemes,… including the employee own-as-you-earn scheme as well as the so-called executive schemes."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 March 1974; Vol. 871, c. 317–8.]</p></blockquote>
I remember that that policy shifted during the Lib-Lab pact, when the Labour party agreed with the Liberals of that time that there should be some tax incentive to encourage employees to take up share option schemes if they wanted and if the companies concerned wanted to offer them. In a way, 1979 saw the start of a series of pieces of legislation that promoted that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the mid 1980s the drive towards share option schemes took a turn for the worse. In 1984 Nigel Lawson said that share option schemes were necessary because
	<br><blockquote><p>"we need to do more to attract top calibre company management and to increase the incentives and motivation of existing executives and key personnel by linking their rewards to performance."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 March 1984; Vol. 56, c. 299.]</p></blockquote>
The pressure was then exerted and the incentives doubled to make, as it were, extra incentives to direct the potential of share option schemes in order to boost the characteristics and loyalty of a company, particularly for executives at the top end. I do not want to stray on to the subject of executive share option schemes because it is not relevant. It is significant that the vast majority of the public focuses on the fat cats at the top of major companies that operate share option schemes, even though such schemes have been popular with and taken up by large numbers of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would help to convince Opposition Members that the Government firmly intend to increase the take-up of share option schemes by ordinary workers—I do not like to use that term—by men and women, if they said whether they have undertaken information gathering and research on the salaries and job occupancy of workers in companies that have taken advantage of the schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A year or two ago, share option schemes were opened up to part-time workers. Opposition Members welcomed that, because many workers prefer to work part time. They may have to care for children or elderly
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
parents, but they can still be loyal employees for many years. Even though they work part time, it is their main work. We welcomed the opportunity for those workers to participate in share option schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since that change was made, how many part-time workers have taken up that option? What steps have the Government taken, through their links with industry and the trade unions, to encourage the development of share option schemes for part-time workers? Do the Government, in their heart of hearts, agree that the drift of the pattern of employment and the pattern of labour towards short-term contracts with companies is a bigger disincentive to those employees taking up share options than the shifting around of the fiscal benefits?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that the move towards shorter and more limited contracts underlies much of the insecurity that people feel about their overall financial circumstances. It certainly underlies the insecurity that people feel when they are deciding whether to go in for home ownership. My guess is that it also underlies the insecurity they feel when they consider whether to take up share options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of privatisation, some of the major utilities are under pressure to deliver excellent profits for shareholders: the pressure is on particularly those with the biggest salaries, because they receive the biggest percentage. The pressure to contract out and to out-source the blue collar area of their operations is detrimental to share option schemes. I refer in particular to Yorkshire Water. Last year I made representations to it on its proposal that all the sewerage repair and renovation work in Yorkshire should be transferred from its direct employees to a private company after a competitive bidding process. Is clause 104 partly designed to ensure that, when work is contracted out, employees who transfer to another company are able to take their share option benefits with them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt about the concern felt by people who have been placed in that position, many of whom have 20 years, 30 years or even 40 years loyal service in what they considered to be a public sector company—not a glamorous job, or a job that any member of the Committee would willingly take on this time next week, but a job that is absolutely essential to the public. The employees thought that the prospect would damage their living standards, their pension security and the benefits they received from working in a large, established utility and, more importantly, that it would possibly damage the quality of service delivered, due to the loyalty factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I intervened during the debate on clause 102, I suggested that it was important for the Government to be clear about whether they really wanted to link the tax incentives that they are putting into employee share option schemes with the more general political principles outlined by the Minister to establish company loyalty and so on; or whether the Government's opinion is really more akin to the views in 1984 of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Conservative Members greeted those views with enthusiasm. Perhaps more honestly than some Conservatives, the then Chancellor admitted that the main objective at that time was to ensure that the facility existed at the top level for major companies to offer incentives to the real fat cats. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
really what share options were all about. It would be especially helpful if the Minister would respond to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another issue which makes employees in such circumstances feel a little uncertain: it is not just the imminent threat of their jobs being placed with another company and all the uncertainty that that creates for pensions and so on; it is the attacks that have been made on their organised trade unions during the many years that the Conservatives have been in power. Employees do not consider that, through their organised union structure, they have been encouraged to take the positive, co-operative joint working line with industries to which, as I said before, they have often contributed years of valued work and effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members believe that unless the Government can prove that they want employee share option holders at the lower end of the employee structure to have a significant say in their companies, we have to treat the issue with some scepticism. We will go along with any measures that make a slight improvement, but we must maintain our reservations about whether the Government are really interested in extending such influence at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Save-as-you-earn share option schemes have bedded into the United Kingdom company system. They have had a 15-year track record since being introduced in 1980 and, during that period, they have generally been highly valued by employees, who have benefited from them, and by the companies that use them. Companies operate share option schemes for several reasons. A handful of companies in my constituency operate SAYE share option schemes and, in speaking to me about them, cited the following advantages. They motivate the work force and ensure that the work force have a stake in the future and performance of the company. Companies also believe that the schemes have benefits in terms of employee retention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SAYE share option schemes work because there is clarity in the way they operate. The price is fixed when the option is granted and, depending on how the employer chooses to treat the scheme, there can be an initial gain for the individual because employers are free to set the initial option price at 20 per cent. below the prevailing market rate. I do not disagree with companies that do that for sound reasons, because they want to involve and motivate their employees and ensure that they participate in the success of the company. One substantial benefit of SAYE schemes is that they are open to all employees who want to participate in them. The Opposition have shown strong support for schemes that involve all staff. Such schemes fit in with our views on stakeholding generally and, particularly in respect of stakeholding in companies, it is important that all employees should be allowed to participate, whether they are full time or part time, and wherever they fit into the company hierarchy, although, often, due to company delayering, there are not many layers. Companies must recognise that future
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
competitiveness is built on the fact that all employees contribute to company performance.

The scheme is a relatively modest one. Employees save between£10 and£250 a month in a bank or building society account, usually over a period of five years. They receive a tax-free bonus of nine times the monthly sum saved, so they can build up a lump sum of£17,250 over five years. At the end of that time, they can exercise their option and buy shares with the money in the account, but they do not have to. One of the scheme's benefits is that, if the share price has fallen, there is no compulsion to exercise the option and, instead, the savings can be withdrawn in the form of a tax-free bonus. If the option is exercised on the bonus date and shares are bought, there is no tax to pay. It is therefore unalloyed good news for those who are prudent enough to invest in SAYE share option schemes, and for employees who are fortunate enough to work in companies that operate such schemes. The companies with which I am familiar that operate such schemes run them in tandem with profit-sharing schemes and, often, with what used to be called discretionary share option schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain concerned, however, that many people in this country work in companies that are not able to benefit from the SAYE schemes or from any other schemes. Of the companies in my constituency, 95 per cent. employ fewer than 10 people. The same must be true for other constituencies. Individuals in such companies rarely get the chance to benefit from such schemes as those outlined in this clause and subseqent clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future Finance Bills, we should consider how to reward loyal employees in small companies who do not have the opportunity to participate in such schemes. Those employees probably work harder than those in medium and large-sized companies that operate schemes. They are probably paid less, and they certainly do not get the perks of being able to contribute to a scheme that has the immediate kick-in effect of the right to purchase shares at 20 per cent. below the market rate. Many people must feel hard done by when they look at the Budget and see the new schemes and think, "Why can't I benefit from any of these?" Although I welcome the measures in SAYE schemes, we should also think about those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By relaxing the restriction in schedule 9 of the Taxes Act 1988, the clause allows employees who transfer to an associated company that does not participate in the scheme to exercise their options to acquire shares in the original company at the nominal date. That is extremely welcome, but I am not sure to what extent it will be used. Individuals who work in different parts of a group of companies and who move between different companies within the group are already able to participate in SAYE schemes on the original terms. We are only talking about the limited extent to which it is possible to move from a group company to an associated company of a group. Does the Minister know how many additional people will benefit? I do not know of any cases where individuals who are in schemes are likely to have been excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broader argument is not just to allow this little extension, but to see what we can do to encourage and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
promote further SAYE share option schemes. That is a way of breaking down some of the old us and them barriers of which we have seen too much in the past. It would build a constituency of interest between managers and employees, and should be welcomed. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how the Government will try to promote the right to take up a SAYE share option scheme in the future, in particular with regard to small companies and the inherent difficulties that they have operating as unquoted institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of my concerns have been raised, but I do not agree with the emphasis placed on some of them. Perhaps my understanding is not as good as other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause attempts to allow people to move within companies more freely without their savings-related share options suffering a penalty. I am anxious for that to work properly; if it does not, there will be a major problem. Previous major restructuring in sections of British industry caused massive problems for people with pensions. For example, many people may have had a pension in a subsidiary company that was subsequently broken down. That caused major problems, including financial loss. Savings-related share option schemes are now 15 years old, so they are relatively new in the great scheme of things. The ability of a person to move within a restructured company should not be hindered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the problems that beset the British car industry in the 1960s and 1970s recur in another section of British industry or commerce, will the Minister assure us that people will not suffer with regard to their employee-related share option schemes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West said that savings-related share option schemes were important and could be a useful tool to break down the old barrier of them and us. I am sure that he is right. However, we do not want to break down a barrier in one part of society simply to recreate it elsewhere. We shall create another two-tier society if we do not look after those who are effectively transient members of our work force by offering them opportunities to enter into and to leave savings-related share option schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We earlier compared the structures of employment in Japan and Great Britain. In Japan—and increasingly in this country—employers are sticking with a core work force who are kept secure, and who work for long periods, if not their entire lives, with one employer. Through the use of subcontracts, temporary contracts and general fluctuations in business, another section of the work force has no long-term employment prospects with a company. Work is put out to a supplier company that is effectively totally dependent on a core company, but it lacks the profits and share base in which employees can become involved. If we break down one barrier by allowing employees to become part of the ownership structure of the companies in which they work, but do not allow other sections of the work force to take advantage of share options—in other words, if we allow those rights to be exercised by core workers alone—we should create another barrier in society. That would not help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
The Government's thrust of policy is to encourage people to increase their personal savings and pensions, for example, so as to decrease the burden of the old age pension on the state. That matter has been discussed in the House and in debates up and down the land. The Government's approach will not work if only a relatively privileged section of the work force is able to save and to benefit from tax breaks. Large sections of the work force have absolutely nothing—they will be totally dependent on state provision when they retire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much scepticism about the Government's intention to encourage employee-related share option schemes and savings-related share option schemes. It is widely believed that the Government are not serious about giving people a stake in companies. The Government may continue to allow those at the top to make massive gains, especially in the public utilities. However, they have to wrap that up in some sort of fig leaf. Employee share options, and the extension of that concept to items such as savings-related share options, are simply a political charade that allow a few people to gain massively, but do not allow the vast majority of the British work force to get a stake in the enterprises in which they work.

Although I do not agree with the point of view that was expressed, a certain issue was raised with me and I should like to make the Minister aware of it. Some months ago, on behalf of Labour's Front Bench team, I met with representatives of the United Kingdom Shareholders' Association. They were scathing about deliberate tax breaks for employees, who were effectively handed shares and given preferential treatment to that given to ordinary shareholders. The association's representatives were put out by that; they said that, while there should be mechanisms to allow employees to get into and out of owning shares in their companies, they did not see why employees should receive preferential treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we try to extend and improve those schemes—indeed, we should make them more universal in respect of employees of small companies, short-term contract employees and other transient members of the work force—those who live off the income derived from share dividends will experience increasing alarm. I do not know what can be done to win those people over to the idea that it is important that employees enjoy a stake in the enterprises in which they work as well as those who choose to invest their savings in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a wide ranging and interesting debate, covering a vast part of the canvas. We have debated various schemes that enable employees to participate in the equity of businesses that employ them. With your indulgence, Mr. Hill, I hope to range a little wider than the narrow provisions in the clause because that will allow me to reply to the points raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain phrase was haunting me as I listened to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and his colleagues. The phrase was "when a sinner repenteth". I looked back into the annals of Parliament to find that, in 1980, the Opposition voted against the introduction of SAYE schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unnecessarily controversial, but I am delighted that the Opposition are now on side in that respect. In the spirit of conciliation, after that little historical prod, I should like to say that anyone reading the debate will be heartened by the strong support for our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is part of a portfolio of improvements that we have made in a genuine effort to respond to representations from the many companies that want wider participation by their work forces through share ownership. The hon. Member for Dudley, West perceptively put his finger on the fact that many companies have a range of ways in which shares can be offered to their employees. When I first started to interest myself in this matter, I was struck by how many companies had company share option plans, SAYE schemes or profit-sharing arrangements. Companies have tailored entry requirements to meet the specific needs of different sections of their work force, taking into account the many and varied ways in which people are employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than trying to tell the Committee what the Government are doing to make life better and to promote share up-take, it might be better if I inform the Committee of industry's response to the changes that we have made. As I said earlier today, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary wrote to 250 leading companies in this country asking for their opinions on the changes. I can give only a small cross-section of the views expressed, but it is representative. Vickers wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We already have a high level of employee participation through twice yearly opportunities to participate under the existing SAYE Share Option Scheme provisions and I anticipate that we will be taking advantage of the further encouragement from the new arrangements".</p></blockquote>
Slough Estates also endorses our approach. Cadbury Schweppes, which is based in the part of the world of the hon. Member for Dudley, West, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Company has conducted Save As You Earn option schemes for over twenty years and over 7,400 of our UK employees currently participate in the schemes. We are confident that this number will soon rise as a result of the Government's initiatives and we will do our part to ensure that employees understand the importance of these changes".</p></blockquote>
That shows that we have responded to those who want to promote wider share ownership. Through the clauses that we are considering this afternoon, we are putting forward improvements to make the schemes, in modern parlance, more user-friendly. Those letters attest to the fact that the companies operating the schemes will seek to take advantage of the changes, such as that set out in the clause, to promote the schemes internally. The hon. Members for Edinburgh, Central and for Dudley, West highlighted the fact that the schemes focus on commitment and motivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central lead me to the conclusion that, for greater accuracy, I must put on the record the precise nature of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on from the ways in which industry can make schemes more attractive to employees, what information has he to hand, further to what he has given us, about the take-
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
up of share option schemes by part-timers following the changes made last year and about the distribution of the take-up among different wage bands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Lady the comfort of that information because members are members. I have seen no breakdown giving details of part-time members. The SAYE scheme has always been available to part-timers if the company so wished. The 1994 legislation made that mandatory. We have underpinned the position of part-time workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause makes an improvement to the tax relief for approved savings-related option schemes. It enables participants in those schemes who move between companies in the same group or under common control to exercise their options in circumstances where at present the law currently prevents them from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The improvement is technical and is made in response to the representations of share scheme lawyers, who pointed out that the law can create unfairness in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under a savings-related option scheme, an employee saves on a monthly basis—at present for five years—under a contract with a bank or building society. When the five-year period is up, the employee gets back the amount saved, together with a tax-free bonus, or, if he chooses, he may leave the savings for a further two years to qualify for a higher bonus. The amount saved, together with the five or seven-year bonus, can then be used to exercise an option to buy shares at a price fixed at the beginning of the period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law provides that options under approved schemes can be exercised at the bonus date only if the option holder is at that date an employee or director of the company which set up the scheme, or of another company which participates in that scheme. The purpose of a savings-related option scheme—or any option scheme—is to tie employees into the fortunes of the company, which be affected by their performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was put to us that the rule could work unfairly if an employee in a scheme is transferred to another company which, although it does not participate in the scheme, is nevertheless sufficiently closely connected for employees' performance to matter—a company in the same group or under common control. That might happen as a result of restructuring—to return to the point made by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) —such as a reorganisation or a takeover. The effect of the current rule is that an employee who is working for a non-participating company of that sort at the bonus date cannot exercise the option at that date. Unless he is transferred back to a participating company within six months—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may just finish the point that I am making, I shall gladly give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless an employee such as I described is tranferred back to a participating company within six months, the period during which there is a right of exercise, he will not be able to exercise the option at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with representations to the effect that it is unfair to deprive people who have been moved within company groups of the opportunity of exercising their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
options at the appropriate time, when their savings contracts mature. The clause would enable them to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like some clarification about common control, although I am sure that the Minister's intentions accord with what we would like. The Hanson group, for example, has been broken up into four companies. Assuming that some are under common control, the clause would clearly benefit employees who were shifted among them. My question concerns what would happen in the case of a management buy-out of part of a company, after which no legal connection remained and the enterprise was run by different people from previously—although it might, initially, be in the business of supplying components, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East suggested. Would the clause apply in those circumstances or is something further needed? Although there might not be common control in such a case, there might still be a relationship, which might change over the relevant period. Given the Minister's comments, it would seem desirable that the people concerned in such a case should not be disrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that, very helpfully, the Economic Secretary has on hand a letter from Lord Hanson, explaining matters. I am sure that he will be able to enlighten the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A piece of paper has been passed to me which I shall refer to in a second.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not immediately recognise in the broad circumstances outlined by the hon. Gentleman anything that would be covered by clause 104. I have made matters as clear as I can in general terms, but one would want carefully to examine the structure of the relevant organisation. The issue as I understand it concerns common ownership of a group. The hon. Gentleman described the situation following a management buyout, so it sounds as if the relevant part of the company would be separated wholly from its previous arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The piece of paper in my hand shows that Hanson responded and made certain comments about the intention—I am sure that we all read press reports on the subject—to de-merge the four businesses. Mr. Bonham, the deputy chairman, wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that each of those businesses will adopt their own share schemes and will take into account the chancellor's proposals when considering the form of those schemes."</p></blockquote>
Hanson welcomes what we are doing. In the context that has been described, it appears that its employees will be taken care of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) focused our minds on what the clause is about—SAYE schemes. She and her hon. Friends probed the Government's intentions in making the changes. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central also talked about that question, and wanted to know what else we were thinking of. In the package of changes to the SAYE scheme and others we have tried to respond to representations that have been made to us by those who advocate wider share ownership through the three schemes. They have said that if the savings period
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
before options can be exercised were reduced, and other measures were taken, which we shall discuss later, take-up would be wider. That is attested to by the letters that we have received. People have already responded positively and intend to take advantage of the opportunity to improve participation and, inevitably, motivation. By reducing the monthly contribution to as little as£5 we have made it clear to those in the participating companies, who want to commit themselves to their company by saving up for an option with Government help through the tax breaks of SAYE, that the door is open to as many people as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with the point that I raised about the blue collar work force in large companies, who are more often employed on short-term arrangements than used to be the case? The clause does not seem to offer them much solace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is not designed to offer solace in quite the way suggested by the hon. Lady. I told the Committee—at some length, to avoid doubt—precisely what the clause is designed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a point raised by the hon. Member for Dudley, West about people who are employed for shorter periods. A profit sharing scheme might be a better way to advance wider equity participation than a save-as-you-earn scheme, because companies can tailor a profit sharing scheme and the acquisition of shares to meet the various needs of its employees. It sometimes happens that people come in and out of companies and are actually employed by other companies with schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must focus on the fact that we have a portfolio of different ways to enable companies to advance wider share ownership and partnership in their schemes. We have made such schemes easier and more user-friendly. That was brought home to me when, quite by chance, I sat next to the managing director of one of the regional electricity distribution companies, who told me about one of his linesmen. He said that that employee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fat cat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that linesmen are fat cats—purring kittens, perhaps, but certainly not fat cats. That linesman had acquired shares when the company was privatised, had entered the SAYE scheme and was acquiring shares in his own right; and every time he met the managing director—I was delighted to hear that they can talk man to man—he said, "Keep the share price driving forward." That man was highly motivated; he had made a personal commitment with his own money through the SAYE scheme. It is surely right that a man of modest means can make a personal commitment to a company. I am sure that this measure will help to advance that cause substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central drew our attention to the new SAYE contract; the prospectus for that is expected by the end of April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that the three-year reduced period had been widely welcomed. It

	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
could be that all the letter writers spoke with one voice—three years, no more and no less. What about a period of two years or 18 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go back to what I was saying about shorter-term contracts. It is important that a company should have the option to tailor its schemes to meet the needs of its mix of employees. I do not want to be prescriptive and try to tell companies how they should deal with that situation. I say only that we listen to sensible points of view to try to improve such schemes. It is an important package of measures, and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for being helpful in his reply. Those who contributed to the debate seemed to believe that we should try to do more for those coming in and out of employment. Although I accept much of what the Minister said about the reasoning behind the clause and the opportunity to save—he has now brought it down to three years—we should consider, going further if we can. Clearly, the shorter period for which one works, and is therefore able to save, the less one can contribute. We must obviously bear that in mind. However, many people believe that the opportunities of becoming involved and having a stake in a company should be expanded. Many people are employed by companies for less than 18 months, and it will be interesting to see the figures for 1996–97 after a pattern has built up. Current figures show that more than a third of women in employment have been with an employer for less than 18 months. They are the very people to whom my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry, North-East and for Hillsborough referred. They are in and out of employment. Although I am glad that people with a company for a long time will receive the opportunities, I am concerned for those on the margins of employment. All of us should do what we can to improve their lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no difficulty with the example of the person from one of the English regional electricity companies whom the Financial Secretary mentioned. That person was part of a modest scheme. I have difficulty, however, with what the Government have done recently. We are all keen that those on modest incomes should do well, but the Government's main beneficence has been bestowed on those at the opposite end of the scale who have had their snouts stuck in the trough in a way that has heartily sickened most people. I am glad that the Government have to a certain extent closed off such widespread abuses. The should now concentrate their attention on helping those with more modest means, but who equally need to be motivated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of the common control point, the Financial Secretary has answered the questions about management buy-outs. I am not sure what Lord Hanson's employees will make of the Minister's assertion that they will be taken care of. Many people who have worked for Hanson have certainly been taken care of, but perhaps not in the way that the Minister meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the intention behind the clause. The debate has been extensive and useful. Those who follow
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
our proceedings will realise that a majority in the Committee support such schemes. There was silence on the Conservative Benches and no one dissented from the proposition that we should get as many people into these schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a short and simple question. Will the Financial Secretary explain what on earth the clause means? I have obtained an explanation in plain English that stretches to five lines. I should declare an interest. I am a member of the tax law review group's committee on the simplification of tax and this is just the sort of clause that should not be passed into law. It is complex and difficult to understand. I wonder whether it could not have been simpler.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it is one of the privatised clauses or an in-house job, but it is meant to provide for transitional relief from 17 July 1995—the postGreenbury period—until the Bill receives Royal Assent. Options of less than£30,000 will attract tax relief. It would help if the Minister could explain what clause 106(3) or 106(4) mean and clarify the assumptions on which they are based. I find them difficult to follow. I concede that I probably could not draft the Bill, but I am not paid to do that. However, before clause 106(3) and (4) become law, we should understand what they mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) is present because he was responsible for the new maximum limit of£30,000, which is covered by clause 106(1) and (2). When did the Minister first realise that the figure of£30,000 was right and the figure of£20,000 was wrong? How did he arrive at the wrong figure in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause effectively states that options issued after 17 July, and up to the point at which the Bill receives Royal Assent, will qualify for the new tax relief. The detailed sections in the clause, which are clearly laid out in the notes on clauses, describe in more precise and legalistic terms exactly what I have said. In answer to the hon. Member for Dudley, West: when I considered the argument put to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister can give us such a short explanation, I will leave him with this thought: those who draft such measures might consider putting the ministerial explanation into statute in place of what we have in front of us. The point is serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) has usually spoken at length by this stage, but he has remained remarkably quiet in the past few weeks. I see that his hon. Friends are desperate to hear from him. He has made the point in successive years that we should have a go at saying what we mean in tax law—I have an equally concise explanation, which I shall not bother to read out—and Ministers should consider publishing that.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates to profit-sharing schemes. The Minister's brief, which he is about to read to us, will no doubt state that they are part of the package which we are considering. We support them as a means by which employers can give shares to their employees tax free. They have to be all-employee schemes and must be available to all employees, including part-timers with more than five years' service. The measure is egalitarian and I am pleased to note that by 1994, the latest year for which I have figures, about 1 million employees were participating in the schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schemes are egalitarian, highly successful and very popular. Of course, they were introduced by the Labour Government in 1978. I make that point in view of the fact that at the beginning of the previous debate the Minister made a great deal of conversions. The schemes, which are the oldest of the statutory schemes that we have in front of us, come of respectable parentage and have been highly successful. It is not surprising that we support them.

The clause proposes to reduce the release date from five years to three years. The release date is the date on which tax becomes payable after the shares are sold. My question, I must confess, arises from a group of business men whom I addressed recently in Birmingham. I was asked whether the measure would provide an incentive to sell earlier. In case the Minister thinks that that is a fear of a left-wing extremist business man, I got the distinct impression from the questioner that if I was canvassing for his vote he would go down as a doubtful, if not more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the exercise must be to ensure that there are sustainable schemes. We will come back to the point when we discuss employee share ownership trusts under clause 110. I am worried that an incentive to sell might be provided if the release date is brought down to three years. It could be that, as in the other case, many letters have been received—they will no doubt emerge from the Economic Secretary's bag as soon as she gest back and be passed along to the Financial Secretary—that tell us that this is what industry wants. All I am saying to the Minister is that one part of industry in the west midlands has expressed concern. I understand that point, or I would not have raised the matter.

As for profit-sharing schemes, we want to encourage them because they are part of the philosophy of encouraging greater participation and commitment and
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
they have a savings element. They satisfy many of the conditions that we should like to be satisfied by all share-ownership schemes and, as I said, it is not surprising that they do. They ought to receive more promotion. They have much in common with profit-related pay, although that is a different type of scheme. Both types of scheme encourage employees to have regard to the company's profits. Obviously, if a company is to thrive and do well, it is important that it has sufficient profit, not just to reward those who work in it, but also to generate sufficient funds to re-invest. Such schemes focus attention on effort and ensure that an employee's actions matter not only to the company but to the individual and to those who invest in the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Profit-sharing schemes focus attention on the longer term. Achieving that long-term culture is important, which is why I raised the point about the release date. I am worried that it will encourage people to get out rather sooner than they would otherwise want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Profit-sharing schemes are in contrast to profit-related pay, which has some advantages. It focuses attention on the company being profitable and people make a greater commitment, but the scheme is short-term and tends to be an annual contract. I know that profit-related pay continues for longer than that, but it is usually an annual event, based on the company's annual profit. That influences what amount is available for dividing up among the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see from the Red Book, that the cost to the Exchequer in tax forgone of profit sharing is£80 million a year. That represents good value for money. It represents a change in culture that we would like to see. That figure is not excessive—it is money well spent. My hon. Friend the Member of Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), the shadow Chief Secretary, will note that I have not suggested£81 million. The figure stands in stark contrast to the cost of profit-related pay, which is£800 million a year. I was surprised about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second main point that I want to put to the Minister is that, as I said, profit sharing and profit-related pay are different but they are related in that both are geared to focusing emoployee attention on the profitability of a company. In an article last summer,	<i>The Independent</i>drew attention to the cost of profit-related pay. Is it the Government's intention that that cost should continue uncapped? Are the Government concerned about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed, from the appropriation accounts explanation, which the Government publish once a year, that one of the objectives of tax relief for PRP schemes was a closer identification of employees with the company for which they worked. That is common to such schemes and I wholeheartedly endorse that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Inland Revenue eventually conducted a survey to evaluate the extent to which companies were influenced in setting up PRP schemes, I was disappointed to note that 48 per cent. said that they would probably or definitely not expand a PRP scheme if there was no tax relief, and 38 per cent. said that they would probably or definitely withdraw from the scheme if tax relief was withdrawn. The most disturbing fact was that 75 per cent. of employers felt unable to comment on the success of their PRP schemes as a

	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
tax-efficient way of paying employees. That is a very odd statistic. Should we be doing more about getting people into profit-sharing rather than profit-related schemes? Both schemes have merit. I am instinctively attracted to profit-sharing schemes because of the longterm commitment required. We believe very strongly in long-term commitment as a means of encouraging people to have a stake in their enterprise. Profit-related schemes have a useful function in focusing employees' attention on their company's annual performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed in the survey published in the Pay and Benefits Bulletin, edition no. 360, which came out in September 1994, that tax relief was the largest driver for RPR schemes. Are the Government concerned about that and do they propose to put a cap on it? Given what the Government did to mortgage tax relief and the cost of that, have they anything to say about PRP schemes, which put the taxpayer in the position of subsidising pay increases? It would be useful if the Minister could tell us the Government's thinking on that issue, given that 2.5 million people benefit from PRP schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked me a question which I shall do my best to answer. Perhaps he could tell us the Labour party's position on these schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was listening carefully, when I was speaking, so his attention must have been distracted by a helpful note from his officials, probably asking him to make that point. I said that on profit-related pay, we see merit in both schemes. It is important for employees to have an incentive, as I have said time and time again. Indeed, this speech has been quoted with approval by the Prime Minister at Question Time—isolated bits of the speech, that is, not all of it. The right hon. Gentleman liked the bit where I observed that, for British industry in general, it is not the Government's job to sit in the board rooms. That is our view. He did not quote the bit where I said that the public were incensed about what was happening in the board rooms of privatised utilities. I also said in that speech that employees from the board room to the shop floor should have incentives. My complaint against the Government has always been that they are more concerned with the Cedrics of this world than the Sids. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Economic Secretary looks baffled. Cedric is soon to be the late chief executive of British Gas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pronounced "Cedric".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be delighted to have a debate on how his name is pronounced. I believe that there is a procedure by which Committees can call expert witnesses to appear before them. Perhaps we should call him before the Committee so that he can tell us the correct pronunciation. But how he pronounces his name is not the point. The Economic Secretary makes my point for me: she is very concerned about Cedric, but not so concerned about Sid—or perhaps I should say Sidney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the Financial Secretary's question is that both schemes have merit because they focus
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
everyone's attention on a company's performance. Executive share option schemes, however, tended to focus the senior directors' attention on a company's performance, while it was assumed that everyone else had to whipped as hard as possible, if not kicked out As I have said, everyone should have incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, this is the hon. Gentleman's Bill. Are the Government concerned that profit-related pay schemes are costing £800 million a year, or are they completely unconcerned? I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, profit-sharing schemes cost£80 million a year. We should always be mindful that there is a cost to the Exchequer when tax relief is granted, so we should be careful. In my view, taxpayers' money should be used to encourage long-term commitment—to encourage people to have a stake in their company. That is good for the country as a whole. If people have that incentive and commitment, the benefit will be felt in terms of increased output, increased Exchequer receipts, and so on. If the Financial Secretary's attention is not completely distracted by what is going on behind him, all that I would like to say to him about profit-related pay is that I am disappointed to note that the Government appear to have no idea of the relationship between the cost of profit-related pay and the increased performance of British industry. Another note is on its way to the Financial Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If£800 million a year of taxpayers' money is spent, we are entitled to ask about the net gain. I can see the merit of profit-related pay—2.5 million people are participating in it. But when we grant tax relief—for venture capital trusts, say—or tax is forgone, we should know the benefit of it. I shall be fascinated to hear what the Financial Secretary has to say when he has assembled all his notes and reads them to us. That will be extremely useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many representations have been made to the Government about profit-sharing schemes, and we want the schemes to develop further. They require long-term commitment because they encourage people to be locked in. I suppose that for the sake of completeness, I should refer again to the table from the labour force survey, and mention that many people are being left out and are not able to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some preliminary thoughts and no doubt other members of the Committee will wish to speak. I look forward with great anticipation to what the Financial Secretary has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central welcomed the clause and offered the Labour party's support in general terms for profit-sharing schemes which the last Labour Government introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have slightly more reservations than my hon. Friend about the detailed operation of profit-related pay schemes. However, I see some merit in them. It is important to recognise that profit-sharing schemes are targeted mainly at publicly-quoted companies. They are available to unquoted companies, but those companies suffer the difficulty mentioned earlier of having to have shares valued by the share value division of the Inland Revenue, which is a great deal of hassle for many small
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
businesses. It is much more complicate for them to be involved in profit-sharing schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the benefits of PRP schemes, by contrast, is that they are relatively simple to set up and, during the past few years, a number of consultancy firms have offered small companies advice on how to do that. As they are not share based, they can apply to small companies, so they provide a necessary balance in the system by offering employees who miss out on other schemes the ability to participate in a tax perk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, all too often PRP schemes have been abused and used by companies as a tax dodge. The Committee may not know that before I was elected to the House, I spent a substantial amount of time talking to Government staff about the Treasury model of policy evaluation. When we apply Treasury principles of evaluation to measures such as a PRP scheme, we find a substantial level of programme dead weight, which especially concerns me and—I think that my hon. Friend was making this point—not a great deal of evidence of any additionality in terms of encouraging corporate performance. The	<i>Pay and Benefits Bulletin</i>1994 survey referred to earlier noted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Half of all respondents … preparing or running schemes have used the legislation to gain tax relief for payments from an existing profit sharing bonus … Just over a quarter … have replaced a predetermined portion of each employee's basic pay with an element of PRP."</p></blockquote>
A further 18 per cent. of organisations have substituted a PRP pay out for an annual pay increase.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I seek your guidance.

Having listened to people in the industry who do not benefit from income tax relief, I see some merit in reducing the period to three years during which shares are locked up. As I have said, I support profit sharing schemes. However, I support my hon. Friend's comments about PRP schemes and their cost to the Exchequer. The matter must be dealt with in future, although perhaps not under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
reviewed the notes that I took on the interesting trip that we had round the clause. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked a relevant question about a Birmingham businessman with whom he consorted to find out whether he was worried about an early sale of shares which his employees might acquire through the scheme. Those shares might be saleable earlier because of clause 107.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause was introduced as a result of our consultation with companies and those involved in wider share ownership. They said that the way to make the schemes more attractive was to shorten the period of release of the shares acquired by profit sharing schemes. Evidence shows that employees hang on to their shares. The point of being part and parcel of a scheme is to acquire equity participation in a company, the value of which, it is hoped, will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have answered the Birmingham business man's question. We have made the scheme more attractive, but reality suggests that people stay in the scheme and hold on to their shares. They are very much the Sids rather than the Cedrics, or the "Ceedrics" if that is more understandable to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. As for other schemes that involve profit, as always we keep them under review. I am surprised that the hon.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with employee share ownership trusts. Once again, I should make it clear at the outset that we want to encourage employee share ownership trusts because they are a way of ensuring sustainable share ownership. The clause makes it easier for trusts to be set up by removing the qualification that a beneficiary has to have one year's service. Now an employee can become a beneficiary from the moment that he walks through the front door of the enterprise. As I said, we broadly encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the advantages of employee share ownership trusts is that they can spread rather than concentrate the wealth of a company. Shares are held by a trust for the benefit of employees, which might not otherwise happen. However, there is concern—we have seen it with the privatised utilities—that when shares are passed on to employees either immediately or from trusts they are subsequently sold. That is, of course, the right of any share owner: no one can force people to retain them. However, if we consider the National Freight Corporation, it is unfortunate that while employees bought the majority of the shares on privatisation—the tag was that it was a successful employee—owned National Freight—they now own very few. Performance improved due to the commitment, the share price went up, the shares became illiquid and had to be floated on the stock exchange to solve the problem, and, as a result, ownership went outside the company. Management changes also took place, and that changed the company's whole culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employee share ownership trusts are one means of ensuring that a proportion of the shares are owned on behalf of the employees and remain so. As I understand the law, however, the shares that the trust holds must be disbursed at the end of a certain period. Why will the Government now allow open-ended employee share ownership trusts? That might be one way of creating a vehicle for buying and selling shares and retaining them so that employees have a significant stake in the company that they own. We all want to encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those members of the Committee who have spoken want to ensure that once employees have a stake in the company, they keep it. Neither I nor anyone else wants to prevent people who own shares—whether or not they work for a company—from selling them. If they want to do that, nothing in the world should make them hold on to them. Mechanisms should allow employees or others to have a stake, and the employee share ownership trust would do that. It would ensure that wealth is spread among all the employees and is not concentrated. In that way it promotes employee
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
commitment, the company's economic success and productive, longer term relations between labour and capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was recently approached by the managing director of Tullis Russell, a company that is based in Kinross and which has other factories in England. The family wanted to expand and more or less transferred the firm to its employees. That is not necessarily a perfect model in every case, but it is one way of creating motivation and commitment among employees. The family used the trust mechanism and made it clear to me that the trust restricted its activities because it was not open-ended. That is unfortunate. It would be helpful if the Minister dealt with that point and confirmed whether my understanding of the clause is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for the way in which he listened to the arguments of Job Ownership Ltd, of which I am an honorary, unpaid director.

It clearly demonstrates that the time has come for the cause of employee share ownership and that the Government believe in it. I pay tribute to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that the time has come for employee share ownership trusts.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to clause 110 and its limited nature. It removes one of the reasons why people who want to set up an employee share ownership plan choose a case law ESOP and not a statutory ESOP, but there are several other reasons why plans that are set up under case law are preferred in the marketplace to those that are set up on a statutory basis. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham tabled his amendments to try to probe the issue, but I will not steal his thunder by talking about it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike case law ESOPs, a statutory ESOP cannot be used with share option schemes such as the share-save scheme. The employee benefit trust of an ESOP must also sell shares to the profit share interest at full market value. That can lead to a capital gains tax bill if the shares have risen in value since the trust bought them. Case law ESOPs can transfer shares between trusts at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
the price at which they were originally bought. That avoids the ESOP and hence the company being landed with a hefty capital gains tax bill if the price of the shares has risen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory ESOPs have another drawback in that some of the employee benefit trust's trustees must be employees; there are no such restrictions on the composition of the trustees of case law ESOPs. A case law ESOP can also be established offshore, which has obvious tax advantages, whereas the trustees of a statutory ESOP have by law to be resident in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the reasons why case law ESOPs are still much preferred to the Government's statutory employee share ownership trusts as they exist at the moment. We need to address the reasons why ESOPs have not yet taken off. Further changes are likely to be required in future Finance Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Merely removing one of the barriers so that workers of less than one year's standing are allowed to join is not going to solve the problem, because it will still be the case—as I understand the legislation—that all employees must be offered shares on similar terms. That sounds fine in principle, but it means that new employees cannot be given shares without offering them to the entire work force as well. Again, that is a fundamental problem while the statutory ESOP works as it does now. It is one of the reasons why scores of ESOPs are being set up on a common law basis and not on a statutory basis. Hon. Members on both sides of the House think that such bodies should be encouraged. I want the legislation to be amended so that more of them go down the statutory route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we move off this subject, several hon. Members have touched on the usefulness of the gamut of employee share option schemes in increasing employees' motivation and involvement in their company. Employees are concerned that even if they set up ESOPs and ESOTs, they will still have no real influence at the annual general meetings of the boards of companies in which they have shares. That point has not yet been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government frequently disclaim responsibility for Cedric's excesses and for those of various privatised utilities. They say that action against chief executives or directors of such companies must be the responsibility of shareholders and has nothing to do with Government. If it is the responsibility of shareholders, the drive towards giving shareholders more say in their company should result in them having more say at annual general meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware of a significant increase in the influence of employee shareholders at critical meetings compared with the influence of larger institutional conglomerate shareholders who still hold the majority of shares in most of the big corporations and companies in this country. Does the Minister think that these measures will lead to employee shareholders having a greater influence at meetings?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
Some of my colleagues and I had a meeting yesterday with Professor Uff, who has embarked on an inquiry into what went wrong with the management of Yorkshire Water during last year's draught. A report has been published today about the responsibility of people in senior positions. In my opinion Professor Uff s inquiry will find it difficult not to be critical of the senior directors and executives in Yorkshire Water. How are ordinary shareholders, who are dying to make their points at shareholders' meetings about the performance of those executives, to have a say?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that I am straying from the clause, but I want to make the point that hon. Members in all parts of the House have agreed that the main purpose of share options is to give employees a greater stake in their companies. Until the individual shareholder has a significant influence on decisions about action that may lead to the resignation of some of those top executives for their poor performance, there will be a measure of scepticism about whether share options provide greater industrial democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have again taken a quick flight over employee share ownership trusts and employee share ownership schemes. I shall try to land at the appropriate airport and respond to the issues that have been raised. On behalf of my right hon. and learned Friend and others who have listened, may I say how much we appreciate the representations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman). He has been a noble fighter for the cause, even when it was not popular. I congratulate him on his dogged determination to continue to advocate improvements. The clause is about one of the improvements to the operation of employee share owning trusts that was advocated to us by those, including my hon. Friend, who support such trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central raised an interesting matter when he tested the meaning of the clause. The clause removes the one-year service requirement so as to make a statutory ESOT more flexible. We had been advised that the lack of that facility militated against management-employee buyouts of companies. Such buy-outs are structured through a newly formed company, which means that employees cannot meet the one-year service requirement. The removal of that requirement is a small step towards greater flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the ultimate form of participation—the members of a company using the facility provided by the clause to take over the enterprise. That is also the ultimate expression of their confidence in both company and management. All hon. Members should welcome the provision: it is an important element in our discussion on participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked me to confirm his understanding of the period for which ESOTs must hold shares. I can confirm that the period is 20 years. The hon. Gentleman related to the Committee a conversation which dealt with the longevity of such trusts and the implications consequent on the views that they put forward.

requirement to distribute any one share or tranche of shares that it acquires to an individual employee within 20 years. That juxtaposition of the continuity of the trust with the principal purpose of its establishment—to make shares more widely available to the employees—shows why some of the ideas about some sort of long-term ownership of the company by the trust are not compatible with the purpose behind the trusts's establishment. That purpose—to promulgate the ownership of the company as widely as possible—also assists in the creation of an internal market in a company for that company's shares I shall not go into too much detail, as I am sure that we shall return to the subject.

The hon. Member for Dudley, West appeared to ignore a salient feature of the Bill, which is that it applies save-as-you-earn schemes to statutory ESOTs. There has never been a barrier in case law. I can see by his nod that the hon. Gentleman accepts that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hillsborough resumed a theme that is familiar in her contributions—the question of shareholder participation. It should be noted that the people about whom we are talking are employees of a company. There can be no greater participation than owning some part of the company for which one works. I doubt that employees with no confidence and no say in a company's future would exercise the rights conferred in such schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that only two years ago all the employees who held shares in the company that I used as an example signed a motion and resolution at their annual general meeting. The motion was supported by a number of local authorities and made it clear that the company's employees were nominating as a director a person who did not belong to the company at that time. All the top executive directors issued a circular saying that they did not approve of that. There was a direct confrontation and the employee shareholders were wiped out by the institutional shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note the point, but there is always a health warning about any participation in an equity. Risks are associated with that. I will not trespass into outlining the risks associated with equity, but they are important. The dialogue between management and employees, and the many ways in which it can occur, is part and parcel of making company participation work. The theory of equity participation is the reason why we are discussing the issue and why it is widely supported on both sides of the Committee. It is considered to be beneficial to the relevant companies. The clause intends to help those who want to take the ultimate step of buying their company.

That is why we introduced the clause: it was a response to the representations put to us on behalf of those he represents by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington in an attempt to improve the use of the statutory ESOT in particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now move to a highly controversial subject in the Bill—self-assessment. The issue is of considerable importance for businesses, especially for partnerships. Business men and business women in partnerships will be among those groups who are most detrimentally affected by the rushed way in which the legislation on self-assessment has been promoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mess is of the Government's creation. Let me make it clear that the Labour party believes that the concept of self-assessment is good. However, we have considerable difficulty with the way in which the Government have rushed through the proposal. I should like to use the clause as an example to show how the Government have decided to push through the whole concept of self-assessment in a way that is unnecessarily complex for business people and the self-employed. It will cause those people problems in assessing their tax and submitting tax returns. If we are to ask people to carry out their own assessments and fill in the forms, they need clarity and the absence of ambiguity. They need to know how to carry out self-assessment and they must be able to examine the relevant legislation in a sensible and straightforward manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose today to examine a clause that will be of great interest to partners dealing with their tax affairs. However, in order to understand the clause, they will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
have to look at a whole series of Acts. Parts of the clause re-write sections of the Taxes Management Act 1970, the Finance Act 1994 and the Finance Act 1995. Until what the law says is clear, it will be extremely difficult for business people and partners of firms to know how to carry out self-assessment. Yesterday, in one of our national newspapers, I saw an advertisement urging partners, the self-employed and business people to be prepared for self-assessment. I ask you to consider, Mr. Hill, if you were running a business, how you could be prepared for legislation such as this when it is so unclear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to section 12AB of the Taxes Management Act 1970. I would like to draw the Committee's attention to one part of that—section 12AB(1). Just imagine that you are a partner in a firm, Mr. Hill, considering the clause in the Bill, and you need to know what to do. The clause amends the Taxes Management Act 1970, so you look up that piece of legislation to read the section that it amends. But it simply is not there. In law, it exists but, in practice, if one examines a copy of the Act, it does not. That is because it was amended by the Finance Act 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me outline the contents of section 12AB, regarding partnership returns to include partnership statements, in the Finance Act 1994. It is important that we should examine it in detail because I want to demonstrate the Government's approach. I want to put you, Mr. Hill, and members of the Committee in the position of being a partner in a firm who is required to examine the detail of the Bill. I want to ensure that we get on the record exactly what has to be dealt with by the ordinary person. It will take some time, but it is worth doing because it will show what we are dealing with in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are supposed to be considering the Taxes Management Act 1970. The first reference to section 12AB of that Act is in section 185 of the Finance Act 1994 which is titled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Partnership return to include partnership statement."</p></blockquote>
It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every return under Section 12AA of this Act shall include a statement (a partnership statement) of the following amounts, namely—
	<ol>
	<li>in the case of each period of account ending within the period in respect of which the return is made—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the amount of income or loss from each source which, on the basis of the information contained in the return, has accrued to or has been sustained by the partnership for that period, and</li>
	<li>the amount of each charge which, on that basis, was a charge on the income of the partnership for that period; and</li></ol>
	<li>in the case of each such period and each of the partners, the amount which, on that basis, is equal to his share of that amount, loss or charge.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) Subject to subsection (3) below—
	<ol>
	<li>at any time before the end of the period of nine months beginning with the day on which a person's return is delivered, an officer of the Board may by notice to that person so amend that person's partnership statement as to correct any obvious errors or mistakes in the return (whether errors of principle, arithmetical mistakes or otherwise); and</li>
	<li>at any time before the end of the period of twelve months beginning with the filing date, a person may by notice to an officer of the Board so amend his partnership statement as to give effect to any amendments to his return which he has notified to such an officer.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) No amendment of a partnership statement may be made under subsection (2) above at any time during the period—
	<ol>
	<li>beginning with the day on which an officer of the Board gives notice of his intention to enquire into the return, and</li>
	<li>ending with the day on which the officer's enquiries into the return are completed.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) Where a partnership statement is amended under subsection (2) above, the officer shall by notice to the partners so amend their self-assessments under section 9 or 1 IAA of this Act as to give effect to the amendments of the partnership statement.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) In this section—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'filing date' means the day specified in the notice under subsection (2) or, as the case may be, subsection (3) of section 12AA of this Act;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'period of account', in relation to a partnership, means any period for which accounts are drawn up."</p></blockquote>
As a partner in a firm, having read all that, you may think you have found the elusive section that should have been in the 1970 Act, but not so. You would have go to to section 104(7) of the Finance Act 1995 which you would have to interpret in the light of the previous Finance Act. Remember, this is for self-assessment purposes. We are not talking about an accountant who will be paid to spend time analysing that stuff. We are talking about a small business person or a self-employed person, certainly a partner in a firm, who may have to do such work. Indeed, we have not yet heard anything about the partner who is nominated to carry out that work in the business. At this stage, he has not yet appeared, so we are not sure who he is. He does not appear until later in the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me tell you, Mr. Hill, about section 104(7) which amends that 1970 Act. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For subsection (1) of section 12AB of that Act—"</p></blockquote>
which is not in the 1970 Act—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(partnership return to include partnership statement) there shall be substituted the following subsection—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Every return under section 12AA of this Act shall include a statement (a partnership statement) of the following amounts, namely—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) in the case of each period of account ending within the period in respect of which the return is made—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) the amount of income or loss from each source which, on the basis of the information contained in the return and taking into account any relief or allowance a section 42(7) claim"— </p></blockquote>
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not delay the Committee by detailing section 42(7) claims, but I draw the Committee's attention to the reference—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for which is included in the return, has accrued to or has been sustained by the partnership for that period,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) each amount of income tax which, on that basis, has been deducted or treated as deducted from any income of the partnership, or treated as paid on any such income, for that period,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(iii) the amount of each tax credit which, on that basis, has accrued to the partnership for that period, and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(iv) the amount of each charge which, on that basis, was a charge on the income of the partnership for that period; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) in the case of each such period and each of the partners, the amount which, on that basis and (where applicable) taking into account any such relief or allowance, is equal to his share of that income, loss, tax, credit or charge'."</p></blockquote>
That should be it, but it is not. I am afraid that you, Mr. Hill, as the partner now has to look—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the Financial Secretary? I am sure that he would like to be the partner who has to deal with this. Perhaps he could deal with it, but I suspect that someone who does not deal with such matters on a day-to-day basis might have some difficulty finding his or her way through this complex legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now read out the part of the clause that we are debating. It is important that the reference to section 12AB of the Act—which is the small part that I am trying to understand—it is put on the record in full so that anybody wishing to understand it can read it. Clause 114(5) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In subsection (1) of section 12AB of that Act (partnership return to include partnership statement) —</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) in paragraph (a), for the words 'each period of account ending within the period in respect of which the return is made'"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is this absolutely necessary? We all have a copy of the Bill before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is necessary for the reason that a partner in a firm has to look at the Bill, the Finance Act 1995, the Finance Act 1994 and then try to find where it is all supposed to be in the Taxes Management Act 1970—only it is not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are all following carefully, so I assume that we can follow clause 5(d), which the hon. Gentleman was about to read out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all have a copy in front of us. The hon. Gentleman may paraphrase, if he wishes, but I do not think that it is necessary to read out the whole thing—here is another reason for doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am doing this to make sure that the partner—agreed that it would probably be the Financial Secretary for the purposes of the exercise— his way through the complexities of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heed your words, Mr. Hill and shall not quote in detail. However, we begin to know who should be filling in the document. It is surprising that it should have taken so much time and so much legislation to arrive at that point. Anyone wishing fully to understand the issue must find their way through that. That point should be made forcefully. The Financial Secretary must give us clarity and detail on the meaning. It is clear that the provisions were too complex for the Inland Revenue, otherwise the matter would have been sorted out in the Finance Act 1994, but no one ensured that the reference in the Bill was in that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government had a chance to correct that in the Finance Act 1995. They inserted amendments from the 1994 Act, but they did not mention the issues that have
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
now been raised. I suspect that there are things missing from this Bill as well. There is every reason to think that that is likely. We know that the Government missed measures out of the 1994 and 1995 Acts. Any partner who says that he understands the measures will have difficulty explaining them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee has learnt a lot from that explanation and will treat the matter with the relevance that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seldom heard such a demonstration of the chop suey approach to politics—chop up everything that can be found, chuck it in the pan, whizz it around and hope that it will be vaguely edible. I have heard that load of old codswallop and it contained nothing vaguely edible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) claims to be a professional person. If he ever went back to private practice as a solicitor, I doubt that he would have many takers if that is the best explanation that he can give of a piece of tax law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause makes a minor change on partnership returns and introduces no new concepts in relation to the 1994 Act. A partnership return is usually given to all members of a partnership collectively, but a single partner is required to complete it and declare it to be correct. For all tax purposes, the actions of that partner are binding on all other partners. That is no more than a special application of one of the conerstones of partnership law—the actions of any partner are usually binding on the others. If the person who takes responsibility for the partnership form is unable to complete it, the partners can nominate somebody else. I am not a lawyer or a tax expert. If I can explain the measure so succinctly, many partners, who are professionals, will easily understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the real world, a great deal of information in lay language will be made available to all types of taxpayer. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire ignored the fact that self-assessment does not change the information which taxpayers have to provide, because it relates to the existing taxes. The change is to the format in which the information is supplied. A great deal of information has already been supplied. Partners will have no difficulty in understanding the simple and beneficial change proposed in clause 114.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
