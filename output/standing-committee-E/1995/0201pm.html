ELECTRICALLY PROPELLED VEHICLES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment moved [this day]:</i> No. 31, in page 6, line 44, leave out from "duty)" to end of line 46 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>",after paragraph 2(1)(a) there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'(aa) £10 if the motorcycle is an electrically propelled vehicle,'.".—[<i>Ms Primarolo.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before lunch I moved this amendment, which seeks to reduce the vehicle excise duty on electrically propelled motor cycles to £10, which is less than the £15 proposed by the Government. I reminded the Committee that duty on petrol motor cycles is also £15. By introducing differential fuel duties on unleaded petrol, the Government have shown that they are keen to encourage environmentally friendly activity in consumption. The use of electrically propelled motor cycles is considerably better for the environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government cannot support the amendment for a number of reasons. At £15, the proposed vehicle excise duty for these electrical vehicles is generous: it is the lowest rate applied to motor cycles. It can hardly be said that expenditure of £15 a year is a serious deterrent to anyone considering that mode of transport as against another.<br><br>
Our overall aim is to simplify the tax system. The Opposition, in another mode, has called for that. They have tabled an amendment or new clause to urge us to simplify the system. This amendment would take us in the opposite direct: it would create a new complication.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is not clear that electrically powered vehicles are as environmentally benign as the hon. Lady supposes. It is true that at the point of use electrical vehicles are almost non-polluting, but that is simply because the pollution is shifted to the source of power—the power station. In this country power is generated chiefly by the burning of fossil fuel. It is obvious that electrical vehicles derive their energy not from magic or from the Opposition, but by the burning of coal or gas elsewhere.<br><br>
Although the use of electrical vehicles results in an overall CO2 reduction, the emissions from power stations, such as oxide of nitrogen, particulate matter from dust and soot, and sulphur, are more polluting.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
Unfortunately, it is well known that British coal contains a comparatively high proportion of sulphur.<br><br>
We must look at the overall picture. It is not true that all electrical vehicles have an obvious environmental advantage. Having said that, they have a certain appeal, which is why they are advantageously taxed: they not only attract a low rate of vehicles excise duty—£35 for electrical cars and the proposed £15 for bicycles and tricycles—but are exempted from excise duty. Although we are increasing road fuel rates by 5 per cent. in real terms, that does not apply to electrical power. So electrical vehicles have a privileged status in the tax system. We do not want to add to that by taking an odd £5 off the proposed VED rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard it all now. We should be concentrating on power stations, not vehicles that contribute to poor air quality and pollution. I assume that the Paymaster General will later introduce proposals to tax power stations according to the environmental damage that they cause. We wait with bated breath to hear his comments about nuclear energy.<br><br>
The Paymaster General got into difficulties last year over vehicle excise duty on the highland islands and the Isles of Scilly. We told him then that he had been given a daft brief, and we should do so again. The ability of electric vehicles to improve urban air quality is beyond dispute. The amendment does not propose that all vehicles should be taxed at the level for electrically propelled vehicles. I doubt that there will be a massive surge across the grid as people plug in their electrically propelled motor cycles. We simply want clearly to set out the direction of future policy.<br><br>
The Paymaster General used entirely different arguments when he justified the measly 15 per cent. reduction in duty on gas fuels, which was intended to assist the gas fuel industry's development—he said that we needed to move cautiously. The amendment makes it clear that a vehicle will be treated more favourably if it is more environmentally friendly than one that runs on petrol. The Minister has not responded to that or explained why duties should be the same. The Opposition therefore press their amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to the notes on clauses, the Secretary of State for Transport will be able to define what constitutes an electrically assisted pedal cycle through secondary legislation. Given the Government's supposed commitment to deregulation, what useful purpose is served by yet more regulations which go into ludicrous details about what constitutes an electrically assisted pedal cycle and how it is distinguished from an electrically propelled motor cycle or other vehicles?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Secondary legislation should be clear and unambiguous and although we might think that we know what an electrically assisted pedal cycle is, the definition must be put beyond doubt in legislation. No doubt, the hon. Gentleman has heard about and read the Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycle Regulations 1983. If those are not familiar to the Committee, future regulations to amend them will be.<br><br>
The serious issue is that the Committee will give effect to a clear intention. To transpose that into a law which anticipates all possible varieties of electrically assisted pedal cycle is a matter for secondary legislation.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
STEAM POWERED VEHICLES ETC</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief comment. The clause provides that all steam powered vehicles be included in the special concessionary tax class, paying an annual duty of £35. That will be welcomed by all owners of such vehicles. This is a convenient moment at which to tell the Committee that the Government intend to go further and to exempt all non-commercial vehicles from vehicle excise duty if they are more than 25 years old.<br><br>
In the Budget, my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor announced that that discretion would apply to cars and motor cycles, which was warmly received. It has become apparent during subsequent discussions with interested parties that it makes sense to extend the discretion to all other non-commercial vehicles, such as lorries. They may not be very many in number but to try to draw a distinction between exempt private cars, light and heavy vehicles, certain veteran and classic cars and bits of military equipment would be extremely complex administratively.<br><br>
To give the Committee an example, under the current proposals, an ex-military personnel carrier owned by an enthusiast with seats for six people would be exempt, but if an otherwise identical vehicle had space to carry ammunition, it would be classified as a goods vehicle and be liable to pay £150 a year. If the vehicle had a gun fixed to its top, it would count as a "burden" and would again result in a £150 payment. Not only are those anomalies unfair to enthusiasts, but it is extremely difficult for the postmistress in the village concerned to try to sort out whether the vehicle standing outside falls within the exempt class.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that his announcement will be good news and welcomed by Harrods and Fortnum and Mason which own several elderly vans and lorries which will qualify for the concession?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. I could provide another anomalous example, a 25-year-old Morris Minor—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I apologise but I had to go out to make a phone call. My colleagues and I were expecting a debate on clause 14, but it appears that we are debating clause 15. Have I made a mistake?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are on clause 14.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Harrods?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether Harrods is relevant but I must confess to having an account with them, which can be dangerous these days. I know nothing about the company beyond that. We are debating clause 14 and I am sure that the Minister was in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in order because although I know that Harrods' vehicles are not propelled by steam, I am announcing that steam driven vehicles falling under the more-than-25-year-old category will be entirely exempt, not simply liable to the duty rate specified in the clause.<br><br>
I was about to tell the Committee about another anomaly relating to steam driven vehicles. Under the Bill as drafted, a 25-year-old Morris Minor would be exempt but a steam driven car built at the turn of the century and still in use—clearly machinery of great value and interest—would be liable for £35 a year vehicle excise duty. The Committee generally will regard that as unfair. We intend to correct that anomaly in a later clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely clear whether we are talking about elderly vehicles that are steam powered or elderly vehicles that are not. Will the Minister please clarify?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I made it clear in my opening remarks that I was referring to non-commercial vehicles of all types—steam vehicles, which are the subject of the clause, and more widely. I am not sure that Harrods' vans fall into the non-commercial category—unless they are held by enthusiasts and driven non-commercially, they are still liable for tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister has run out of steam.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not clear from the Minister's statement what the current tax rates are for steam driven vehicles below the age of 25 as specified in the clause. What are the current tax rates for those vehicles?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely complex, which is why we want to simplify. Steam powered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
vehicles fall into different categories. Steam powered agricultural vehicles such as traction engines were classified in the special concessionary group and paid only £35 prior to the proposals. Steamrollers, however, were classified in the special vehicles group and liable to £150 VED if they weighed over 3.5 tonnes or, if they fell in the private and light goods category, the VED was £140 a year. So there was a range, which we aim to simplify. Now, under the clause, if vehicles are over 25 years old they will pay nothing; and if they are steam driven they will pay £35 a year providing they are less than 25 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister giving way to save each of us getting up and making separate speeches.<br><br>
The proposal would mean that newer and new—should new vehicles be constructed—steam driven road rollers, for example, will have a lower rate of tax than diesel driven steam rollers. That will create an incentive for manufacturers to consider changing from diesel to steam if the technology can be found to do that. There may well be an environmental consequence if the fuel that they burn is more polluting than diesel. Have the Government considered that anomaly and the possibility that it may encourage the use of a less clean fuel?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can assure the Committee that no manufacturer will start building and selling steam driven road rollers to win a comparatively trivial annual advantage in vehicle excise duty. Even if people could be persuaded to buy them, the cost involved in maintaining and running them would overwhelm any duty advantage. I think that I can assure the hon. Gentleman about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on that concession. It brightened up my day and will certainly make a lot of difference to my constituent, Mr. Richard Cusworth, who wrote to me in a state of high dudgeon. He is the owner of a 45-year-old fire engine and takes it out about 12 times a year to village shows and fetes. Until the Minister made his announcement, he would have had to pay an increased rate for his old fire engine. What happened in the past? My constituent, who follows those matters closely, told me that up until a few years ago all serviceable fire appliances were exempt from road tax. Is that the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to take advice about what the duty rate was in the past. I am glad that our relieving measure has been welcomed by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
VEHICLES CAPABLE OF CONVEYING LOADS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is clause 15 the same as clause 14, in that it corrects the error that was made in last year's Finance Bill when vehicle excise duties were changed?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
Clause 15 provides that heavy goods vehicles used privately and unladen or for driving tests will be charged at a special vehicle rate and the lowest rate of duty normally used for heavy goods vehicles respectively. The rate in both cases will be £150 and the previous rate was £140. That will cover the 30,000 HGVs that fall into that category.<br><br>
The clause highlights an environmental question. Is it sensible to allow people to use large HGVs as private vehicles? In what circumstances could they possibly want to do that? In doing so, they would pay vehicle excise duty at only £10 more than that paid for a car.<br><br>
I have examined the clause carefully. The lower rate for private use is confusing. Does it mean that if somebody uses a heavy goods vehicle to go shopping in and parks it in Sainsbury's, they will pay vehicle excise duty at the lower rate for private use? If the Paymaster. General is to be as helpful with this clause as he was with the previous clause, perhaps he can explain why this exemption needs to be introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), I have a constituent who is unclear about the Bill, especially clauses 15 and 16, which he thinks might relate to his circumstances.<br><br>
I wish to raise the question of agricultural tractors. My constituent wrote to me on 7 December and his letter made me examine this part of the Bill in more detail that I might otherwise have wished. My constituent was a little confused about the Bill and wrote that he would appreciate my comments. He specifically asked whether the restriction applied to older farm tractors and added that he had heard on the radio that there was
<br><blockquote><p>"a 3½ ton cut in or cut out point."</p></blockquote>
He had not got all the details, but noted that a tractor's weight can vary a great deal depending on whether it is unladen, has a front loader, carries a plough or draws a large trailer, and whether that trailer is full of crops. My constituent wrote that some of the old Fordsons that he has
<br><blockquote><p>"may hold a plough weighing upwards of one ton",</p></blockquote>
while
<br><blockquote><p>"a big beet trailer could be fifteen tons."</p></blockquote>
I understand that my constituent has an old County tractor used for forestry extraction. There are no forests in my constituency, but my constituent is involved in the business. He wrote that the old County tractor is
<br><blockquote><p>"really the rear ends of two Fordsons, bolted together with articulated steering".</p></blockquote>
He considers that, "fitted with a winch", the County tractor is "a phenomenal beast." My constituent went on to talk about having a 1968 Massey-Ferguson 135
<br><blockquote><p>"with a 40 type loader",</p></blockquote>
but I think that that comes under the next clause.<br><br>
I wrote to my constituent and said that I did not think that either clause 15 or the subsequent clause applied to him. Although I said that he would pay what he normally paid, I have not got a clue how much that is. Can the Minister enlighten me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is no. I regret that I do not have definitive answers to questions based on a half-understood radio programme and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0266">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
filtered through the hon. Gentleman's intermediate exposition. I shall certainly try, however, to answer them if the hon. Gentleman will write to me. Even better, if the hon. Gentleman can get his constitute to write to my officials, I promise that I shall get to the bottom of what is taxed under what circumstances.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) sought clarification about clause 15. The clause ends an anomaly which meant that certain privately used heavy goods vehicles are classified as private and light goods vehicles. A court decision drew attention to the anomaly and we are duly correcting it. However, we are looking at vehicles that are either owned privately or used unladen or for training. The Committee will agree that it would be unfair for us to tax as ordinary heavy goods vehicles lorries that are used to train drivers, for instance. Such lorries are driven about without a load and are not used for transport in the normal sense. They will therefore incur the lowest rate of vehicle excise duty for any such lorry, which is £150 a year.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 9, line 32, leave out "25" and insert "35".<br><br>
The amendment seeks to change the arrangements for the exemption of classic cars. The clause provides that cars, vans and motor cycles more than 25 years old are exempt from vehicle excise duty. There are apparently 150,000 company-licensed vehicles over 25 years old and there is doubtless a significant number of roadworthy unlicensed vehicles of that age.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
Why was a 25 year cut-off point chosen? We think that that is too low for the definition of a classic car. The design of many 1960s vehicles is such that they are acceptable as an everyday means of transport; many are in reasonable condition and still used. We need to examine the issue closely. I tried to find commentary on why 25 years was chosen and what proportion of the 150,000 proposed vehicles would be excluded if the age were set at 35 years. I also wanted to ascertain the difference between a classic car and a cheap, old car. I looked through the reports on the matter—unfortunately, someone had removed the copy of <i>"Classic Cars"</i> magazine from the Library and I was not able to study its comments. I presumed that the copy is currently being used by Members of the House of Commons classic car club, one of whose members and two of whose honorary secretaries have had much to say in welcoming the proposal.<br><br>
Given the Government's desire to be considered an environmentally friendly—even if not an electorally friendly—Government, the target age of 25 years is questionable. If abolishing car tax on such vehicles encourages people to keep highly polluting vehicles on the road, it would defeat the aim of the exercise. The Government could have chosen to list the cars that they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
felt came into that category rather than using a blanket age. We referred earlier to Morris Minors; I had one for several years and can confirm that they are excellent cars, but I never considered them to be classic cars. Maybe I should have kept that car; I would not now have to pay excise duty.<br><br>
The member of the House of Commons classic car club to whom I referred, the Government Deputy Chief Whip, has a car for every decade of his life. They sound excellent cars; some of them are parked in the Members' car park. That, however, is no reason for setting the age at 25 years. We think that it would be more reasonable and prudent for the age to be increased to 35 years. We should examine the impact of that and then reconsider the question. That would be more sensible than creating an incentive for people to keep old bangers on the road, thereby polluting our cities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to my right hon. Friend that he resist the amendment with all his might. The hon. Lady does not fully understand that the amendment would exclude from the benefits of the tax change announced in the Budget—and I very much welcome clause 16—all those splendid vehicles that were produced in this country and, indeed, abroad between 1961 and 1971.<br><br>
I realise that the hon. Lady is far younger than the rest of us, and therefore does not have memories of such classics, but I should tell her that people in my constituency and elsewhere who collect and enjoy old cars—there are such people throughout the country, including my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who is not unknown for his Bristol cars—would be offended if models such as the Aston Martin DB4, DB5 and DB6 were not able to benefit. Offence would be taken if Morris Minors were not able to benefit—the hon. Lady has already referred to them. I should declare an interest: I have driven a Morris Minor for a considerable time, and an excellent car it is.<br><br>
There would be offence at the exclusion of E-types; the Alvis TV21; and some of the early Minis, which are likely to become part of the industrial archaeology of this country, and are still going in their modern form, as the hon. Lady will know. I should also add the MGA and the MGB, a model that should commend itself to the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), as many were built at Abingdon, near his constituency. We might consider the last of the Wolseleys and the Rileys, the Lotus Elan, the Austin-Healey 3000 and others, the Ford Anglia, the early Cortinas, the Triumph Herald and the GT6.<br><br>
I could go on, but my point is that during the whole of that era—the 1960s—many excellent motor cars were produced, especially in this country. All those people who own such cars and keep them on the road, for large mileage or small mileage, warmly appreciate the change made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor. I am also sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. Butler) appreciates the strength of my argument. I urge my right hon. Friend strongly to resist the amendment from one of the younger members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some trepidation to support the comments by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South. I worked on the E-type and Mark II Jaguars. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I also represent a Coventry seat, which contains arguably the best motor museum in the country, and I have a neighbour who has lovingly restored two Mk. 2 Cortinas, one of which would come under the terms of the exemption now and the other of which would do so in a year or two.<br><br>
An exemption set at 25 years will mean that the benefits are felt not only by the lovingly restored Mk. 2 Cortinas that are owned by my neighbour, but many other Cortinas and Capris, for example, which are being driven around through our cities and which are highly polluting vehicles with many thousands of miles on the clock. Do we want those cars to be in everyday use? That would be the effect of setting the limit at 25 years.<br><br>
Slight prejudice is involved. Many people are investing in cars that they hope will be worth money at some time in the future. At the moment those are not classic cars, and their owners are using them regularly and extensively. They are often well-heeled country types—possibly Conservative Members of Parliament or their spouses—who will benefit from the clause.<br><br>
A few months ago the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders asked the Government to consider a proposal that people should be encouraged to trade in their old cars at 10 years, and that they should be given a £500 incentive to do so. The argument, which in part stands, was that there has been a massive improvement in vehicle technology over the past 10 years. There is a substantial difference between the environmental impact of cars produced today and those of 10 years ago. The proposal, it was said, would lead to a considerable reduction in exhaust emissions in our cities.<br><br>
The Government rejected the proposal, and I do not argue with that decision. The case was worth making, but I understand the Government's reluctance to become involved in offering incentives for trade-ins on old cars. Yet the clause encourages people to keep in daily use cars that were made in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Large numbers of such cars are still on our roads. Many of them are in disgraceful condition and are heavily polluting our streets. The clause would provide a tax incentive for them to continue to do so.<br><br>
By moving to the 35-year barrier proposed by my hon. Friend, we would achieve what the Government say they are seeking to do. We would genuinely protect classic car owners who use their cars on the odd occasion, but keep them principally because of their enthusiasm and desire to collect, not as an alternative to buying a decent car that would have far less impact on our roads and the air quality in our towns and cities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, for the reasons set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth). In the light of the discussion, the matter has become more difficult for me. I am not a car expert, but other members of the Committee clearly are.<br><br>
Will the Paymaster General agree to consult widely on the matter? In particular, will he consult the House of Commons classic car club? I should be grateful if he would undertake to do that, because no one else has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
been able to contact the club. The vintage and parentage of that organisation is quite different from that of the cars that it represents. Everyone disclaims all knowledge of that group, but I am keen to contact it because it is so generous in its praise of its members.<br><br>
Immediately after the Budget statement, the club issued a press release thanking the right hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight)
<br><blockquote><p>"for his untiring efforts to bring this concession about".</p></blockquote>
The press release goes on to say that the right hon. Gentleman
<br><blockquote><p>"made forceful representations to the Government on behalf of all classic car owners and we are delighted that these have been successful. For the first time we have a Chancellor who appreciates the needs of the vintage and classic car movement".</p></blockquote>
That was attributed to the work of the right hon. Gentleman and his influence as the Government Deputy Chief Whip. I should like to be associated with a club which praises its members so generously. Unfortunately, I cannot contact the club, nor can anyone else.<br><br>
Some 25-year-old cars are just old bangers. Students and other people in my constituency drive 25-year-old cars which should not be on the road; they discharge pollution. A more sensible limit would be 35 years.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fail to see why the Government wants to subsidise car fetishists as a matter of public policy. I should like to make two points in support of the amendment and the speeches of my hon. Friends.<br><br>
One of my constituents, Mr. Roy Laban—a professional, experienced tree surgeon—owns a number of old tractors, as hon. Members will know. He also owns a number of old Land-Rovers. In a letter to me, he wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would occur to me that were an old vehicle, such as a Land-Rover over twenty-five years old, and due to its `meccano' construction, a vehicle could be built, using a new chassis, new and old parts as required, maybe the later coil suspension and keeping the `old' registration, it could be legally on the roads tax free. Has this been considered?"</p></blockquote>
I pass on that question to the Minister.<br><br>
More importantly, notwithstanding the fact that many old cars cause serious pollution, I should like to raise the issue of kit cars. As many hon. Members will know, kit cars are frequently built using parts of old cars. In my constituency there is a major manufacturer of sports cars called Westfield Sports Cars—the premier kit car maker. It has written to me expressing much concern about the new 25-year-old rule. Many kit cars are built on the basic chassis of a Ford Escort Mk. 2, which can be slightly more than 25 years old.<br><br>
I asked the Department of Transport to clarify the rules on old registrations which will influence the amount of abuse of the 25-year rule. The Minister replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under the registration rules applied by the DVLA, a kit-built vehicle is allowed to retain the registration mark of the donor vehicle provided sufficient major components from the original vehicle are used. Vehicles constructed with major components from a number of vehicles are allocated Q marks, whilst those made of all new parts are issued with current marks. Each application for registration in these circumstances is considered on its merits."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0268">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
That sounds fine and straightforward. However, as hon. Members who either own kit cars or know about the industry will understand, much importance is attached to having original registration, rather than Q plates, on such cars.<br><br>
Many kit cars have registration plates that are more than 25 years old. The 25-year registration rule could be abused as significant numbers of kit cars could be built using old registration plates and, therefore, could be exempt from vehicle excise duty. I am not pretending that that is a major reason why people decide to have kit cars, but an industry is there that will seek to take advantage of that. We have to ask whether there should be legislation that favours what are, in effect, brand new cars, but which have old number plates. I should like the Minister's assurance that he will examine that and close any loophole that exists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a mean-spirited amendment. When my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor announced in his Budget statement that he intended to exempt from vehicle excise duty all private vehicles that were more than 25 years old, there was a roar of approval, not only from my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East, but more generally. On the basis of that proposal, the DVLA has already refunded the duty to the owners of such vehicles. The Opposition now want to claw back that concession from the 100,000 owners of classic cars. I am very surprised that the amendment was tabled not just by the Opposition spokesman but the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East who clearly knows a good deal about the luxury end of the car industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to classic cars. How many of those 100,000 cars are just old bangers now on the road that have not had to pay taxes? Does the Minister know?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the old banger point. It is our intention to exempt not just the obvious vintage and veteran vehicles but those that fall into the classic vehicle class, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman). To hear the Opposition, one would think that all the owners of those elderly vehicles are the better-off, but it is quite the reverse. Many of my constituents who own and run vehicles that are more than 25 years old do so on extremely slender means because they are genuine enthusiasts. They will not relish the proposition that they should be penalised by the reversal of a highly popular proposal announced by my right hon. and learned Friend in his Budget statement, on which we consulted widely. We were given universal encouragement to pursue that age exemption.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South proposed exempting vehicles not by age but description. I have heard batty regulatory proposals from the Labour party in the past, but I have never come across one as stupid as this one. How on earth could any Administration try to distinguish the marque, model, engine size and type down to the smallest detail that would have that privilege, while others were caught because they fell
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
foul of those descriptions. It is far easier simply to exempt vehicles beyond a certain age, as we have done. The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) talked about the problem of old bangers, against which he clearly wants to pursue a vendetta. That is a strange position for the Labour party because many of them are owned by motorists on lower incomes. If they are driven, the cars will still have to pass the MOT test and the required emission standards. It is wrong to categorise all such cars as necessarily environmentally damaging. Many of them are owned by enthusiasts, so it is quite impossible to distinguish—and therefore exempt—those that are owned by people who are interested in them for historic and classic car reasons, while taxing the rest.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) raised the question of kit cars. I am not able to answer him today. As he asked, I will look into the matter, but I shall just observe that exactly the same problem would arise under the amendment. If there is an incentive to cheat in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggested, it would exist whatever the age limit.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to reject this mean-spirited amendment, which would withdraw a highly popular and valid concession that has been enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of our constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there had been wide consultation. When and in what circumstances did he receive representations from the right hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight)? Were they made in writing? Will he include them in the correspondence in the Library, so that we can all benefit from the consultation that took place?<br><br>
We are told that the 25-year limit will affect 150,000 classic cars. The Paymaster General has just told us if we added 10 years and made the limit 35 years instead of 25 years, 100,000 cars would be removed from the concession. So we now know that only 50,000 considerably older cars—cars that we would agree to be classic—are benefiting. The Paymaster General said that 100,000 vehicles had already benefited from refunds.<br><br>
I point out that that does not represent huge popularity in a country with many millions of car drivers. What is more, ownership does not follow the equation: one car, one person, as we know from the experience of the right hon. Member for Derby, North, who I believe owns four or five such cars.<br><br>
We request that 35 years be the cut-off term for environmental reasons and for reasons of prudent use of taxpayers' money. The Government have utterly failed today to distinguish between old and classic cars, and have assumed that 100,000 cars built between 1960 and 1970 that benefit from the concession are classic cars. We shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asked about consultation. About 23,000 letters were received in response to the consultation paper about how to reduce vehicle excise duty evasion. That paper stated our intention to continue to provide the concession, which was overwhelmingly supported by those 23,000 respondents.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0269">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
As I said, if the amendment were passed, about 100,000 vehicles would be returned to the tax system. So 100,000 vehicle owners and all of those associated with them now know that the Labour party is opposed to their hobby and to what they intend to do. If they had the intention of voting Labour at the next election, I am sure that they will not do so now.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two technical questions for the Paymaster General. They both relate to subsection (1), which refers to cars that were manufactured 25 years before the date in question rather than when they were first registered. It is easy to establish when a car was first registered because that is noted on the registration document. It is extremely difficult, however, to establish when a car was manufactured. It may have been manufactured months or, indeed, years before the date of registration. Will the Minister explain how the Government intend to arbitrate in cases when owners of such vehicles claim that the cars are older than the date of first registration?<br><br>
Secondly, if my reading of subsection (1) is correct, on 1 January each year all cars aged between 24 years and 24 years and 364 days will be eligible for the exemption. Will the Minister say what the provisions the Government are making for the taxation of the vehicles aged between 24 and 25 years—their last year of taxable life? For the sake of argument, if the date on which a vehicle licence was renewed was 1 October, its owner would want a licence for three months—the minimum period—rather than for six months. Will the Government allow vehicle owners to tax them for the remainder of the calendar year in which tax is levied? If not, what arrangements are the Government making for paying refunds that will be applied for on 1 January each year? Is not that a foolish date on which to process refunds?<br><br>
Although 1 August is the most common day in the year when people buy new cars and, thus, tax them for the first time, the second most popular day is 1 January because the car can be registered one year later.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
Therefore, January is a month in which there is a particularly high number of applications to license cars for the first time. People regularly license thereafter on an annual or a six-monthly basis and a high number of cars are registered each month. Surely it would be administratively more sensible for the Government to choose almost any date other than 1 January or 1 August each year on which to make the refunds payable. It should be a month on which the burden on staff who license cars is lower than it would be on the date that the Government have chosen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should also like to deal with refunds. A constituent had one such vehicle and he wanted to know how he could get a tax refund. He contacted the tax authorities and was told that he would be sent a claim form. A few days later, no form had arrived, so he telephoned and someone else told him, "You have to write in." He wrote a letter, but again heard nothing. He telephoned again a few weeks ago and was told that he need not worry because everything was done automatically—the numbers of vehicles over a certain date were simply being registered by computer. He was more than a little confused about the exact procedure to deal with the matter. I hope that the Minister will clarify what my constituent should do because my constituent and I are not the only people who are confused—the officials are too. I hope that the Minister is not confused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first point of the hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) concerned the date of construction. That is not a problem—two dates are significant in regard to construction. Cars that were constructed before 1947 have until now benefited from a concessionary rate of vehicle excise duty of £70. Motorbikes that were constructed before 1933 benefit from a £15 rate. The Bill would sweep those measures away and make such vehicles exempt. Using the date of construction has, therefore, not been a problem in practice, and vehicle enthusiasts' clubs are able and willing to provide dating certificates where appropriate. We are simply continuing an arrangement that works well in practice.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about exemption arrangements. Those are already in operation and work well. The hon. Gentleman did not seem to be complaining that people had been unable to get exemptions. They will be liable to license to the end of the year. Owners of vehicles that are taxed on 1 January will be given refund applications by the DVLA. The present arrangements will, therefore, continue, and I anticipate no difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have misunderstood my first point. On 1 January this year, cars that were constructed before 1 January 1961 would be exempt. If I owned a car that was first registered on 1 February 1961, I might argue that it was manufactured two months beforehand, at the end of December the previous year. It would, indeed, be surprising if the car had been manufactured on the day that it was registered. The legislation does not tackle that problem. A number of classic car owners would argue that their cars meet the criterion in subsection (1) in that they were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0270">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
constructed more than 35 years before the operative date, even though they were first registered thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. He is worried about the accurate date of a car's construction. On cars of that generation, it was always the custom for a serial number to be stamped in the metal somewhere under the bonnet by the engine. From that serial number can be deduced the date of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, whose intervention may deal very well with the past generation of cars. However, does the same rule apply to cars being manufactured now? We are making a law that will stand for many years. If the date of manufacture cannot be determined from a serial number stamped on part of the chassis, we are making a problem for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the date of construction is a factual event. It is possible to determine it, and my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington was helpful in describing one way in which that is done. Certainly, enthusiasts' clubs can help: such clubs have already supplied certificates in cases where there is a degree of doubt. However, if a person claims an exemption on the basis of a different date, that date has to be determined. If documentary evidence can be provided that a certain construction date renders the vehicle liable to an exemption, the DVLA will respond accordingly.</span></p>

LICENSING AND REGISTRATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 and schedule 1 bring in a number of changes in the procedure for the licensing and registration of vehicles under the Vehicle Excise and Regulation Act 1994. The purpose of the changes is to reduce evasion of vehicle excise duty and to enforce the requirement governing registration and transfer more effectively.<br><br>
We do not disagree with that objective. I want to use this stand part debate to raise the question of evasion that can be dealt with easily and which is known about but which is not pursued, presumably because of lack of staff. The National Audit Office report published on 10 January this year entitled "Vehicle Excise Duty, Evasion and Enforcement" detailed the extent of the problem which this clause is supposed to counter. It also contained proposals for continuous licensing.<br><br>
The report found that the amount of lost duty rose from 3.5 per cent. of revenue collected in the priod from 1984 to 1989, to 4.1 per cent. in 1994. That is a considerable loss of revenue. However, it also notes that in the past four years 30 per cent. of the offences
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
reported and received by DVLA had not been pursued. It reported that 23 per cent. of those cases had not been pursued because the forms had not been properly completed by either the police officer or traffic warden concerned. That loss in itself represents £13 million of revenue.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
It also identified a long-standing problem—the number of reports received that do not include the name of the vehicle keeper or driver. Such unnamed reports represent 70 per cent. of all evasion reports received, but the amendment does not deal with that. I understand that in 1993 there were 700,000 discarded cases, where evasion was clearly identified but not pursued.<br><br>
Problems arise with incorrectly collected information and the inadequacy of the database, which hampers prosecution for other traffic offences as well as the ones that we are talking about. The Government's proposals for continuous licensing will not help the failure to notify the agency of, for example, a change of address. We think that the requirement for a fee to be paid for a replacement vehicle registration certificate when the original has been lost or damaged would remove people's incentive to bother re-registering and replacing the document. That would then lead to problems if they are apprehended.<br><br>
The aims of clause 19 and schedule 1 are laudable. However, given the detail in the National Audit Office's report, it is clear that the Government must address the problem of understaffing at DVLA. At the moment, there are too few people to pursue evasion when it is reported. They must also clarify, assist or advise—whatever is necessary—the police or traffic wardens on exactly what information the DVLA needs to trace the car and its driver or owner and thus be able to deal with the evasion. If they do not do that, the objectives of the clause will still not be achieved.<br><br>
Will the Paymaster General comment on those points? The report makes others, but I will not delay the Committee by detailing them. I am sure that the Paymaster General has studied the report closely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that far too many people evade the payment of vehicle excise duty. The loss currently runs at some £163 million a year. That is why the Government have put forward proposals to crack down on that public nuisance and in particular, to address the most common form of revenue loss—so-called "month skipping". Someone whose vehicle excise duty runs out in, say, January leaves it pretty late before he thinks of applying for a replacement. Then, if he is well into the next month he thinks that he might not renew it until the start of the subsequent month, or even the one after that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that very point, can the Minister explain how those evaders have been traced and how he knows that month skipping is going on? It is not clear from the information that was available to the National Audit Office or in information that is available to the DVLA who those evaders are, how they manage to skip a month and whether it is a significant problem for the collection of duty.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have told the Committee that it is a significant problem. That is known from the number of people caught doing it and from the suspiciously large numbr of renewals requested a month or two late. Therefore, the Government have proposed a system of statutory, off-road notification. If owners genuinely want to take their cars off the road or scrap them, they should notify the DVLA. If they make such a declaration and are then caught using their cars, a penalty will apply. If they do not make an application or declaration, they will be liable for vehicle excise duty continuously from when the previous licence expired. The clause gives effect to that.<br><br>
The other problems mentioned by the hon. Member for Bristol, South are a matter for my right hon. Friend

the Secretary of State for Transport, who is responding to that report. The clause will go a long way towards ending this form of evasion, which is far too prevalent.</span></p>
