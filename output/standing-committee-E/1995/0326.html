	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill stands, it contains a promise by the Secretary of State to bale out profilgate or incompetent trusts or health authorities. I do not see that the Committee is being asked to do anything less than let that pass. The Secretary of State is guaranteeing to pick up the tab for trusts and authorities that he closes down or which collapse before he can intervene. We are lucky, at least until the Bill has gone through Parliament, inasmuch as a promise is not an open-ended commitment. However, I suspect that if the Secretary of State has his way, he would be prepared to offer the earth in his attempt to restart the stalled private finance initiative in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament is lucky inasmuch as unauthorised borrowing by NHS bodies is limited elsewhere in law to £5 billion. Although that is a strange kind of luck, it allows us as legislators to say that at least outside organisations must stop spending when they have run up £5 billion worth of debt at the taxpayers' expense. In view of what we have said in our debates, that would also happen without our agreement and, in particular, without Parliament's agreement. Therefore, we are discussing a major commitment and the amendment would ensure that we have the ability to control such a commitment to public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unamended, the Bill effectively gold plates the PFI inside the NHS. It guarantees returns on contracts for the provision of private finance as a replacement for the public-fund capital projects. That guarantee will be made by the Secretary of State under clause 1 and backed by the force of law, however inappropriate, mishandled or against the public interest and the better provision of health care the contracts in question might be. Trusts can run up debts—liabilities—and they should be checked by Parliament or even by the Department—but from what we can gather, there will be no checks. That cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There still is, in name at least, a national health service and it should be accountable to Parliament for its services. As it stands, the Bill diminishes parliamentary accountability. Unless changes are made—the amendment seeks to make them—Parliament will have approved legislation that might cost up to £5 billion and over which the Government have no effective control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to restore that which should never have been given away. We propose a mechanism by which Parliament has a chance to speak before it signs the cheques. The mechanism would allow individual Members of Parliament to have a say, and they will necessarily have greater and more in-depth knowledge of the problems and the potentials of local health service bodies. That knowledge might be far greater than that of distant Ministers and NHS executives who claim stewardship while denying responsibility. The amendment also provides a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
mechanism by which proper and effective scrutiny of the spending and borrowing plans of health service bodies is brought back into Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One feature of the so-called NHS reforms has been the dwindling of direct accountability and its replacement by an appointed quango. The amendment seeks to limit the rise of at least one segment of that expanding army of the non-accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is planning to assume an absolute responsibility for the liabilities of health service bodies if they merge, are absorbed, are dissolved by him, are abolished by him, if they go bankrupt or otherwise come to an end. I give such an exhaustive list because the phrase "ceases to exist" remains obscure. The Secretary of State will assume that his responsibilities for the liabilities can be lessened by transferring some or all of them to the health service bodies that succeed or replace those that have, for whatever reason, terminated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those liabilities may reach £5 billion. Under the existing terms of the Bill, those liabilities will not have been approved by the House. They will not be approved by Members of Parliament in any way even though we, and the taxpayers who elect us, may be ultimately responsible for picking up the tab. We should be in no doubt that we will be responsible for picking up the tab, either directly through the Secretary of State or indirectly through reduced budgets to other health service bodies. We plan to rectify that situation. Subsection (3) of the amendment would mean that all such liabilities incurred by national health service bodies would first have the approval of the relevant Secretary of State and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide a simple and precautionary measure that would help to prevent prolifigate and unhelpful spending by health service bodies. It would also help to detect and curtail unfair deals with private contractors and to bring about a degree of strategic investment in new or improved health service provision. More importantly, the amendment would give Parliament a say in the spending and borrowing that it may ultimately end up financing. Such a say is sadly lacking in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the right of Parliament to have its say would not be limited in the first instance to Ministers. Members of Parliament would also be able to look at proposed financial initiatives by health service bodies and would be able to object to such plans should they so wish. Those provisions are contained in subsection (3)(b) and (4), which provide that a minute of liability be laid before the House of Commons 14 days before any approvals are given by either the Chancellor or the Secretary of State. Hon. Members may object to that minute if they have cause to do so. Their objections may be considered—and, if thought wrong, waived—by the House before any approval decisions can be made by the Secretary of State and the Chancellor. The proposed subsection (5) makes that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
We are not proposing a brand-new procedure—it already exists in Parliament. Currently hon. Members may object, through the exact same procedures as the amendment proposes, to Treasury minutes that deal with certain categories of liabilities. Only a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Health made provisions relating to the reallocation of debt from the seven trusts that he has already dissolved. In the jargon, that is called the reallocation of originating capital debt. To complete the procedures, the Treasury had to agree to the reallocation and to a remission of certain outstanding debts. Our amendment proposes the same necessity for Treasury consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the Treasury was required to lay before the House a minute dealing with the Secretary of State's proposals, including exact monetary amounts. That minute was subject to the exact same procedures for objection that we detail in the amendment. Our proposal is nothing new to Parliament. It is an extension of existing procedures to the incurring of debts before they happen rather than limiting those procedures to the redistribution of debts after they have been run up without agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would provide a straightforward and transparent way to deal with important and costly proposed liabilities. It would give the House a role and allow health service bodies to seek approval for their plans in a much more structured and accountable environment. The amendment would realise the Bill's intention of securing the confidence of a potential private finance partner. The Bill will not achieve that aim. It may raise the spirits of private contractors briefly, but potential PFI bidders and banks will consider the longer-term scenario, that we discussed in our last sitting. Banks will realise that the Bill proposes an unfair contract, which gives health service bodies too much scope for action, while restricting Government manoeuvrability. Therefore, it may not pass the detailed scrutiny of our legal brethren.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Health has been panicked into introducing the measure. It has known for some time that the PFI in the national health service was in trouble. The problem was identified in the autumn of 1994, when Newchurch and Co. claimed that there were anxieties about the Secretary of State's power to dissolve trusts and transfer liabilities. However, the Department of Health had other matters to worry about. It stuck its head in the sand and hoped that the problem would go away—an action for which the Government are famous. But the problem did not disappear and the Bill was introduced. The Secretary of State has been forced to push through an emergency measure. Departmental incompetence is the sole cause of the emergency. The sole effect of the Bill will be to deny the basis of PFI in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is passed unamended, it may cause chaos in public finances for years. Future Parliaments will take a dim view of the decision to allow almost unhindered access to public funds. It is worrying that the Secretary of State even contemplated the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
I hope that the Minister will explain in detail why our amendment will not be accepted. It is not enough for him to claim that it is unnecessary—he must explain what procedures exist to prevent taxpayer exposure to a £5 billion bill. That explanation was not given on Second Reading but it should be provided today. What methods are open to hon. Members to question local health service bodies' spending and borrowing? The majority of hon. Members keep in contact with their local health services. I used to have at least three meetings a year with the health authority. Nowadays, I meet the health authority and different trusts regularly to discuss their provision for my constituents' access to the health service. Hon. Members should be able to question the spending and borrowing plans of local health service authorities. The Bill would leave no check on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should explain why the bill does not give the Secretary of State power to scrutinise spending plans and to veto them if appropriate. It is incredible that a Government who talked for years about the need to keep a steady rein of finances now say that they are prepared to write off liabilities of £5 billion accrued by trusts and other health service bodies without ascertaining how those debts were run up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to extend the measures for tackling the transfer of liabilities in the NHS, but the extension should be accompanied by proper checks and balances in the new system that should include parliamentary scrutiny and accountability, for which the Bill does not provide. Different trusts, which are independent from the NHS Executive, can run up bills for billions of pounds. We will have to accept the responsibility without having any real check, as individuals or Members of Parliament, on how those debts will be run up and whether they are in the interests of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, I sat through a session of the Public Accounts Committee, which was taking evidence from the NHS chief executive on a national audit report about the goings-on in what was the Yorkshire regional health authority. For two hours we heard about the shameful things that have happened to public moneys after the so-called cultural changes in the national health service, which started with the 1990 reforms. I have no doubt that the Public Accounts Committee has not finished taking evidence on that subject. I hope that it will go into greater detail about what has happened to public finances in that particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Minister and all members of the Committee that we cannot let people who are using taxpayers' money in such ways have their head over this cultural change as they did before. People in the Yorkshire regional health authority thought that they could take decisions, ignore rules laid down by central Government and do what they believed to be right. They misused hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money. I do not want those consequences extended to all trusts, and the only way to stop that is to make sure that the Bill does not include carte
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
blanche acceptance by the Treasury that it will write off any liabilities incurred by trusts within a limit of £5 billion nationally. It would be wholly wrong for the Committee to allow that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I—and, I hope all members of the Committee—want to know what checks and balances will be put in place if we are to accept £5 billion-worth of debts and liabilities drawn up on the public's behalf by the so-called independent trusts resulting from NHS reforms. I am not convinced that the Executive will have a check on the actions of NHS trusts. I remain unconvinced that there will be proper accountability to the public if we do not amend the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more that I consider the Bill, the more I am convinced that the Government are making a fundamental error. The Government support the private finance initiative, as does the Labour party, because they want to transfer risk from the public sector borrowing requirement to the private sector, yet in the Bill, the Government seek to underwrite some of the losses that the public sector might incur if it enters into a project and takes risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In last Thursday's sitting, the Minister correctly made the point that private sector capital is always more expensive than public sector capital. From the taxpayers' point of view, the only justification for using the PFI would be that the Government would transfer risk from the PSBR to the private sector. However, the Bill will let the private sector have its cake and eat it. It says, "We want you to use your more expensive capital for NHS development, but we don't expect you to take the full risk that you would take if you were making a private sector investment in a private sector business."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party supports the principle of the PFI and, as I said last week, it would be extraordinary if we did not, as it was the Labour party which pressed for years, before the Conservative party joined in, to change the Ryrie rules on public investment to allow leasing schemes and partnerships between the public and private sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three key differences between the Government's approach to a PFI and the approach that I favour. First, unlike the Government, I do not see the PFI as a covert way of slashing capital spending. Secondly, I do not believe that the PFI is equally applicable to all public services. I made the point last week that the Government need to set clear priorities. The PFI is spluttering along and has not really come to life because the Government have not defined what they see as the key priorities for investment, to give the private sector a steer to where it would be most appropriate to form deals with sources of private finance. Thirdly, the Labour party sees the PFI as a basis for building partnerships between the public and private sectors. It is not a means of substituting private investment for public investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a sound basis for the caution that my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) sounded about how the PFI is applied to the NHS. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
do not argue that it should not be applied. In earlier debates we highlighted several areas in which PFI investment would be entirely welcome and would enhance the NHS, but the range of opinion urging caution goes much wider than the Labour party. Will Hutton, economics editor of 	<i>The Guardian,</i> wrote recently.
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the PFI cannot leave the character and ethics of the NHS intact."</p></blockquote>
A survey by the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales found that 63 per cent. of NHS chief executives—almost two thirds—believe that using the PFI for clinical practice would fundamentally alter the ethos of the NHS. I can emphasise that point by quoting a writer whom I consider one of the wisest of the 20th century, George Bernard Shaw. In his preface to the play "The Doctor's Dilemma", Shaw wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That any sane nation, having observed that you could provide for the supply of bread by giving bakers a pecuniary interest in baking for you, should go on to give a surgeon a pecuniary interest in cutting off your leg, is enough to make one despair of political humanity. But that is precisely what we have done. And the more appalling the mutilation, the more the mutilator is paid."</p></blockquote>
That comment, written before the first world war, could apply now to the PFI. I do not suggest that a private sector partner in an NHS investment will be paid for amputations by the inch, but the Government's principal indicators to measure NHS efficiency are to do with response times and throughput. Time and again, we are told by Ministers that the case for NHS reforms rests on throughput in the NHS—the number of finished consultant episodes—is higher than ever before. Each year, the number increases. The Government are measuring NHS efficiency against quantity of care rather than quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should measure NHS performance against not the number of procedures undertaken but the effect of health interventions on the health of people. The Government are not doing that. We know the proportion of ambulances that reach heart attack patients or get them to hospital within a specified time, but we do not know what proportion of ambulances get patients to hospital alive. Surely that is the most important measure. We should not look only at the number of people who arrive at hospital alive, but the number who emerge from hospital to live a full and healthy life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States has a privately financed health care system and its health interventions are hugely higher than in the United Kingdom. It spends twice as much of a larger per capita gross national product on health than this country, but Americans do not live longer than we do—in fact, they have a lower average life expectancy. More treatment does not necessarily improve health, yet clinically based PFI contracts will largely be measured on quantity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dividing line between those PFI projects for the NHS that I would support and those that I would not is that between clinical and clinically related services,
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
and support services. At face value, that has the Secretary of State's support. In his speech on PFI to the Royal College of Physicians on 21 November, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is no part of the government's policy to transfer the delivery of NHS clinical services into the private sector. The PFI is about the provision of the supporting facilities."</p></blockquote>
I agree with every word of that, but—it is a big but—two paragraphs later in the same speech, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some Trusts have explored local arrangements for private sector provision for some clinical and clinical support services. That is a matter for local determination."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State cannot have it both ways. He is either in favour of applying the PFI to support services in the NHS or of it being applied more widely. If the Government said that their policy was the former, and amended the Bill to make it clear where the PFI would be used in the NHS, I would support that—But the Government have not made it clear, which is why the amendment is so important. It would give Parliament the option to approve taking liability for some schemes but not for others. Later amendments, also draw that distinction and would mean that the PFI could be applied to the NHS, but now willy-nilly to any scheme. We must be careful that by applying the PFI to the NHS, we do not destroy its public health care ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at our previous sitting, I understand that to date 44 PFI projects for and within the NHS have been approved, of which 11 are financed for clinical or clinically related services. Thus, one quarter of the projects are in what I regard as the danger zone. It is possible to go ahead with PFI projects in the NHS without entering that zone. Ministers, supported by members on both sides of the Committee, are trying to get the PFI up and running and to make it work. Surely, then, they should concentrate on projects outside the danger zone. The cash split is not quite three to one—£60 million of £165 million to date commited to PFI projects in the NHS has been spent on clinically related contracts. That is a generous estimate. I suspect that the actual figure is slightly lower, but a number were hybrid schemes, including some clinical and some clinical support services, and my figures did not differentiate between them. Perhaps one third of the money has gone on clinical schemes. There is plenty of scope to make the PFI work without entering the danger zone.

Nick Bosanquet, who is a health economist and professor of health policy at Imperial college, London, warns—and I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will heed the warning—that the PFI will create a new breed of what he calls "private sector rent-seekers", who will have a vested interest in driving up public spending to maximise returns on their capital. With investment in the national health service at its present level of £165 million, the leverage would be pretty small, but the Government intend private finance as far as possible to replace public finance in the NHS, which would mean that that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
proportion would rise over time. It would fairly soon reach the point at which the pressure for increased public spending would no longer come just from the public—or, as the Government like to present the matter, from public sector workers—but would come, in its most forcible form, from owners of private capital who had invested in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—whatever our views about the best size for the public sector, and what its priorities should be—know that it is important for Government and Parliament to control public expenditure. Far from using the risk element in PFI deals to control—like a governor on a machine—the speed of the PFI, the Government have stripped away control, and that will magnify the problems. It is the job of Parliament to scrutinise Government in all matters but above all, on behalf of the public, to ensure that taxation is providing what the public want. We do not do that very well and need to to better. We need, in Parliament, to hold the Executive to account—above all on its spending decisions. The Bill is a blank cheque and Parliament should not approve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is all about safeguards. My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley described the safeguards with respect to the parliamentary process contained in the amendment, which would ensure far wider consultation than that envisaged in the Bill—under which all responsibility would rest with the Secretary of State. I hope that the Minister will take the amendment seriously and recognise that there is a need for wider approval, in the circumstances envisaged in the Bill, than would be required as the measure stands. The amendment would provide a mechanism for a sensible procedure by which to exercise wider parliamentary scrutiny and necessary consultation. My hon. Friend was right to say that most hon. Members are in contact with their local trusts, community health councils and, often, practitioners, and that they take an active interest in the health affairs of their constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether, in the longer term, providing the right safeguards—both for Parliament and for the private sector—will prove difficult with the private finance initiative. It might be difficult matching the two. We have to devise a mechanism that allows to move ahead those things which Parliament wants to move ahead, but does not write a series of blank cheques to the private sector, whose perception of some of the problems suggests that it would like an even blanker cheque than that which the Government propose in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State made the safeguard clear when he opened the general debate. The first thing he said was that the Bill is needed, in a hurry, because of the problems that had arisen. He took the view that he could be trusted to make decisions about transfer because he was the Secretary of State, and that the private sector did not need to worry. Problems have arisen not because the private sector felt that the Secretary of State could not be trusted—his
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
trustworthiness has come under much greater scrutiny in the past week for other reasons—but because it wanted the Bill clearly to state that the statutory position was that the liabilities would be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, I talked to the chief finance officer of St. James's hospital trust when I visited a constituent on Thursday. I was told that the trust was not aware of the Bill until it was brought forward and that, as far as its particular contract was concerned, it was not a relevant factor—though he accepted that the Bill would become relevant if it did not proceed smoothly through the House. Its bank—Charterhouse bank—had not anticipated the Bill and, before knowing that it was in prospect, was prepared to sign. Now that it is aware of the Bill, it will study the situation more carefully, but the chief finance officer had no reason to think that anything that Parliament did was likely to upset what was going to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also took the opportunity to talk about the facility that was going to develop. The scheme would clearly not receive the approval of my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley), because it clearly stretches into clinical services—it involves the provision of surgical wards and facilities for oncology for cystic fibrosis and a good deal of paediatric work. The chief finance officer said last Thursday that he would accept car parking as suitable for the PFI to produce, but I do not know whether he would take that view of the in-patient hotel facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked whether that facility would be available to NHS patients and was told that it would; 35 beds would be reserved for private patients but, otherwise, the facilities would be enjoyed by all patients under the agreement. In fact, there would be a particular benefit to the people in the ward that I was visiting—patients who perhaps needed a period of convalescence during which less intensive nursing was required, but who could not safely be released from hospital into their own care or that of someone else. The chief finance officer saw the scheme as a satisfactory outcome, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for York said, it is important that the NHS has control of the way in which it uses on-site facilities. The chief finance officer saw the danger and he accepts that discussion is taking place as to the future of the St. James's hospital trust. The Minister knows that its future is under active discussion, and I understand from the chairman of the Northern and Yorkshire regional health authority that a move is being made to merge the two trusts in Leeds. Some aspects of that may be beneficial, but the creation of a large trust that covers both the Leeds General infirmary and the St. James's trust may be worrying in other regards. We need to analyse the consequences of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief finance officer did not think such a move would affect the contracts. He felt that, under any circumstances, the hospital on the St. James's site would remain and that there was no possibility of that site not remaining in hospital use. Therefore, the facility on that site would remain at least for the 25 years it takes before one reaches a break clause. After
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
that, the property will revert to the hospital trust. The chief finance officer was not concerned about the possible merger of trusts on those grounds, but we need to consider it on a different basis from that by which we consider a PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister satisfied that the current safeguards are as he would wish them to be or is it reasonable for him to consider mechanisms that involve wider parliamentary scrutiny? Wider scrutiny would give Members of Parliament an opportunity to express their views on what may happen in their areas. That is particularly important when one considers that the private sector is less than happy with the provisions available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the March edition of the 	<i>Parliamentary Review,</i> Mr. Philip Bretherton of the company Berwick Leighton writes an article in which he talks about PH problems in the NHS arena. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the article. Various issues are raised by someone from the private sector who was, and still may be involved, in the PFI work at the Royal Berkshire hospital. The final paragraph of the article is headed "Lack of leadership" and it follows Mr. Bretherton's description of a series of problems in the way in which PFIs are working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister will be able to answer all the worries expressed by the private sector. The more worries that he is able to address, the more important it is that there is wider parliamentary scrutiny than such a Bill can provide. It merely asks to place a tick besides various issues without too much additional thought. The issues mentioned in the Mr. Bretherton's article demand wider parliamentary scrutiny than we can legitimately give to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from the final paragraph of the article, which is headed "Lack of leadership":
	<br><blockquote><p>"Very few guidelines on important and complex issues are being published by the Treasury or the PFI panel. The Treasury takes the view that to do so could stifle private sector innovation. Some of the issues requiring clarification have already been mentioned"—</p></blockquote>
in a moment, I will give the headings of the paragraphs that deal with those issues
	<br><blockquote><p>"but there are other significant ones such as the level of volume risk which has to be assumed by the public sector. While the need to allow the private sector to use its expertise to develop schemes without a straitjacket is clear, the process could be significantly speeded up if the leadership was given on specific issues which are known to be problematic."</p></blockquote>
Those specific issues include the need to readvertise if the bid is unreasonable or much higher than was originally envisaged. Examples include
	<br><blockquote><p>"a private sector bid coming in at double the estimated cost referred to in the OJEC notice"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the private sector solution proposing a totally different site for a hospital project which may lead to a need for re-advertising and starting the whole process again."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
Those delays would cause great difficulties in the private sector. One can understand that, whether one takes a public sector or private sector view of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other issues are covenant status, bid costs and compensation on termination. The latter is of interest in considering the Bill because the issue is not public sector termination, but what might happen if there is a private sector termination. Other aspects of the Bill are mentioned—the operation of market testing, capital charges and asset disposal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tenor of the article is that the private sector would like every dot and comma to be in place before it will undertake a project. It is concerned that if difficulties arise during the project, none of the additional costs should fall on it. It is not possible to underwrite such projects without more thoroughly considering the necessary parliamentary process, rather than simply lumping together the liabilities and putting them to the Secretary of State in one go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important because another point that came out of my discussions at St. James's is that the project will go ahead because it will get the necessary signatures. It could not possible have gone ahead without the use of the private finance initiative. It is clear to those at St. James's that if one wants to undertake a major health service development, it must be done through the PFI because public sector finance is not available at the required level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have moved beyond a position where the PFI is one of the mechanisms enabling capital programmes in the health service to go ahead, to one where the PFI is the only mechanism whereby such capital developments can proceed. The PFI is, therefore, of more serious concern because the private sector is less inclined to participate in some projects than others. If we limit capital development to the private sector, we will skewer developments in the health service in an unacceptable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hospital trusts are examining methods of raising income through the disposal of assets. I have witnessed such processes for many years. But it is worrying if trusts can continue to dispose of assets as they deem it appropriate, but can create new assets only if they involve the private sector. I welcome the project in Leeds. However, there are two causes of concern, which could become matters of public debate if the PFI is the only way forward. The Minister has visited Leeds and may be aware of the two matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue relates specifically to Leeds. The Leeds review of health care services seems to favour altering planning for services in Leeds. In view of that, should a facility be created in south Leeds? Members who represent constituencies in south Leeds have pressed for a facility on the south side of the city. Building a facility in south Leeds is a less attractive proposition for the private sector than building on one of the existing sites. There is a strong case, however, for more even distribution of services in the city, especially in view of traffic patterns and the location of the two existing hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
The second concern is about oncology services, a shake-up of which will take place in Leeds. There are very good facilities at Leeds general infirmary and at St. James's. Radiotherapy for Leeds and much of the surrounding area is provided at Cookridge hospital. During the next few years, that facility will be moved to the city. The current plan is to move it to the LGI site. If the Government fulfil the recommendations of the Calman report, which was supported by the Select Committee's report on specialist cancer units, the preferred solution for the Leeds area will be to create one specialist unit. The most likely location is the LGI, but it could be based at St. James's, or even elsewhere. It is important however, that the impetus for applying the Calman report recommendations to the area is not lost through the private sector's desire to develop in one place rather than another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it will be some years before the radiotherapy unit leaves Cookridge, I should like the Minister to examine the urgent need for additional machines there. There is a waiting list problem for those who have had surgery and are waiting to start radiotherapy. It is important that that is considered, not neglected as an immediate problem because of longer term issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should ensure that PFI initiatives do not skewer other decisions that needs to be taken in the health service on where facilities are needed in the city and the region. Leeds serves the wider region and, as we know from widely publicised cases, frequently serves a much wider area. The facilities should be considered according to the needs of the entire area. The PFI must not dictate how things happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need seriously to consider giving Parliament, through the Chancellor and hon. Members, the chance to give the closest scrutiny to proposals as they come through. Therefore, I commend the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tomorrow, I expect my local health authority to fire the starting gun on a £57.6 million capital investment plan, which is intended to be funded through the private finance initiative. It is axiomatic that the health service requires more money in my constituency. I want more money spent on health care provision in Dudley borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have strong reservations, however, about how the capital investment plan has been conducted and about consultation in the borough. In particular, I am concerned about the extension to Russells Hall hospital being built with private finance. I question the economics. A maternity unit that cost £7.5 million fewer than seven years ago, a special baby care unit that cost about £3 million and a regional plastic surgery unit recently upgraded for £5 million—initiatives totalling more than £15 million—will, where they can, be unscrewed and moved.

I am worried that is what will happen under the PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question the economics, when £15 million can be thrown away, a hospital site can be sold for private housing and money can be invested in an unpopular local hospital. The hon. Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge (Mr. Hawksley) is in favour of the plans. He questioned me about the 30,000 people locally who are against them.

The issue is securing value for money for the public purse. I am not convinced that the current management and financial management of local NHS trusts are best placed to do PFI deals, supported as they are by a limited number of middle-ranking secondees from the private sector as part of the PFI unit and in view of the resources available to the NHS regionally and nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
The 	<i>Financial Times</i> reported the construction company John Laing criticising the private finance initiative as having lost all impetus, because there is insufficient support in Government circles to break the bureaucratic barriers. I am worried about that and, more importantly, I question the capability of the Government and NHS trusts to negotiate deals that ensure value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) has made some good points this morning, as he did in his speech in Committee last Thursday, which I read in 	<i>Hansard,</i> as I could not be present. Although we on this side of the Committee support the private finance initiative, we believe that PFI projects should be prioritised, as some areas of public sector provision are more appropriated to PFI funding than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In transport and public housing projects, where there is a clear income stream from fares at the ticket counter or rent, for example, the PFI system can work. In the national health service, however, that is not necessarily the case. When we talk about securing value for money, we must understand that the PFI switches a capital outlay for an income stream over a certain time, which the Government commit themselves to pay to the private sector. It is not clear that amortising capital in that way is necessarily a good deal for the public. The NHS finance manual states on the subject of borrowing, at paragraph 10:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Trusts are able to borrow from the Secretary of State or commercial sources. However, like all parts of the public sector they are required to demonstrate they are getting good value for money."</p></blockquote>
Quite correct. The passage continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Borrowing must therefore be on the best terms available and it is unlikely that, in practice, Trusts will obtain better terms than those available through borrowing from the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has accepted the argument that the cost of borrowing in the private sector is higher than that of Government borrowing. In that case presumably the benefits of private finance are a matter of the Government's wanting to switch immediate capital expenditure and so reduce payments, with amortisation over a certain period. In effect that will be mortgaging the future, as the arrangement will have to be paid for in the future and, it will be accepted, payments will be more over such a period. There is no financial benefit in that course. The only possible benefit of private finance would be from improved management—an operational benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point, and he has reminded me of an aspect of borrowing on which I should like him to comment. Under existing legislation, trusts are no allowed to borrow from abroad, but it seems likely that under the PFI, a foreign company or a firm from a foreign country could own the property on which a trust relied, such as a hospital. Does it strike my hon. Friend as strange that trusts could not borrow abroad but that ownership abroad could be allowed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government accounting in the national health service contains several anomalies, some of which my hon. Friend adumbrated in previous sittings. It is a nonsense that it will be possible for hospitals to be owned by foreign companies, which will be able to borrow from abroad, because they are in the private sector, while, clinical services will be operated—it is to be hoped—by the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as I was saying, there are no financial benefits in any absolute sense from the package arising from the private finance initiative—only timing differences affecting when the Government make payments of money—the case for private finance rests on the idea that introducing the private sector will improve management efficiency. The Government fervently believe that, but we should clearly understand what is being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for PFI, certainly in my constituency, is rather tenuous. It rests on the claim that the private sector could manage the day-to-day operation of non-clinical services more efficiently than the public sector can. That means that there could be fewer private sector managers of non-clinical services in a PFI-run hospital, and Labour Members have argued that the NHS has too many managers and that the Government have got their priorities wrong. Some savings may be made in that respect, but it is more likely that the costs of the private sector running non-clinical services will be paid for by non-clinical staff. Fewer porters and fewer ancillary staff will be employed and there will be downward pressure on wages in an already low-paid sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described what a privately run national health service regime would involve. It would not be good news for the vast majority of people who work in the service and it would do nothing for their morale. That would be bound to have an effect on patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should contain greater safeguards to ensure that value for money can be obtained for the Government and for the public purse. Such safeguards do not appear in the Bill. That is why I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee long, but I have been brought to my feet by the comments that my next-door neighbour, the hon. Member for Dudley, West, has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dudley proposals are a useful example of what a PFI can do. The proposals were introduced and very few local people would have expected the Government to offer finance of £57.6 million for health projects. It is a wonderful way for the Government to support what a local trust is doing. As well as the PFI being able to pay the capital cost, £7 million will go into improving community services. That is one of the scheme's great advantages, and it is interesting to note that the scheme was proposed not by politicians, but by the medical profession themselves. The profession said that the scheme should go ahead and that money should be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Dudley, East in supporting the proposals in principle with some suggestions for improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West spoke about private facilities and suggested that the PFI application would mean that private wards would be used at Russells Hall. I assume that the chairman of the trust, Mr. Peter Suddock, has reassured the hon. Gentleman in the same way as he has reassured me. Mr. Suddock said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ian Pearson has been saying that PFI will include private beds at Russells Hall. The plans do not include any and with private facilities at Birmingham and Wolverhampton under utilised",</p></blockquote>
he believes that such a proposal would not be in the commercial interest. I hope that that assurance means something to the hon. Member for Dudley, West and that he will accept that private facilities will not be provided with PFI money.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some brief questions that relate to the substance of the amendment. First what does the Minister believe are the current duties, of if any, of the trusts, health authorities and special health authorities to consult about any of their borrowing? Secondly, what duty do they have to heed responses to any consultation that they carry out? Thirdly, if there is no duty, what, if anything, does the Minister intend to do about that? Fourthly, and most importantly, what should we do about the ridiculous situation at present, in which it appears that the only remedy for inadequate management of health authority accounts, if the line of command of accounting officers does not deliver the goods, is an investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General after the event? That is shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather, for example, that there does not have to be any consultation on the series of financial processes surrounding any of the developments that we have heard about today. I stand to be corrected, but my understanding is that the financing of Philip Harris house was not subject to consultation and that there was no requirement for the public to be given an opportunity to express their views. I have raised that issue with the Minister before. I gather that the borrowing by the Wessex regional health authority, which ran into difficulties over computers, was picked up after the event. There is a considerable problem
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
involving computers in the Greenwich health authority, where £40 million has been wasted, the equipment is dud and the order was flawed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need some assurance that we shall do better than we are now doing. One of the best ways of making sure that public bodies, particularly those as large as the health service, do not waste money is to have their borrowing, especially their substantial borrowing, open to scrutiny and subject to independent advice. That is particularly important because trusts meet in private and no information can emerge until after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek confirmation of whether the exercise is carried out entirely behind closed doors, with only civil servants ever being able to do any current or contemporaneous monitoring, or whether there is a proper form of public scrutiny, particularly of borrowing. If there is not, I should like to know why, and ask the Minister, if he believes in open government, to make sure that the health service is far more accountable, not least in how it raises and spends significant sums of public money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Horam)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

I understand that issues must be hyped up, but his question was legitimate and fair and I think that I can reassure him if we can go step by step through the controls; an opportunity that we did not have on Second Reading or during the first two sittings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first statutory duty on a trust is the overriding requirement to obtain value for money in all its actions. It is an overriding duty because trusts are run by managers who, by and large, want to use the money that they are given sensibly and wisely. Hon. Members who know their local managers would not think that they would try to do otherwise. They do not wilfully or obviously try to get themselves into difficulties. Indeed, they have a professional pride in running a good ship. They are criticised locally if they do not, and nationally as we have seen in the case of Yorkshire. They can be put before the Public Accounts Committee and so forth. There is no doubt that that is an overriding, and appropriate, statutory duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are various negative controls. First, there is a positive incentive to manage assets faithfully and well in the public interest. Combined with that, there are the negative controls; for example, a trust may not move into a charge even though it has it as a security. It may not borrow in non-sterling without express permission. The Secretary of State must guarantee loans from people other than himself. These are negative controls and are in statutes. They have a bearing. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Rother Valley has mentioned on several occasions, there is a specific aggregate borrowing total of £5 billion, which is mentioned in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that, as part of that negative control, permission would have to be sought from the Secretary of State for each trust to borrow from the £5 billion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is the total in the Bill, which is the maximum for aggregate borrowings of NHS trusts. Trusts do not act collectively. It is not the business of trusts to ring round other trust managers to work out whether they can exceed the Government's limit. Trusts manage their own businesses and, as part of the control on them, must submit to the NHS Executive a figure for their external financing limit that can be agreed to by the Treasury, the NHS executive and so forth. Trusts cannot exceed that limit without permission. That EFL is a key element in controlling borrowing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what he said about any loan not being made by the Secretary of State having to be approved by the Secretary of State? Does that apply no matter how small the loan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there is a de minimis, though I forget the figure off hand. It is quite low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EFL, agreed by each individual trust and set out in financial plans lodged with the NHS Executive and known to all their boards, is the specific control that has a bearing on the point we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, from a written answer, that the current EFLs for trusts were put in the Library last week. However, Members would be interested to know whether, once those limits have been agreed, the Secretary of State's permission is required before trusts can borrow or spend money within the EFLs. I know that the annual EFLs are agreed, but are trusts then allowed to take decisions on their own before they reach the limit? Clearly, they cannot breach it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly they cannot breach the limit; that is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can they spend up to it without permission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They can, absolutely. That is why the limit is agreed. Far from being £5 billion, the amount outstanding at the moment is about £1.7 billion, which is, in effect, working capital cash flow that the trusts have collectively within their EFLs. That is a control on individual trusts, and it is the performance of trusts that matters. The amount outstanding is normally well below the aggregate £5 billion that the hon. Gentleman has seized on as it does not need to reach that level. At the moment, it is about £1.7 billion, a total well below £5 billion. I can also tell him that the sum of borrowing from commercial, non-public sector sources is as low as £41 million. The hon. Gentleman can see from the figures that his concern that, somehow, a huge debt would be built up without anyone knowing is a chimera that could not come to pass, not only because the external financial limits are fixed in advance and have
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
to be kept to—the hon. Gentleman agreed on that—but because they are monitored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely unlikely that trusts would breach the limits without anyone knowing, because it would soon become clear that the EFL was being broken. In such circumstances, a trust would be investigated by the NHS executive. In any case, the financial figures are monitored quarterly and, if the NHS executive found that a particular trust was causing a problem, there could be monthly monitoring in special circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman can see that the possibility of someone borrowing irresponsibly and profligately is virtually non-existent. It is subject to a plethora of controls—management control, external financing control, monitoring control—which is very stringent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), there is a need to subject the matter to external audit. The finances of each trust must be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is under a duty to examine and certify them. That is the external investigation. It is not wholly a matter that he or the trust managers and the NHS executive would be examining—there is for each trust an external procedure through the Comptroller and Auditor General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that contemporaneous or after the event?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I get back to the course of those matters, let me reiterate the point about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned: too much scrutiny might take place after the horse has bolted. Some of it will, because, inevitably, one does not discover until a little way down the route that things have been done irresponsibly or badly. One cannot always construct a system, in the private or public sector, in which everyone acts with perfect propriety and responsibility. Mistakes are made and, in some instances, will not be discovered until later. It is only proper that there should be a system, through the Comptroller and Auditor General, through which such mistakes should be discovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onus of managing all the assets properly rightly falls on the trust managers of the day but, given the controls under which they work and the obligations that they have, there is very little chance of them behaving irresponsibly as opposed to making honest mistakes in the way that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lennox-Boyd) wants to make a point and I have probably given way too much to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rother Valley and the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey pointed out the need for parliamentary scrutiny, as did the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South. Only yesterday, the chief executive of the NHS, Sir Alan Langlands, was in front of the Public Accounts Committee, precisely because there had been a problem in the Yorkshire area. The chief executive was reporting to the PAC on how that had been handled. In fact, it had been handled very well. The National Audit Office pointed that out in its investigation into the way that the NHS Executive had dealt with those difficulties. That is perfectly proper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The NAO report did not establish the fact that payments were approved by the lay watchdog chairman of the regional health authority. The purge of health authority members that took place in 1990 means that members are no longer appointed by a range of bodies, which include the Government, local authorities, doctors, local medical committees, voluntary organisations and trade unions. That has led to a reduction in accountability. What are lay, non-executive members of health authorities meant to do if not to ensure that NHS money is spent legally and for the purposes for which Parliament voted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rather wide of the subject that we are considering—accountability to Parliament, which the hon. Member for Rother Valley and other members of the Committee raised. Trusts have an obligation to behave properly and sensibly with public assets, to identify and outline a clear plan, including EFL	<div class='sub'>s</div> <!-- sub -->, to monitor the plan quarterly—monthly, if necessary—and to provide for external auditing. The chief executive of each trust can be summoned before the Public Accounts Committee to explain anything that may have gone wrong. That is a considerable battery of controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do we get rid of a chief executive or chairman who is incompetent or has misused public money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He can be sacked in the normal way. It is possible to make redundant or dismiss any executive member of a trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress to the hon. Member for Rother Valley that there are extensive controls. They should reassure him that no serious possibility exists of the Bill changing the levels of borrowing that occur naturally in NHS trusts. Borrowing will continue, mainly for sensible cash-flow reasons, from the public sector, but almost never from the private sector. Any trust manager who is worth his name will keep borrowing to a minimum because he will not want to incur interest unnecessarily. He will want to ensure that the money is used wisely. It is in his interest to keep borrowing to a minimum. A rogue elephant would soon be discovered by the procedures that I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
The hon. Member for York said that there was insufficient risk transfer in the PFI process. The Bill provides for appropriate risk transfer. The private sector will shoulder only proper commercial risk. It may overspend in building a new project, or include too many maintenance costs, and thus be unable to perform satisfactorily against contract. Those are proper commercial risks that the PFI hands to the commercial sector. But it is not reasonable to ask the commercial sector to bear the political risk of a future Secretary of State deciding to wrap up a trust and abolish its liabilities, so that those who have contracts with it receive no return and lose their investment or income. The private sector should bear appropriate risks, but we should not put it in a position of having to bear unnecessary and unaccountable political risks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be suggesting that the Secretary of State might wind up or merge a trust on a political whim. Clearly, that will not happen. The only circumstances in which a trust would be wound up or merged would be if it went broke, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) said. If that is the position, it may be a trust's obligation to make payments under the PFI deal which was the cause of it failing to make the proper financial return and therefore being wound up. It is absurd that a PFI partner whose rent seeking could cause a trust to fail financially would end up being the preferred creditor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Secretary of State may decide to dissolve a trust and exercise his power not to deal with its liabilities, but under the Bill he must deal with its liabilities. It would be wrong of him not to discharge those liabilities in such circumstances. The hon. Gentleman's point does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point in favour of the PFI, which he said that he supported; that is not always the case on the Opposition Front Bench. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms Harman)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear what the hon. Gentleman said in support of the PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the Labour party's approach was superior in three respects, and I agree with most of what he said. The PFI is not equally applicable in all areas; some will be more susceptible to that approach than others, and time will tell which those are. Roads, and possibly railways, are interesting examples of PFIs, and I believe that health will be of substantial interest for such projects. We could argue about which areas will be important for PFIs, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that not all are equally appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to build up the public and private partnership, and that is precisely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
what the Bill does. As he said during our previous sitting, there is a mixture of public and private effort behind many projects and we want to promote such creative amalgamation and joint endeavour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said, too, that he was worried about the clinical considerations and warned about considering only clinical quantity rather than quality. I agree with him; I direct him to the interesting report by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland on clinical outcomes indicators in Scotland. I wonder if the hon. Gentleman has seen that report—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, and I have asked questions about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are doing some interesting work in England, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to be patient. We hope this year to take consultations on clinical outcome indicators incorporating added value, which the Scottish indicators do not. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the matter is of considerable interest and importance. The Government are examining it carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South wanted to be reassured that the safeguards are as reasonable as we would wish them to be. I hope that he was here earlier when I went step by step through the various controls on borrowing. They are reasonable; I would not want them to be tighter. They work now, there are no problems associated with them, and I do not anticipate any problems as a result of the Bill. I genuinely am not in the least worried about safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South also made a couple of points about the St. James's project, as an example of the PFI. I do not want to become too involved in discussing specific examples because they lead us into rather parochial dialogues, but I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Leeds review has led to an interim report favourable to the kind of project that is going ahead at St. James's. Of course, I cannot comment on the final report, which has not yet appeared. It will, however take into account such matters as the oncology issues that the hon. Gentleman drew to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) was effectively answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge with respect to the local issues that he raised. He also made a general point about the PFI—to the effect that we believe that it will improve efficiency and management. We do believe that it will. Indeed, the extent to which it has already done so can be seen in the analogous sphere of market testing, which in practice means contracting out facilities—usually support facilities in hospital—to the private sector. We reckon that a saving of between 20 and 37 per cent. usually results for the taxpayer from that procedure. So far the national health service has saved about £1 billion since market testing was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey asked whether a trust would consult about borrowing. Indeed, it would. The point of an EFL is that agreement would be reached before the beginning of the year on the borrowing limit to be imposed. The trust could not decide on its borrowing without being subject to that constraint. That external factor would limit the trust's activity. There would be sufficient external constraints on what a trust could do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That information would reside with the Government and with officials—with the Department of Health, centrally or locally. However, there would, I deduce from the Minister's answer, be no consultation of the public, the community health council or anyone else, except within the service. That was the burden of my question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which is the subject of new clause 1, I remind the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the Comptroller and Auditor General—not only the management—sees all the borrowing and financial information. Another factor that should be taken into account is the community health council consultation, where there are significant changes in service provision. Two avenues of consultation on financial aspects and standards of service exist outside the decision making of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disadvantage of the amendment is that it would impose a bureaucratic and long-winded process on the relevant procedure. For example, under the amendment all contracts of employment and all supply contracts would have, first, to be approved in writing by the Secretary of State, secondly, to be approved by the Treasury, and thirdly to be approved by the House under the minute of liability procedure. Unless the hon. Gentleman wants to confine the provision to large projects—that would be invidious because of determining a cut-off point—it will apply to everything from the supply of potatoes, as was mentioned on Second Reading, to supplies for an entire new hospital. Everything would have to go through a triple procedure, which would be enormously expensive, bureaucratic and time wasting. It would add months and years to the delays about which the hon. Gentleman has complained. It would not be practical to add extra burdens to the procedure. Everything would be slowed down excessively. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the Minister is familiar with Treasury minutes. The Treasury minute that dealt with the dissolution and refinancing of the seven trusts was an example of the normal practice used when a Government Department proposes to remit the repayment of a sum of more than £20 million. Such a method currently exists when the Government write
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
off about £20 million. That is a paper exercise for Treasury purpose and it does not cover every small project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister outlined the reasons for the current checks in the system. I accept what he said about external financing limits being monitored, but I would like to think that the public purse cannot be prejudiced in such circumstances. However, it can. Although the Minister said that the Government monitor the agreed EFLs for individual trusts, he did not say that decisions taken within those limits are seen by the Secretary of State. In fact, the Secretary of State does not consider such expenditure. I accept that the current level of external financing is less than £2 billion, but statute agrees that it could be more than £5 billion. Parliament would not take a decision about that because the Secretary of State could increase the overall limit without having to come to Parliament. The amendments were designed to allow hon. Members and Parliament generally to question what may take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of current controls and checks on borrowing. I am not a lawyer so I am not sure whether there is an overriding statutory duty on trusts or national health service bodies to obtain value for money. One one occasion, I listened for two hours to the extraordinary story of how the former Yorkshire regional health authority had not looked for value for money. Its approach to outsourcing is an example of that. I would call that privatisation, but the vogue word is outsourcing. It covers those tasks that were once carried out by a health authority, but which are now done by the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into great detail, but the Yorkshire case involved services in Leeds. The chief executive of the national health service said that it was clear that the public did not get value for money. The report stated that about £300,000 had been lost, so it would have been cheaper to have kept the facilities in house. However, ideology meant that the services were outsourced at great cost to the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to a statutory duty, but where is the duty to ensure that the public get value for money? I would like to think that we get value for money when decisions are taken by independent bodies, but we did not get it in the Yorkshire case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise this issue because it directly relates to the second category mentioned by the Minister, where the external auditors would pick up problems. Before that there is a stage at which the internal auditors of any trust or body which reports on annually should pick up on value-for-money issues, as well as many others in the report. Unfortunately, the internal auditors in the old Yorkshire regional health authority did not pick up misdemeanours. Officers increased their management grades three days before they took redundancy. If that had not been stopped, the public purse would have had to pay those people £22,000 in lump sums and increased annual pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The internal auditors did not discover that misdemeanour, and it was many months before it was
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
discovered. Is that value for money? The internal audit is outsourced; the internal auditors are Peat, Marwick, McClintock, which is a reputable accounting firm. It did not discover the calamitous misuse of public money that is clearly laid out in the report. I cannot understand why the police have not been called in to examine some aspects of the report. Page after page of problems are laid out. They were not picked up until the external auditor discovered them; in some instances, years after some of the practices had taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After reading the report and listening to the evidence given to the Public Accounts Committee yesterday, it seems that the National Health Service Executive, although it is not its fault, does not know what is happening inside different trusts. If the internal audit does not discover problems, how can we be confident that the executive will?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the external auditors eventually discovered problems, and I am pleased that they did so. However, we are still agreeing to use the public purse to write off liabilities which can be agreed within EFL limits without the permission of the Secretary of State. Those sums could run to more than £1 billion. I have no doubt that the vast majority of those liabilities will be accrued fairly and sensibly, but what happens if some are not? Are we saying that, as a Committee, we shall write off such liabilities, in the way that we will presumably write off some of the decisions of the old Yorkshire RHA, which cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept some of what the Minister says about having control of the overall EFL	<div class='sub'>s</div> <!-- sub --> in trusts, but we cannot say with any confidence whether what happened in Yorkshire before the authority's dissolution was or is happening in other health authorities. I have grave fears that we shall effectively open up the public purse to misuse in the way that was highlighted in the report and that we, as parliamentarians, have no checks other than those mentioned by the Minister this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence taken yesterday by the PAC will be with the House of Commons for a long time and will determine what happens next in that particular case. I shall not pursue the amendments now, but we may table them at a later stage. The whole House can then discuss whether we, as guardians of the taxpayers, have sufficient control over decisions that trusts can make about the liabilities that they can accrue on our behalf.

Yet the Committee has been told that clinical services will not be contracted out. Before we accept a clause that relates to north of the border, it is incumbent on the Minister to explain why an arrangement made in Scotland will not serve as a model for south of the border.

The purpose of the new clause is clear. It would include in the Bill a duty to consult before the transfer of assets occurred. The Minister made it clear earlier that the Bill did not include a duty to consult representatives of local people. There are only three external processes that currently operate. The first is the prospect of bringing in the Comptroller and Auditor General on behalf of the public. The second is
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
an annual general meeting of hospital trusts. In my experience, such meetings are cursory affairs. The Guy's and St. Thomas's trust in its first year told almost nobody of the meeting—no one had any paper beforehand—and in the second year it took out one advertisement, sent in a day or two before the meeting, in the local newspaper. The meeting was conducted in an unsatisfactory way, but we had assurances from the chairman that it will be "better next year". I will believe it when I see it.

The third is the opportunity for a community health council to consult, but only if there is a substantial change in services. Of course, there might be no substantial change if services X, Y and Z are transferred from trust A to trust B. A court could decide that there had been no substantial change and only a change from one provider to another. Therefore, that would not fall within any consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in current legislation states that there should be consultation. The health service is a closed shop at the moment. It is probably one of the most secretive areas of government, second only to the Ministry of Defence. That it is a closed shop is unacceptable. The Government got rid of local health authorities, which had an indirect representative function. Now, there are health commissions. Again, members are appointed and there is no direct access to them. A great many of their meetings take place in confidential sessions, especially when they are dealing with anything to do with finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Usually, anything to do with finance in a public body is locked away, if possible, in a confidential minute and appears on the pink or purple papers at the back of a document. Of course trusts meet in secretor can the Minister tell me that some meet in public? I understand that the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts would be happy to meet in public and has a policy to do so. That is its view, and I can assure the Committee that is what the public want. I do not understand why the Government are resisting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would do the Government some belated credit and the public a service if the Minister, who has been in his post only briefly, could persuade his colleagues that two things, which would help enormously in bringing confidence to the local health service, should happen. First, health bodies should always meet in public with no items confidential, apart from tenders for contracts, which have to be private. Secondly, there should be on such crucial matters a consultation process that includes local representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to an earlier debate in Committee about the initial legislation, in which it was said that if a trust were to be set up or dissolved, there would be consultation and a document would be produced to which certain people or bodies—community health councils are one—had the chance to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the health service is only technically accountable through the House, the least that we can ask is that Members of Parliament are written into the system as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
consultees, formally. The new clause, in generalised terms, allows the Minister to give varying responses, but I hope that out of the debates in Committee and on Report, we will receive undertakings that Members of Parliament will be formally consulted on all matters—that there will be a fair deadline between the consultation document going out and the responses coming in; local community health councils will continue to be consulted; and local authorities, certainly councillors for the area in which trust premises are located, if not the local authority, will also be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will respond. We live in a country that has a huge amount of secretive government, but this is the national health service, paid for and used by the taxpayer and accountable, in theory, to the taxpayer and his representatives. We should all be consulted about important issues relating to the dissolution of trusts and the transfer of debts, assets or liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, Mr. Hill, I shall be brief. I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey, particularly about undue secrecy within the NHS among trusts and, to a lesser extent, district health authorities, over contracts and deals and all the other things on their agendas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise a few points that have been taken up already in the hope of a different response from the Minister, and to draw from the Minister responses to questions that he has not yet answered. First, the Minister did answer the question about the NHS Executive working on contract, but he used ambiguous language. I think that we should have a model PFI contract from the NHS Executive for trusts to take on board. I asked the Minister to consider that and to let Members—not least myself—have a copy of a model contract before Report. There is no need for secrecy and we should see that on which the NHS Executive is working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister has referred to trial and error in contracts. Today, he talked about honest mistakes. I fear that we may expect many of those over a long period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Surely we are still talking about new clause 1. Disabuse me if I am wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are indeed, Mr. Hill. I am talking about the need to inform people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consulting people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Bill is enacted and before any trust makes a PFI contract, a draft of that contract could go out to consultation, at least with community health councils. We could thus ascertain whether there were any serious flaws that would cost the taxpayer dear. That is directly related to new clause 1, and I ask the Minister to consider such a procedure. That process would not be unduly bureaucratic, or take up a lot of
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
time, but it might draw attention to flaws in future contracts and could save taxpayers' money in the years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and I shall pay regard to it when I read the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of the Committee's proceedings. I shall do likewise with the more straightforward points about consultation made by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey. I can reassure him that there is a statutory obligation on dissolution or transfer of an asset for consultation with the community health council. Although I do not know what examples the hon. Gentleman has in mind, I am sure that he is aware that that is, in many instances, very real consultation and has often led to different results, changes and a reconfiguration of proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of one or two examples where what came out after consultation, in which CHC	<div class='sub'>s</div> <!-- sub --> took part, was very different from the original proposals. That consultation is not meaningless or something that has no value for local people. It may not be perfect, or, from the hon. Gentleman's point of view, adequate, but it is a meaningful piece of consultation and we should not underplay it. Certainly, neither the hon. Member for Dudley, West or my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge underplayed it in their speeches, and I am sure that there will be full consultation in their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept basically what the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey is saying. I agree that there should be some discretion about those whom the Secretary of State thinks fit. I am not sure whether Members of Parliament should be formally involved in consultation, although most of us as constituency Members would, via one mechanism or another, be involved anyway. I am not sure whether local authorities should be involved. The hon. Gentleman mentioned councillors. That could be productive although much depends on which councillor it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that there is a statutory obligation for community health councils to be consulted now. That has been happening many years. Normally, the local trust takes a decision and tells them what it has done. It is a bit like the old consultation meetings I used to attend in industry. We went to a meeting once a month and the manager of the coal mine would tell us what we would do for the next month. It was not consultation—we were simply told what would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our first sitting, I brought to the Committee's attention a statutory instrument signed by the Minister on 7 March called the National Health Service Trusts (Consultation on Establishment and Dissolution) Regulations 1996. Although the Minister had signed it, I was not too sure whether he had read it. Presumably he has now had the opportunity to do so. Once that statutory instrument has gone through the House and been agreed will it enhance the current consultation? Will it achieve what the new clause seeks to do? If so,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V003P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
it would be pointless to accept it. Will there be proper consultation, or better consultation than there is at present through the introduction of that statutory instrument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation will not change. The statutory instrument replaces an existing one. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but it does not change our existing consultation procedures. They will continue unchanged under the new regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be quite happy with that. The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey must decide whether what he seeks is in situ at the moment. It certainly is not as regards Members of Parliament and councillors, but it is in terms of the organisations that should be the real guardians of how patients are treated by the NHS, namely the community health councils. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman wants to press the matter to a vote. If he is not prepared to do that, perhaps we could look at it at a later stage. Full consultation will be increasingly important in view of the cultural and other changes in the NHS under the 1990 Act. There has been a change in the interface between the health service at a local level and us as consumers. It is important to get consultation right in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be much more minded to withdraw the new clause if I had had any indication that the Minister was willing to widen the consultation basis. I will be grateful if he could tell us why, if the NHS is accountable through the Secretary of State's Department, there cannot be formal consultation with Members of Parliament—at least as part of the consultation on the dissolution of trusts and the removal of liabilities elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my experience there is full consultation with Members of Parliament about most major changes proposed to any trust or health authority. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's experience cannot be that different. Members of Parliament are usually fully consulted and their views sought about service changes of any kind. I find it strange that the hon. Gentleman should think that there is any inadequacy in that respect. Putting matters on a statutory basis might be different. On the present,
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
voluntary, basis Members of Parliament are fully involved in the changes. They may even play a leading role in consultation exercises—as we heard today about the right hon. Member for Dudley, East and my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge. I find it hard to agree with the hon. Gentleman that Members of Parliament are disadvantaged by the lack of a statutory role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the community health councils, I am, as it happens, talking to the central council of community health councils in about one hour. I undertake to raise there the matter of transfers of assets by trusts and the merging of trusts, along with issues about the general role of community health councils and consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detected a scintilla of movement in the Minister's stance at the end of his remarks, which might just rescue him from a vote. There has not yet been a vote in this Committee. We are in danger of getting out of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider another aspect. I accept that current practice is that a document is sent to Members of Parliament on the mailing list. Certainly, some MPs have found that, on various occasions on which our trusts changed, disappeared and re-merged in south-east London, all that happened—unless more was asked for, as it frequently was—was that a document was sent on which we were asked to comment. There was no requirement for that document to be sent. We need to ensure that plenty of watchdogs exist. We must ensure that the bodies that meet in secret to make the relevant decisions know that people are watching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister not just to speak to the community health councils, although I am grateful that he is willing to do that. I should also like him—and this request follows on from the point from the hon. Member for Rother Valley—to speak to his colleagues and find out whether before Report a clear agreement can be reached as to the best processes for consultation and whether those will at least be adopted as normal practice, if they are not written into the legislation. On that basis, and in accordance with the Committee's practice today, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
