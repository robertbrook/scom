CHARGE AND RATE OF CORPORATION TAX FOR 1996</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates to corporation tax, and it would be appropriate to mention the undershooting of the tax, which the Treasury Select Committee report addresses. The Red Book gives the most recent Budget forecast for this year's corporation tax receipts as £26.4 billion, but the latest forecast is £2 billion lower. The projections for next year are also down on the original forecasts. Some changes in corporation tax rates obviously result from changing profit rates—because profits slow down this year, corporation tax will be a little lower next year.<br><br>
The Select Committee dealt, however, with a second problem: corporation tax is declining as a percentage of profits. The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently noted that corporation tax was 50 per cent. of profits in 1990–91, but 47 per cent. two years later. I do not have more recent figures, but those that I have given encapsulate the problem.<br><br>
The former Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont), also alluded to the problem. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"One of the questions I am interested in is to what extent our Corporation Tax reforms have actually lessened the yield from companies below what we might have expected".</p></blockquote>
The Treasury Select Committee raised the issue with Treasury officials before Christmas, when it studied the Budget. In response to question 178 on page 33 of the minute, an official said of the undershoot:
<br><blockquote><p>"As regards corporation tax, this is the most difficult to explain. As you probably know, main-stream corporation tax is paid with more or less a year's delay, so that the tax we are collecting this year derives from last year's profits."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), who is not yet in his seat, added:
<br><blockquote><p>"Which must make it in principle, one would think, to a simpleminded person like myself, rather easier to predict?"</p></blockquote>
The Treasury official replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"Yes, one might think that".</p></blockquote>
He then gave one explanation of why corporation tax is less than we might expect. He said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Unfortunately, corporation tax is paid by 10,000-plus companies, all of whose tax position differs; they all have losses which they made previously and which they can set against corporation tax. They may have made losses earlier and they can set those against profits which they earn now. So the precise distribution of the aggregate profit figure across those 10,000-plus companies is absolutely vital to the corporation tax take."</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee was not impressed by that explanation, and page xxiv of its report noted:
<br><blockquote><p>"This does not adequately explain why corporation tax is lower than expected unless those companies with the majority of losses to relieve made the bulk of profits, and there is no reason why this should have occurred."</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee then considered other explanations, and asked the Government to tackle the problem seriously. It concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clearly, on the basis of one year's figures it would be rash to suggest a fundamental change between company profit and tax yield, but the Treasury will no doubt want to consider whether companies are becoming increasingly aware of the tax implications of their operations, are managing to become more adept at employing tax avoidance mechanisms and whether measures introduced in recent Budgets to reduce corporate tax avoidance are generating the additional revenues forecast at the time of their introduction. The Committee recommends that, in its response, the Government clarifies the reasons for the lower yield of corporation tax and explains whether this yield is likely to remain below previous expectations in the longer run."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will be able to say something about that when he replies. No doubt he will say that the matter is being considered and that we shall find out what the Government think in due course.<br><br>
The Select Committee suggests that tax avoidance goes on. Two other possibilities arise that should be considered. First, the period for trading losses set against corporation tax liabilities was extended in 1991 from one year to three years. That was thought to have led to a one-off decrease in payments of about £1 billion. Will the Minister say whether that was a one-off feature, or is it still having an effect?<br><br>
The second matter relevant to the reform of corporation tax concerns the treatment of dividends. If dividends rise at a rate different from that of profits—or if dividends rise as profits fall, as has happened recently—the higher proportion of profits going in dividends means that less tax is paid, because dividends affect the tax credit for almost half of those who receive it. So the increase in dividends as a share of profits must have an effect on the revenue collected in corporation tax.<br><br>
Some time ago the Government began dealing with a problem that is relevant to the way in which the tax system can be used more effectively to encourage investment. The previous Chancellor acted in a small way to deal with the problem when he reduced to 20 per cent. both the rate of advanced corporation tax and the tax credit. More radical measures may be required.<br><br>
I wanted to flag up the problem that I have described, and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) read out the excellent analysis
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
given by Treasury officials to the Select Committee, and in so doing partly answered his own question. Sometimes Opposition Members avoid acknowledging that a forecast is a forecast. Inevitably, as the Red Book shows, there are forecasting margins. All forecasters do their best to be as accurate as possible, but sometimes forecasts are not precise.<br><br>
In his Budget speech, my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor said, in reference to the missing tax:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, tax receipts have come in lower than expected this year. This is partly due to lower inflation and to lower growth."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 November 1995; Vol. 267, c.1057.]</p></blockquote>
The Chancellor pointed out that the consequence of that in terms of the public sector borrowing requirement was the difference between "two enormous numbers", so that forecasts of public borrowing have always been notoriously difficult to make. My right hon. and learned Friend also noted the more general reasons behind some of the questions raised by the hon. Member for Leith.<br><br>
I do not criticise the hon. Member for Leith for mentioning only en passant the difficult question of avoidance. I assure him that the Revenue is ever watchful for any schemes that might undermine sources of revenue, especially in the corporate sector. The hon. Gentleman will know that the Budget and this Bill contain measures to deal with such matters. Clever people will always thin up clever schemes, but the Revenue knows that and where necessary the Government amend the taxation law to take that into account.<br><br>
It was disappointing that the hon. Member for Leith referred to the missing amounts of money but not mention that the United Kingdom has one of the lowest corporation tax rates of any industrial country. That is to be applauded and I am delighted that clause 69 confirms that important factor in maintaining the competitiveness of British industry. I would also point out to the hon. Member for Leith that the profits of industrial, commercial and financial companies that are chargeable to corporation tax rose by more than 20 per cent. in 1993 and 1994.<br><br>
We should focus on the overall competitiveness of British industry. It is bringing in profits and increasing its investment, but we are ever watchful for leakages from the system. I hope that members of the Committee will confirm that our main rate of corporation tax should remain at 33 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just to avoid any doubt that the Minister might have sought to sow, Opposition Members, too, are most concerned for the international competitiveness of our tax system and for the ability of our companies to generate profit and to invest it for our long-term prosperity. That is why we will not oppose the clause.</span></p>

SMALL COMPANIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause proposes to reduce the small companies' rate of tax to 24 per cent. I shall resist the temptation to go through the 22 tax increases again—[HON. MEMBERS: "Go on."]—despite the entreaties of my hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we should now talk about the 23 tax increases of the Government? It has been announced today that because of the Government's settlement, the average council tax increase in Scotland will be 16 per cent. Surely that is the 23rd Tory tax increase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The only 23rd that I am interested in is the 23rd psalm. The hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) should not deal with any tax increases unless they fall within the scope of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall look though the 23rd psalm to see what it has to say about the council tax in Scotland; my hon. Friend is quite right.<br><br>
As we have already made clear, the Opposition's view is that Britain's taxpayers have suffered enough and we therefore support the proposal to reduce the small companies' rate. I should like to take the opportunity to make a few observations about the application of taxation to small companies and the impact of the change.<br><br>
The Inland Revenue press release, which was issued at the time of the Budget, asserted that about 350,000 companies, representing 85 per cent. of the total that pay tax, would benefit from the reduction. The same press release said that the costs of the reduction would be negligible for 1996–97, £95 million for 1997–98 and £130 million for 1998–99. The Chancellor made a great deal of the 1p reduction. It is therefore worth considering, on the basis of those figures, what it is worth to the average company.<br><br>
The effect of the 1p fall in the small companies' rate is that on average, according to the Government's figures, companies will enjoy next to no benefit in 1996–97, a fall of £271.43 in 1997–98 and a fall of £371.43 in 1998–99. I do not say that that is of no value, but I am sure that members of the Committee would agree that it is of modest value. One might argue that they are average figures; how do they look in an actual example? It is helpful to consider the position of a company making profits of, say, £1 million in a year. What does the company have to do to evaluate what that reduction is worth to it?<br><br>
The formula is set out in section 13 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. First, the company must decide whether its profits are below the lower relevant maximum amount, which is £300,000. If so,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
the 24 per cent. rate applies. Since the profits are clearly above that lower limit, the company must apply to its basic profits the full corporation tax rate and then reduce that amount by by another sum determined by the formula M-P x I/P where M is the upper relevant maximum amount, P is the amount of profits, and I is the amount of basic profits.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The formula takes the difference between the upper relevant maximum amount—£1.5 million, which has remained unchanged since 1994, as has the £300,000 lower limit—and the profits and multiplies the difference by the basic profits divided by the profits and a fraction which Parliament decides from time to time. In the Bill, the fraction is 9/400th. Last year, it was one fiftieth. Although basic profits and profits are often the same, they need not be. Other complexities arise for grouped companies. When the £1 million profit company has worked through all that, it will find that it has saved the princely sum of £1,250 for next year. I am not saying that that is of no value, but it is of modest value.<br><br>
Because the formula is essentially a smoothing mechanism between the lower rate of 24 per cent. and the full 33 per cent. rate, it is inevitable that, in the intermediate range, the marginal rate of taxation is higher-35 per cent. last year and, I think, 35 ¼ per cent. this year. Of course, as the gap between the lower and higher rate widens, one would expect the marginal rate in the intervening range to widen. It is interesting to note that the marginal rate on extra profit in that range will be 35 ¼ per cent.<br><br>
I quoted those figures by way of example to illustrate the modesty of the benefit and the complexity of some of the considerations involved. When the Minister replies to the debate, will he tell us why the Government have chosen the headline rate reduction instead of taking action on thresholds and why he thinks it a good idea that thresholds have been left unchanged since 1994? The Government must have a policy or philosophy underlying their approach to the threshold, and it would be useful if the Minister could tell the Committee what that is.<br><br>
I want to probe the Government's thinking on the definition of what is known as the small companies' rate. Literally, it is not so much a small companies' rate as a small profits rate. It means that large companies making small profits will benefit although small companies making large profits might not. It has been argued that trying the rate to the profit level rather than to another measure such as turnover is not the best way to apply relief. I should be grateful if the Minister could say more about the Government's thinking on that. Do they contemplate revising the definition so that relief would be more targeted at small companies rather than at small profits? What is their thinking?<br><br>
The Federation of Small Businesses put a question to all members of the Committee about the distortions caused as a result of incorporation or non-incorporation by the tax system. The Federation of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
Small Businesses points out that companies pay tax at 24 per cent. on profits up to £300,000 although individuals who trade as unincorporated sole traders will pay tax at 40 per cent. on profits of £31,265 or more. The top tax rate for companies is 33 per cent. whereas the top rate for individuals is 40 per cent. Although incorporation raises other issues too—not least the question of the extraction of wealth or income—the point remains that, at the margin the decisions and economics of small businesses may be distorted by tax. I should be grateful if the minister would enlighten the Committee as to how thoroughly the Government review and compare taxation under incorporation and taxation of a sole trader.<br><br>
Some would argue that other fiscal changes that could have been made in the Budget would have been of more benefit to small businesses than the cut in the headline rate. For example, the Chancellor did not reduce business rates from 7 ½ per cent. to 5 per cent., which is nearly double the rate of inflation if the Government are on course to meet their targets. The business rate is a fixed cost that all companies have to bear, irrespective of their ability to pay.<br><br>
Another possibility that the Chancellor considered as well as the reduction in the headline rate was the increase in the VAT threshold, which went up by £1,000 to £47,000. To have kept pace with inflation, it should have gone up to £48,000. That will inevitably increase the number of businesses that have to register for VAT. For many small companies, the cost of that will exceed the benefit of the lower rate of tax. After all, some of the highest compliance costs arise from VAT paid by small businesses as measured by turnover.<br><br>
The Labour party welcomed the Chancellor's decision to accept the recommendations of the tax law review committee and to rewrite tax legislation to simplify the language. I hope that the Committee will bear that closely in mind when we discuss new clause 2. We will argue strongly that small businesses would benefit from the use of a simpler language in Customs and Excise and VAT legislation.<br><br>
Although I welcome this reduction, I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with the points that I have raised, particularly on thresholds and incorporation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the reduction in the rate of corporation tax on small profits to 24 per cent., which must be a record low. although the hon. Member for Oxford, East was inclined to belittle the reduction, it will cost £130 million when it is fully instated in 1998–99. Together with the other reductions in business taxation set out in the Red Book—such as the amendments to the business rates transitional scheme and the reduction in employers' national insurance contribution—this is a substantial addition to the reductions in business taxation in the past 17 years.<br><br>
In 1979, the standard rate of corporation tax was 52 per cent. It is now 33 per cent., which is, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said, one of the lowest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
rates among major western industrialised countries. It is one of the many reasons why people invest in the United Kingdom. Although the yield is down a little compared with what was forecast, I am sure that the upward trend will continue. The present yield is between £25 billion and £26 billion. I remember a time when the yield from corporation tax was so low, because of the lack of profitability of British industry, that some people suggested that it should be abolished altogether because it was not worth collecting.<br><br>
In those days, inflation was so high that we had 100 per cent. capital allowances and stock relief, otherwise many companies would have gone to the wall. Those huge losses were carried forward into the early 1980s and the yield continued at a low level. The 1990s saw a big pick up in the yield from corporation tax, which will continue.<br><br>
Provisions for dealing with the profits of small companies are extremely welcome. The marginal rate on profits between £300,000 and £1.5 million at 35 per cent. is only 2 per cent. above the actual rate. That is good. It has to be above that rate because there is a clawback. It has the same effect as age allowance for retired people and it is spread over a broad band. The clause is extremely welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome the reduction in the rate of taxation on small companies from 25 per cent. to 24 per cent. I must emphasis, however, that that is no big deal—small business also think that. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East has already demonstrated his detailed technical grasp of how the small business tax rate operates, so my comments can be brief. He showed that the effect on individual businesses is very small indeed and it is not in keeping with the difficult problems that many businesses face. That is why small companies' reaction to the Budget reductions in corporation tax were so muted.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-West Surrey (Sir M. Grylls) is unfortunately not a member of this Committee. He has a great deal of experience in small businesses. When he said, in welcoming the Budget decrease, that he was
<br><blockquote><p>"disappointed at the absence of measures to encourage investment, particularly among businesses in the £3m to £50m a year turnover bracket".</p></blockquote>
he made a valid point. When the Government were considering policy options and decided on a reduction in the headline rate, they would have been better advised to consider other measures to tackle the real problems that businesses face.<br><br>
A recent survey by NatWest and the Small Businesses Research Trust outlines the main problems that are faced by businesses. Overwhelmingly, 36.4 per cent. of businesses said that low turnover and lack of business were the major problems. That says a great deal about the Government's macro-economic management, but it would not be prudent for me to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
pursue that point now. Cash flow and late payment were the next major problems that they identified. I know that the House will be considering a private Member's Bill on late payment shortly. Government regulations and paper work were specified as a problem by 9.9 per cent. of respondents.<br><br>
Nowhere in that survey was the rate of corporation tax mentioned as a significant problem. I recognise that we in the United Kingdom have one of the lowest overall rates of corporation tax within Europe. That is changing as other European countries seek to compete with our rates. It is important that Governments ensure that our rates of corporation tax are competitive with those of our fellow nations in the European Union. A principled target would be to set rates of corporation tax within the lower quartile of European Union nations. That would ensure that our businesses remain competitive in their chosen marketplaces.<br><br>
In addition to the reduction of the headline rate, which we have argued will be of limited benefit to small businesses, the Government make great play of other measures in the Budget to help them which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) mentioned earlier. While I welcome the increase in the VAT threshold, it is only 2.1 per cent. That is less than the rate of inflation in September 1995, which was 3.9 per cent.<br><br>
11.00 am<br><br>
We discussed the 0.2 per cent. reduction in employers' national income contributions in our debate on the landfill tax. It represents an annual saving of just £41.42 for each average male employee, who is, according to the statistics, on an income of £20,710 a year—many small businesses will not pay their average male workers anything like that. To make sufficient savings from the reduction in national income contributions to employ just one more worker, a company would already have to employ 500 people. That does not amount to a hill of beans or tackle the major problems that many small businesses face. That is why the Confederation of British Industry said in its response to the Budget that it would have preferred more measures to encourage investment. That is also why the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My organisation has been very disappointed by the speech. There has been absolutely no encouragement for growth and a lot of tinkering around the edges."</p></blockquote>
The Government could have done much more for small businesses. I welcome the reduction in the small companies' rate and do not object to that rate being specified in terms of profit, rather than of small companies' turnover. Intellectual consistency tells us that if we tax profits—as corporation tax does—a concessionary rate for small businesses should be based on the level of profits.<br><br>
The measure will not, however, greatly benefit businesses. As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East said, a business that makes a £1 million profit will benefit to the tune of only £1,200. That is nothing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
when we consider the ability of such companies to employ tax accountants to massage their profit levels. Although I welcome the proposals, therefore, the Government can and must do more to support small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a joy to hear such a unanimous welcome for the clause and I take comfort from that. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) has toured the country and talked to small businesses. From my conversations with her, I gather that they universally welcome the measure. That is true not only of the incorporated, but of the unincorporated sector, which benefits from taxation reductions in other ways. There has, therefore, been a real world welcome for the measure.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the comments of the hon. Member for Oxford, East. As usual, he gave us a slightly selective view of history. For accuracy and the record, I shall, therefore—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister will select his own facts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall select my facts as carefully as the hon. Member for Oxford, East did. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield reminded us what the main company rate of corporation tax was under the most recent Labour Government. I want to go a stage further and remind the Committee that the small companies rate of corporation tax between 1974 and 1978 was 42 per cent. During that period, the lower profit limit rose from only £25,000 to £60,000. We all remember what happened to inflation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield reminded us. So there was a lack of generosity from Labour Members when they had an opportunity to do something about it. In the period from 1979 to the present, the small companies rate had fallen from that level to the level proposed in the clause. That shows that the Government take seriously our responsibilities for the so-called small businesses.<br><br>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Oxford, East on his mathematical tour de force. If he had asked for our advice we might have been able to simplify the job for him. We acknowledge that there is a marginal rate of 35.25 per cent. between £300,000 and £1.5 million, but what matters to a business is the average rate of tax. The impression could be gained that a small business tax rate exists that is higher than 24 per cent. I hope that what I have said makes it clear that it is the average rate that counts.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) and for Oxford, East spoke about the competitiveness of small company taxation in this country. It is important to note that the Bill will ensure that the United Kingdom has the lowest tax burden of any major European economy, and the lowest rate of corporation tax of any major industrialised country. A comparison of the small companies' rate internationally is interesting and shows that we perform extremely well—for example, Belgium's rate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
is 28.84 per cent., the Netherlands' is 40 per cent., and Japan's is 28 per cent. The Bill means that the rate in the United Kingdom will be 24 per cent. on a profit limit up to £300,000. The Japanese rate of 28 per cent. applies to only £28,199.<br><br>
I could go on, but shall say only that our small companies' corporation tax regime is very competitive. The hon. Member for Oxford, East should beware chastising the Government over that regime. An examination of another aspect of small companies' competitiveness shows that, in Britain, an employer has to add £18 for non-wage costs for every £100 spent on wages. The same employer in Germany would have to add £32, in Spain £34, in France £41 and in Italy £44. That may have something to do with the espousal of policies such as the social chapter, which add costs to industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be other factors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) says that there may be other factors. However, the proposed small company rates of corporation tax will add further to the competitiveness of our country's small companies.<br><br>
The hon. member for Oxford, East asked a number of specific questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of clarity, my point was that the difficulties faced by countries in different parts of Europe are entirely home grown. They have nothing whatsoever to do with the social chapter. Many reforms might usefully be made in Spain or Germany, but those countries' difficulties have nothing to do with the social chapter. The Government blame the social chapter for all sorts of things on which it has no effect at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that mentioning the social chapter touches a nerve with the hon. Gentleman, causing him to rise and offer a contribution. However, this Committee is not an appropriate place for a debate on the social chapter, although I should be delighted if another opportunity arose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What did touch a raw nerve was the Minister's repeated assertions of things that are not true. It is interesting to note that he does not disagree with what I said. He accepts that what he said was absolute nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not deal in absolute nonsense. I merely repeat the facts and figures recently published in a pamphlet from the Department for Education and Employment. If the hon. Gentlemen disputes those figures he should produce his own. The social chapter implies high social costs, and the Labour party has sought to underline its support for that type of approach. What I said was not rubbish; the facts are there for all to see.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The social chapter is particularly pertinent to a debate on small businesses and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 305</span>
corporation tax rate. It is clear from reading the social policy agreement that the social chapter does not apply to small businesses. Perhaps I may quote briefly from article 22—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is making an intervention, is he not? Without making any rulings on the matter, interventions should not include quotes. They should make only a brief point. The hon. Gentleman has made his point without the benefit of the quote, so perhaps the Minister could reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to trespass too far from the subject; I am sure that there will be many occasions in the House when we can debate those matters and explore the Opposition's position on them. Many would like to expose Opposition Members' thinking in public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I can pull the Minister back from his wilder fantasies about the social chapter to the questions that I asked him, why have the thresholds not been increased? What does he have to say to the Federation of Small Businesses when it argues that there should be a narrowing of the difference in rates between corporation tax and schedule D because of the incorporation issues that I raised earlier?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My reckless generosity in giving way so many times to Opposition Members prevented me from answering those very questions but I shall do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hunt <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wirral, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just point out to those who have intervened on my hon. Friend that there is nothing in the social protocol that limits its application only to medium to larger firms; it applies to all firms and to all matters in the social area. That is an extremely extensive remit and causes great concern to many of the small and medium-sized businesses in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes a powerful point in a way that I could not improve on.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked about the concerns of the Federation of Small Businesses. I would answer his query by saying that the adjustment to the small companies' rate is recognition of the fact that since 1983 there has effectively been a link between the basic rate of tax and the small companies' rate.<br><br>
We are talking about measures for dealing with incorporated rather than unincorporated companies. Many factors have to be taken into account when deciding whether a company becomes incorporated or unincorporated. There are differences in the allowances that an unincorporated individual receives but which companies do not in respect of their corporation tax.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
Effectively, we have kept the rates in line but there are differences that are for the company to decide when determining whether to enjoy a tax regime for unincorporated or incorporated companies. The Budget contains changes that would give added benefit to those who choose to go down the unincorporated route because of changes in allowances in the Bill to which we have already agreed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East also asked why the profit limits had not been increased as well. In fact, as he knows, they were increased in 1994 and have trebled under the Government since 1988. Indeed, they continue to be high in international terms when compared with those of other OECD countries which also have special rates for small companies. Given that more than 80 per cent. of incorporated companies pay at the small companies' rate, it seemed that our available resource was better spent on reducing the small companies' rate of corporation tax than on changing those margins. I hope that that assists the hon. Member for Oxford, East.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we had done any further thinking on the nature and structure of the taxation of small companies. I shall make the following observations, but I hope that he will not immediately rush into public print because I have had the courtesy to answer his question. Immediately, the hon. Gentleman wants to say that there is a new Government policy. Let me answer his question in any case. If the small companies rate were linked to turnover, there would be a benefit under such a regime to companies with low overheads and high margins—namely, service industries. Companies with high overheads and low margins—for example, in retailing—would be penalised.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The present regime serves the small business sector well in terms of equity. The Government did not restrict themselves in the Budget to helping small businesses through the reduction in small companies corporation tax. We have been criticised for the limited amount of spending in the provisions. However, our thinking was influenced by the fact that the qualifying age for capital gains tax retirement relief is being cut from 55 to 50 and national insurance charges are being reduced.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Dudley, West mentioned, there is also a deregulation package. We have also taken steps to ensure closer working between Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Contributions Agency. We have acknowledged that that is an important issue and we have addressed the problem. The business rates transitional scheme has also been of assistance to small companies, so we have offered a comprehensive package for small companies. We take their problems very seriously and we have responded to them.<br><br>
I shall conclude as I started. The Economic Secretary has held many discussions with small businesses around the country. She has brought the

news that small businesses welcome our package of measures, especially the reduction in the small companies corporation tax rate.</span></p>

LIVING ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED FOR EMPLOYEES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a few points to put to the Minister. We broadly support the clause, which is designed to close a loophole in provisions relating to the taxation of employer-provided accommodation in sections 145 and 146 of the Income Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Under section 145, an employee for whom accommodation is provided is taxed on the value of accommodation—the higher of the gross annual value determined under section 837 of the Act as the rent that might be obtained on a letting from year to year on a landlord-repairing basis, or the rent paid by the employer less any contribution made by him. Representative accommodation is excluded where it is necessary for the proper performance of the employee's duties—a point to which I shall return later.<br><br>
Section 146 imposes an additional charge on employees living in accommodation provided by an employer at a cost in excess of £75,000. The additional value is the excess of the cost of each property over £75,000 times the rate applicable at the beginning of the tax year used in determining the benefit from cheap or interest-free loans—about 7.2 per cent. from 6 February. Section 145 is applicable only if the accommodation
<br><blockquote><p>"is not otherwise made the subject of any charge to him by way of income tax".</p></blockquote>
Since section 146 bites only if a charge under section 145 is made, the restriction also applies to section 146. The exclusion of accommodation
<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise made the subject of any charge by him by way of income tax".</p></blockquote>
has encouraged schemes under which employees forgo a certain amount of salary in return for the accommodation. In those circumstances, case law provides that the employee is taxable under the basic schedule E charge in section 19 of the 1988 Act on a benefit equal to the amount of salary forgone. That is the Heaton v. Bell case of 1969 which established, in favour of the Revenue, that an employee was taxable on the benefit of a company car, where the provision was matched by deduction from gross pay. The decision was not affected by the introduction of a statutory basis of taxing company cars in the Finance Act 1976.<br><br>
To apply the Heaton <i>v.</i> Bell case, an employee would agree to take a deduction from salary that would be less than the amount taxable under sections 145 and 146 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
Those sections could not, however, apply because the benefit was "otherwise chargeable" under the basic schedule E charge under section 19 of the 1988 Act. Such arrangements are known as reverse Heaton <i>v.</i> Bell schemes. As I understand it, the primary objective of the clause is to deal with such schemes.<br><br>
A question arises from an earlier comment by the Minister, who suggested that the Revenue keeps a close eye on loopholes. The Treasury has known about reverse Heaton <i>v.</i> Bell schemes dealing with accommodation for a long time and it has already dealt with the issue in relation to cars, so the real question is why it has taken the Treasury so long to close the loophole. We need an answer to that. The loophole is neither bizarre nor rare; it is quite well known, but the Treasury seems to have taken an awfully long time to deal with it.<br><br>
Line 24 of table 5.1 of the Red Book and the Inland Revenue press release No. 35 establish that the measure will save £10 million a year during 1996–97 and 1998–99. Therefore, how much have the Government lost by not dealing with the issue earlier? Those are my main questions<br><br>
Can the Minister give me clarification on a couple of other points? I have already said that people who are obliged to live in certain accommodation will not be covered by the provisions. Can the Minister reassure us about what would happen in the case of pub landlords, for example, who are obliged, by reason of their employment, to live in accommodation exclusive to them? Another example are dons at Oxford, who are obliged, on occasion, to live in certain accommodation at the university. Even doctors in hospitals are obliged, because they are on duty for prolonged periods, to use specific accommodation and to be easily available. Such accommodation is available exclusively to them. How would the provision affect people in such circumstances? Am I right to understand that such circumstances would not be covered by the provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr O'Brien) on his assiduous reading of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The measure is tight and narrowly focused and the hon. Gentleman described it accurately, especially with reference to the reverse Heaton v. Bell cases. The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about why the measure had taken so long. In any Finance Bill there are limitations on the number of issues that can be dealt with. Last year, the judgment was made that the risk of large-scale avoidance and the need for early action—to which, in fairness, the hon. Gentleman attested—was the greatest for company cars. Therefore, the matter was dealt with in last year's finance legislation.<br><br>
The Revenue should keep an eye on trends: it is not possible always to act on one event, but if there is a growing trend, as appears to be the case here, the Revenue will ask that the matter be examined. We therefore examined it and agreed that the action set out in the clause was necessary.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 309</span>
The hon. Gentleman cited pub landlords and asked whether they would be affected by the measure. About 170,000 employees fall within statutory exemptions where accommodation is necessary for the performance of their duties. Certain farm workers and publicans would fall into that category. It is important not to give specific rulings or judgments at this stage. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned dons: I am not familiar with their circumstances. He may have gone to a university where there were dons, but I did not, so I am unable to comment on that. We should examine individual circumstances.<br><br>
People who are provided with accommodation because it is necessary for the performance of their duties will not be touched by this provision. The clause targets this particular tax avoidance scheme, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Inland Revenue press release suggests that this is a simplifying measure. It is arguable that the abolition of aggregation—it is not entirely abolished, but it is no longer obligatory—is a simplifying measure of the employer, but certainly it is not always a simplifying measure for the employee.<br><br>
I spent some time going through the wording of the clause. It is contrary to the notion of simplicity in legislation, which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) so eloquently argued for last year, and was supported by Opposition Members. Both sides of the House support the principle of self assessment, although we have differences on the way in which it should be implemented. As we move towards self assessment, it is increasingly important to have simplicity and clarity in legislation. The wording of the clause is complex. Will the Minister agree to reconsider the wording of the clause to see whether it can be made clearer? If that is appropriate, will he return on Report with a clearer wording that we can consider again?<br><br>
The Law Society, in its submission to us, raised a further point. Disaggregation may be beneficial to employers, because in certain circumstances they can elect to aggregate: that election is at the behest of the employer. However, because of the intricacies of the tax system, disaggregation may not be in the interest of the employee. There is good argument for enabling employees to have a consultative input into the decision on whether to aggregate. The Law Society suggests that employees should have the right to give their consent to it. Will the Minister respond to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
legitimate points raised by the Law Society? I declare an interest as a solicitor and a member of the Law Society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an important point on complexity. If I may, I shall dwell for a few moments on how we should deal with that problem. As a layman and not a lawyer, I welcome the thrust of section 160 of the Finance Act 1995. It pointed the way towards the creation of the new English bible version of tax law: one which we could pick up, read and understand. The difficulty is that we would have to revise large chunks of tax law to create that new version. We cannot amend in newspeak tax legislation that is in oldspeak. If the seamless web of continuity is to survive, the House will have to decide how best to make progress once the five-year programme is under way.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if, for the reasons that I gave, I cannot give him the comfort of an assurance that we shall redraft the clause to achieve the simplicity that he seeks. However, he makes an important point. I shall draw his observations to the attention of those in the Revenue who will be involved in the simplification exercise.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for North Warwickshire that the Bill was drafted after extensive consultation with interested parties, so it cannot be too incomprehensible. Those interested parties welcomed the terms of the proposals. They were interested in the proposals' effect and in whether what has to be done in the context of self-assessment where there are various loans could be understood. The disaggregation for the majority of taxpayers so affected was also welcomed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman realises that real people in the real word understand what is required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the phrase "majority of". I accept what he said, but did not the consultations cover the effects of the proposals on a minority of taxpayers? If so, does not what I said apply to that minority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a large number of people had disagreed with the proposals I am sure that there would have been many more representations. The hon. Gentleman mentioned only the representation from the Law Society, to which I now turn.<br><br>
There may be a slight misunderstanding on the question of elections. In the context of the Bill, elections apply only in respect of directors of closed companies. That does not affect the totality of people who could be affected by the measure. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Member for North Warwickshire. I shall be happy to write to him if he has any further questions.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>(4) Subsection (3) above shall apply for the year 1997–98 and subsequent years of assessment.'.</p></blockquote>
The impact of the tax changes on charities will be considerable. A number of charities are worried that the reduction in the base rate from 25p to 24p will disbenefit them in terms of the amount of money that they will receive from donors. Hon. Members should make it clear that we value the enormous good work that is done by the charitable organisations in Britain. We should acknowledge that some of the Bill's provisions that may benefit the general public may not benefit the charities or enhance their ability to carry out their important work.<br><br>
The amendment would index the annual uprating of the level at which benefits can go to the charities from payroll deduction schemes. There have been problems in the past with that annual uprating. I dealt with some of them on Tuesday, when the Committee considered the blind persons' allowance. Although the problems with payroll giving schemes have not been as bad, there have been gaps in the uprating of the level of benefit that is given to charities from those schemes. Perhaps I might explain to members of the Committee what has happened.<br><br>
In 1986–87 the level was set at £120. It was then increased progressively in 1987–88 by doubling it to £240. In 1989–90 it went up to £480 and then in 1990–91 it was increased to £600, which is where it stopped for two years. In 1992–93 it was again increased, substantially and proportionately—I do not in any way criticise the increase but I note the delay—to £600. On each occasion it is arguable that the level has caught up, so we have not had a progressive devaluing of the benefit to certain parties as happened with the blind persons' allowance. The progressive increase, by and large, dealt with increases in the retail prices index.<br><br>
The Government have shown a degree of commitment to the idea of payroll deduction schemes and payroll giving to charities, which I acknowledge. However, the non-uprating for the year 1991–92 was regrettable. It is to be regretted from our point of view as legislators that when something does not appear in a Bill, it is therefore not changed and persons therefore lose out. No doubt it will also be seen by the charities as a disbenefit that they would rather not have.<br><br>
There was again a two-year gap in increase between 1993–94 and 1995–96, when there was again an increase to £900. A considerable increase—to £1,200—is now proposed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
There is a problem with payroll giving, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge, and it is one that we regret. According to Inland Revenue press release no. 10, only 7,500 payroll giving schemes currently exist. In 1994–95, £16 million was donated on which tax relief of £4 million was given. The increased limit may encourage some existing donors—particularly the better-off—to give more to charity under the scheme but it is unlikely to attract new donors to it. Larger donors may well be more interested in setting up their own covenanting arrangement. The Charities Aid Foundation provides a simple chequebook method of charitable giving.<br><br>
On the basis that the change in the limit seems unlikely to increase the use of payroll giving schemes, it may be that the administrative effort required of employers is a disincentive. We need a review of the way in which the scheme operates. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what thought the Government have given to increasing the use of the scheme and whether there are ways, either through the tax system or by more advertising or other promotions to encourage more people to become involved.<br><br>
Because of the lack of take-up of the scheme, because the indexation has not always occurred each year with proper uprating and because charities will not benefit from this Finance Bill, it is legitimate and reasonable for us to agree this year properly to index the scheme. That would enable the indexation henceforth of the scheme year upon year. If the Government decided, next year or the year after, to give a substantial increase to the charities or even to remove the ceiling on such charitable deductions, their decision could be included in legislation and would be welcomed by charitable organisations. If they decided only to uprate the ceiling, that would not require measures in next year's Finance Bill. If the amendment is accepted, however, the Government could not—by default or by failing to include a measure in a Finance Bill—allow the ceiling to remain the same and fail to increase it at least in line with RPI.<br><br>
The amendment offers similar benefits to those of my amendment on the blind persons' allowance—both introduce a degree of candour into legislation. From a parliamentary, political and moral standpoint, failing to include measures in a Bill and, therefore, increasing the tax that people pay is not a good way to proceed. The House should not prevent charities from benefiting from indexation simply by failing to make provisions. That would lower the esteem of persons in the House even further that it is now.<br><br>
We should approach legislation openly so that the public and parliamentarians can see what we are doing. We should be able to raise issues at the right time, although I accept that it is open to Opposition parties to table new clauses at the end of our consideration of a Bill.<br><br>
The amendment gives charities a message of support and will ensure that they receive benefits and that no Government can sneak disbenefits through. It will also provide a necessary degree of candour in legislation.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is extraordinarily churlish. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire said that the Government are committed to an extent to payroll giving. He then said that the ceiling was £120 when the Government introduced it in 1987. It is now £1,200–10 times greater. Had it been indexed from £120, it might have reached £200 by now, whereas it has in fact increased 10 times since its introduction. There is no need for indexation. People who want to give more to charity can do so through the gift-aid scheme. There is no fiscal disincentive to giving money to charity.<br><br>
I welcome the increase in the clause, but we should concentrate on how to persuade more large employers to take up the scheme and on how large charities can persuade employees to participate. The hon. Gentleman's figures are disappointing because the scheme is attractive. It may involve more administration for employers, but that should not be a problem for large ones. It is, however, an efficient way of encouraging people to give to charity, and I am sorry that take-up has not been greater. We must ask how we can encourage that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that I am being churlish. I thought that I was quite generous during my contribution. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell the Committee how he justifies the failure to uprate in those two years. I accept that indexation would have had the effect that he described, but it would have meant that the disbenefit to charities that occurred during the two years in which the Government did not uprate would not have occurred. We are trying to deal with that problem.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was announced today that inflation has fallen to 2.9 per cent. That is extremely good news. The Bank of England inflation report published yesterday said that we have the lowest underlying rate of inflation over the longest sustained period for nearly 50 years. Indexation would apply 3 per cent. to £1,200, which would amount to £36. As it happens, that number is divisible by 12—an important factor, which helps employers with people who are paid monthly. At the moment, the amount is £75 a month, and it is to be increased to £100 a month. That is more sensible that having a 3 per cent. indexation.<br><br>
It is absurd for the hon. Member for North Warwickshire to criticise the Government for failing to index the amount, given that it has been increased by 10 times in less than 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to speak in support of this small but important amendment, which gives us the opportunity to return to the question of the way in which the Bill affects charities. Charities have been mentioned several times in our proceedings. I do not wish to appear churlish, as I have a number of close connections with charities and I know that every pound counts for them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
I also know that it is important for charities to have some control over the stability of their income. The Financial Secretary said earlier in our proceedings that the Bill works against charities in broad terms. The Bill mentions charities in a number of places. Last week, the Committee debated VAT on conversions for residential use as it affected charities. Our attempts to help charities were resisted by the Government.<br><br>
Earlier this week, we discussed how the reduction in income tax would affect covenant giving to charities. The charities have revised their forecast of how much they will lose. Their initial headline figure of £17 million has been replaced by an estimate that the provision will cause them to lose £10 million.<br><br>
When we discussed the matter earlier, the Minister said that the great saviour and great way forward would be payroll giving. That is what amendment no. 106 deals with. It is similar to an earlier amendment tabled on blind persons' allowances, and would mean that the top rate would be increased each year with inflation. That is transparent and would help employers. More especially, it would help charities. One of their main difficulties is knowing how much they will have coming in and how much expenditure they can set against that amount.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire said, there have been long periods in the history of charitable donations through payroll deductions when the sum has been frozen. That makes life difficult for charities.<br><br>
I want to ask the Financial Secretary about the cost of the clause, as there is nothing about that in the Red Book. I presume that that is because the cost is negligible. My hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire was right to describe the limited scope of the payroll deduction scheme. I want to ask the Financial Secretary again about the effect of the Bill on charities. What will charities gain from the measure? The hon. Gentleman should put a figure on it. In earlier exchanges he claimed that the Budget would be very good for charities. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Charities have the potential to gain substantially from the Budget, which aims at long-term prosperity and seeks to leave people with more of their money to do with as they want".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 13 February 1996; c. 223.]</p></blockquote>
His analysis may be right, but my analysis of economic circumstances is not so rosy. I do not recognise any feel-good factor.<br><br>
We have heard some figures today, but my impression is that the housing market is barely moving. Many families feel a real sense of insecurity. People are worried about their job and the prospect of finding another job if they lose it. People are also worried about part-time working. Given that perception of the state of the economy, the Financial Secretary's broad argument—that people will have more money in their pockets and will therefore give more money to charity—is not as strong as he believes. The Bill does little for charities at best, and I support the amendment mainly because it may reverse the trend. It would provide charities with greater clarity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
and give them some idea about how they can raise money in future. It would give them stability—a cornerstone for them to look forward to the future. I want to ensure that charities have a successful future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Committee's support for the scheme. It was first introduced in the Budget of 1987 and has proved popular; there are some 300,000 donors today. I hope that all members of the Committee will encourage firms in their constituencies to make use of the scheme and to provide a facility for their employees to give regularly to charities through deductions made in PAYE scheme. That is not, of course, the only way in which people can give to charity. Deeds of covenant and gift aid provide other tax-efficient mechanisms.<br><br>
We are pleased to recommend an increase in the upper limit in this Budget. I stress that it affects only the upper limit: the majority of employees who donate monthly provide a rather smaller amount. We are increasing the upper limit therefore for the minority of employees who wish to give more than £75 a month—the present limit.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire said that previous upratings had caught up with inflation. In fact, we went far beyond inflation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said. Had we uprated only in line with inflation, as invited by the amendment, the 1987 limit would only have reached £220. The figure is now £900 and we recommend a further, significant increase to £1,200 a year. To that extent, the amendment is unnecessary. Administrative convenience and the popularity of the scheme are further factors. It is important that, as far as possible, the scheme is made simple, easy to understand and attractive for employees.<br><br>
[MR. JAMES HILL <i>in the Chair</i>]<br><br>
The point was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield who said that the limit should be easily divisible by 12. The present proposed limit is easy because it increases the amount from £75 to £100 a month, but if we indexed it, we would almost certainly uprate to an arithmetically precise, but administratively inconvenient sum. As all the forms must be rewritten and the leaflets reprinted, it is wise to uprate only when we can have a sum which is easily understandable and divisible by 12.<br><br>
As to selling the scheme, I would welcome the Committee's assistance. We do what we can to promote it through Government Departments. All the major Departments have gift aid schemes and I believe that there is one in the House of Commons as well. The fact that we are discussing the issue today and are increasing the upper limit to £1,200 will help a little more to increase the number of schemes next year from 7,350. The issue does not require an amendment along the lines proposed so I will not recommend one. The amendment is unnecessary and, probably, administratively unwelcome.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General made one valid point, of which the amendment does not take full account. I accept that. That point is the need that the figure be divisible by 12. At the same time, the Paymaster General does not take account of the need for candour in our legislative process and the need to ensure that we suggest to the charities which will lose out this year that we are a little concerned.<br><br>
Therefore, let us take on board the Paymaster General's statement that the figure needs to be divisible by 12 and ask him whether he would be prepared to present an amendment on Report to ensure that it would be possible to raise the sum to the nearest appropriate figure divisible by 12—indexation could take place each year and the figure could be the nearest higher figure divisible by 12 above the retail prices index level. That would be an appropriate way for the Government to show their commitment to the policy.<br><br>
The Opposition would share such a commitment—indeed, we would seek to enhance it. It would be a means by which all Committee members could demonstrate the value attached to the work undertaken by people engaged in charitable tasks on behalf of the community. If we do not do something like that today, the right message will not, regrettably, be sent to those who spend their own time working for charities. I hope that the Paymaster General can be more positive than he has been about the amendment.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By introducing the scheme in the first place and then dramatically uprating the upper limit, the Government have done rather better than the hon. Gentleman suggested. I am content to recommend the present arrangements to the Committee.</span></p>

<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on the clause. We are broadly in support of some of the proposals. The annual voluntary settlement of taxation by the employer of tax liability that would otherwise be charged to employees for minor benefits is a valued and good way of administering the tax system. The detail of how that is to be achieved raises one or two issues—minor, we hope—that need clarification. The Institute of Taxation and other bodies have highlighted some potential complications.<br><br>
I shall briefly outline how the clause will operate. It deals, for instance, with cases in which an employer organises a party that falls outside the £75 concession for staff functions. All staff who attend should be charged tax on the apportioned cost of the party. In practice, that is undesirable and impractical. It is undesirable because the good will created by the staff party is likely to be undermined if employees receive a tax bill for it some months or a year later. It is impractical because the cost of the party has to be divided between only those who attended the party. Some people may be obliged to turn up, others may fail to turn up, some may bring a partner and others may not, and some may be unable to attend at the last moment. There are many complications.<br><br>
Annual voluntary settlements are ideal for that situation. The employer tells the local tax office the cost of the party and grosses it up by the average rate of tax roughly reflecting the attendees' marginal rate.<br><br>
I shall return to the question of how that will be done, but at present the calculation is performed on a common-sense basis, taking into account the salary and marginal tax position of the staff involved. The employee will know that information from the PAYE records. Tax is then paid to the Revenue by the employer on that grossed up amount.<br><br>
Despite the extra administrative costs to the employer, the AVS is a win, win, win situation, so to speak. The employee wins, because he pays no tax on the party; the Revenue wins because it receives more money and has lower administrative costs when it comes to collection; and the employer wins because the good will created by the party remains intact. The employer also saves himself the difficult task of correctly allocating the benefit to numerous returns in respect of his employees.<br><br>
AVS also works in respect of other matters that arise between employer and employee, such as relocation costs that exceed the £8,000 limit for an individual or the reimbursement of telephone expenses. Other examples for which AVS is desirable include disallowable relocation expenses, benefits to the cost of spouses accompanying employees on overseas business trips, Christmas gifts and prizes for excellent performance.<br><br>
The difficulty is that we are moving towards self-assessment. For many years, AVSs were negotiated informally between the board of the Inland Revenue and the local tax man on a general care and management basis. Now there is a demand for more certainty in the way in which the matter is orchestrated—hence the provisions in this clause.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
The Institute of Taxation is worried that the Revenue intends to apply what is known as the cap to the provisions. Up to now, tax has been charged in accordance with the average of the marginal rates of the individuals involved. The clause will deny people the use of a settlement agreement where the recurrent benefits are likely to exceed 5 per cent. of the cash earnings. As the level of benefits is likely to be fixed, the lowest-paid employee will be the one to trigger the cap. So if the lowest-paid employee earns £9,000, the cap will be £450. If his or her total benefits package exceeds that amount, the deregulatory benefits will disappear. So no AVS will be possible and a detailed settlement will then be necessary.<br><br>
The Institute of Taxation identifies the danger that the provisions mean that we will move away from a good system that worked well. The self-assessment system is more complex. It is supposed to make matters more simple, but the operation of the cap is likely to disbenefit all the parties involved. The ease with which the informal agreement could be negotiated will be lost, and a degree of complexity will be added to the process of self-assessment.<br><br>
The change of system and the introduction of the cap will be achieved largely by regulation, and there will be more detailed application of those regulations by the Inland Revenue in due course. However, there is a legitimate concern that the way in which it will operate will take away something that is quite good—it will not abolish it, but it will make it more complex and harder to achieve. The proper desire of the Government to seek to simplify matters for self-assessment and to put them into a proper statutory framework might not have that effect; it might actually undermine something that was worked well until now. Will the Minister address that?<br><br>
My only other point was again raised by the Institute of Taxation. Will all the informal and sometimes complex agreements with the Inland Revenue, which work well at the moment, now become subject to the unamended statutory provisions, or will it be possible for some of them, complex as they are, to be maintained, simply because they have worked quite well for so long? Will that situation be able to continue even after the Bill is enacted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the clause which is in the spirit of deregulation that I know my hon. Friends are trying to pursue.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister say when the regulations are likely to come into force? We should ensure that there is some flexibility in the future and I agree with the point that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire made about the cap. If the Revenue sought to apply a 5 per cent. cap when quite modest incomes are involved, it would cause more difficulties in the tax system. I am interested in what my hon. Friend has to say about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to answer the questions that were posed by the hon. Member for North
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0401">Image</span>

Warwickshire. It became apparent, as a result of legal advice that the Revenue had received, that the current informal arrangements no longer had the necessary vires to be continued. In seeking the powers to continue what the hon. Gentleman correctly identified as sensible, local and individually negotiated arrangements, we introduced the clause to give the necessary vires and precision to what we were doing.<br><br>
To reassure the hon. Gentleman it is not our aim to try to do away with the benefits of the discussions that currently take place between companies and the Revenue. The hon. Gentleman is right—the flexibility and the informality are of benefit to the 2,500 employers who have that type of agreement and we do not intend our proposals to remove that. That is why there will be full consultation with employers and employers' organisations on the draft regulations that will bring the measures into force. We plan to issue a consultative document to deal with that measure later this spring, hopefully in March.<br><br>
To answer my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg), it is not in any way our aim to put unnecessary additional bureaucracy on to companies. The essence of the arrangements will remain unchanged; it is the legal framework within which they will operate that will change. Existing agreements will normally be continued until the following year. Therefore, as we introduce the regulations that will bring in the measure, the current arrangements will remain as they are.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire commented on the cap. It is our assessment—which I hope he will accept as a piece of sensible analysis on our part—that it is unlikely to cause a problem. Based on current experience, companies can operate within the types of expense about which we are talking. They include late-night taxis, employer-provided buses to work, subscriptions to gyms and sports clubs, free chiropody and telephone bills. They can work within that cap, and we are not putting an unnecessary ceiling on them.<br><br>
It will still be possible to negotiate the arrangements with the Revenue. The benefits of the flexibility, informality and understanding that exist between individual inspectors and companies will not be lost under the arrangements. The clause will give vires to the current schemes. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's questions.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances on some points. I understand why the clause has been introduced—current arrangements are no longer appropriate in terms of the law. I welcome his assurances on proper consultation and the operation of current agreements.<br><br>
I am still somewhat concerned, however, about the operation of the cap. Individual agreements with employees are still a useful way to deal with several issues. I identified the example of someone who receives £9,000 and on whom a cap of £450 is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
imposed. What would happen if he faced relocation costs in excess of the £8,000 limit? Someone who earns £9,000 is unlikely to be able to claim such relocation costs from his employer. He may have to take his spouse on an overseas visit, which may cost more than the £450. Does an individual return then have to be made?<br><br>
What would happen in the case of an employee who was temporarily working abroad and is regularly visited by his or her spouse? The cost is likely to be in excess of £450, particularly if flights are involved. What if someone wanted to give Christmas gifts or a prize for excellent performance in excess of £450? What about the write-off of a staff loan when employees have been in financial difficulties? In each case, all the cap does is to impose an unnecessary complication.<br><br>
The Minister told us why he had imposed the cap, and a cap may have to apply in some cases. The level of the cap could, however, be reconsidered—it should perhaps be higher. The Inland Revenue could be given greater discretion when applying the cap in individual cases. Guidelines could be promoted to ensure that the Inland Revenue has some discretion in negotiations with employers. Those are potential ways of avoiding the complications that the cap imposes. Will the Financial Secretary take those concerns on board and write to me so that members of the Committee know how we might avoid such complexities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to save myself a letter and a stamp be responding to the hon. Gentleman's point now. The clause is not intended to be an onerous and complex measure that lacks flexibility. We shall take careful note of what the hon. Gentleman and others have said about regulations during the consultation process. That will enable us to deal with any areas of doubt, not merely by means of correspondence but by careful analysis.<br><br>
It may comfort the hon. Gentleman to know that it is our intention to operate the cap flexibly so that the points he made on relocation expenses can be taken into account. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West that we want flexibility to be retained in the current system. The present arrangements have particular benefits, which can be tailored to an individual company's needs. They are widely welcomed. There seems to be no serious disagreement about the right way forward, but we will have the benefit of the consultation period. There will be an opportunity to deal with his unanswered questions during the consultation process.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to chapter IV of the Bill on share options, profit sharing and employee share ownership. It contains clauses 102 to 111, four of which raise matters of principle: the other clauses are consequential on those four.<br><br>
The Committee will have noticed that we have not tabled any amendments to those clauses, mainly because the issues that I want to raise relate to the principle and can be dealt with on the clause stand part debate rather than by probing amendments that are then withdrawn. Last year I read an interesting article about the proceedings of the preceding year that had been written by an academic who had worked long and hard about why amendments had not been tabled and whether it was because people were not concerned about the provision or for some other reason. He got two or three articles out of it and, I dare say, a few conferences. I made those preliminary remarks to save another academic from wasting too much time pondering these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I read into that that the hon. Gentleman is already looking for a second form of employment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not write the articles. Happily, I have another form of employment should I wish to return to the Bar an spend much time litigating on the matters that we are discussing today, so the Minister need not worry.<br><br>
The purpose of clause 102, in broad terms, is to bring taxation of unapproved share option schemes into line with taxation of approved option schemes in respect of capital gains tax. It will bring the law into line with practice. However, it begs the question: what is the distinction between unapproved and approved schemes? Parliament decided that there should be approved share option schemes and we agree with the principle. But one of the interesting developments in the past 10 years or so is that case law schemes—the unapproved schemes—have become much more popular than approved schemes for various reasons. That raises the interesting question: why should we have approved schemes? If we are to have them, should we do something more with them?<br><br>
I take no exception to clause 102, but why should we have approved schemes if the demand is for unapproved schemes? It is interesting that a comparatively small number of employees are in approved schemes, whereas 500,000 employees, possibly more, are in unapproved schemes. It is clear that, due to demand, the number of unapproved schemes is increasing.<br><br>
It would be helpful if the Minister told us why the Revenue developed the practice of imposing the tax regime in the same way as the approved schemes and why the clause exists. The original intention was to establish a clear distinction between an approved and an unapproved scheme, but that is slowly beginning to dwindle. I see no point in prolonging a fiction or doing something that plainly goes against the grain, but we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
must ask ourselves why approved schemes will exist is unapproved schemes benefit from the same type of tax advantages. What is the Government's thinking behind that?<br><br>
For the purposes of academics and others we study our proceedings, I should stress again that we strongly believe that employees should be encouraged to take part in share option schemes, provided that they exist to reward success and to encourage greater participation and are available to everyone from the board room to the shop floor. We shall return to that issue during discussions on clause 110. We want to encourage the thinking behind option schemes, but we must ask ourselves collectively—this is not a point between one side of the Committee and the other—why there should be approved and unapproved schemes if, at the end of the day, there is no difference between them.<br><br>
For understandable reasons, the whole question of share options has been widely debated in newspaper columns, on television and elsewhere. It is important to concentrate on the fact that despite the abuses of schemes by certain board-room members of the privatised utilities, share options have generally been very popular. We want to encourage them because they give people a greater stake in their companies from board room to shop floor.<br><br>
What is the Government's thinking on the two schemes? If unapproved schemes will attract the same tax incentives as approved schemes, why are we bothering with approved schemes in the first place? This being the Committee stage, we have the opportunity to make further contributions if we catch your eye, Mr. Hill. I see that the Minister might be able to help us and it might focus the debate were he to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central might have misunderstood ever so slightly what clause 102 is about. I shall try to help him.<br><br>
The principle focus of the clause is very narrow. It aims to address how capital gains tax interacts with the granting of options at the moment when the options are granted. For unapproved schemes, there was a complication in that a capital gains liability could have been identified because the option was deemed to have had a value at the time when it was granted. The clause aims to make the capital gains tax treatment at the time of granting the option the same as that for approved schemes. Subsequent tax treatment for those who have options under unapproved and approved schemes diverges at that point.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will understand that, subsequently, advantages are traded off against the limitations of the approved schemes. For example, at the point when the option is exercised, an unapproved scheme gives the person who exercised the option at that time an income tax liability. That is not the case for a person in an approved scheme. The clause tries to remove an unnecessary complication in dealing with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
an element of capital gains tax at the time when the option is granted and to bring the unapproved and approved schemes into line on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether that was an intervention or a speech. I understand the point, which is fairly narrow, but it begs the question of why we have approved schemes rather than unapproved schemes if, gradually, we give the same tax advantages to both. That is a fundamental point. If the Government's intention is to consider only one narrow aspect of the tax system, we should know that. I raise the issue because it is striking how infinitely more popular are unapproved share option schemes than approved ones. That is clear from how schemes have operated over the past few years.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
When it was launched, the approved scheme came with all sorts of tax advantages—the carrot to get people involved. Once tax advantages are built into a scheme, there are certain to be anomalies and differences between it and unapproved schemes. If we do not distinguish—in this measure and others—between approved and unapproved schemes, what is the point of maintaining them? Other factors affect popularity. For example, approved schemes have to be more widely based: they have to be all-encompassing whereas unapproved schemes do not.<br><br>
My question to the Minister is fundamental. We do not propose to vote against the clause, but it begs the crucial question—what will be the future of the approved schemes if unapproved schemes gradually obtain the same advantages? We must consider that issue before we go down the road of granting more concessions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow up those questions as I am worried about the clause. There is cross-party agreement on share option schemes when companies provide a stake for people in their working lives. We have no disagreement over that. However, the Minister's answer to the question put my hon. Friend the Minister for Edinburgh, Central—about the continuance of approved and unapproved schemes—was unclear.<br><br>
There is a further question that should be put to the Government whenever they talk about profit-related pay or share options. An element of humbug often enters the debate. We all agree that employees need a greater stake in their companies, but there is widespread disagreement over the influence of different classes of employees. There is a huge differential in the influence and control that employees can exercise within a company when they take up share options.<br><br>
The clause does not get to the nub of the problem because the Government are concerned only with differential liability to individuals. They do not address the more fundamental issue of the influence that becoming a share owner in a company may add to someone's working life.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends', I generally welcome the clause. From an employer's perspective, it provides an incentive to issue share options. Previously, the employer would have been deemed to receive market value on grounds of a discounted option; the employer will now be taxed by reference to the actual amount paid. My main reservation is that once again these are discretionary schemes whereas we would prefer all-employee schemes.<br><br>
My question relates to the other side of the equation—from the perspective of the employee. Revenue document 7 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"any capital gains liability on employees on sale of shares acquired through exercising such options will be computed by reference to the amount actually paid for the options rather than their market value."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that as there appears to be some confusion? Does it mean that the employee in unapproved schemes will be subject to double taxation, since the employee will already have been taxed on realising the shares by reference to the difference between the market value and the initial value of the shares? We need some clarification on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I welcome the clause since I have spoken to a number of different tax advisers who say different things about its effect. I have heard what the Minister says but I remain confused about the practical effect of the clause on the business community. I strongly suspect that it will encourage the use of unapproved rather than approved share option schemes because changes in legislation have made it more advantageous for companies that want to offer share option schemes below market value to go down the unapproved option route. The loophole has been closed as a result of changes to discretionary share option schemes.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that a public limited company wanting to issue an approved or unapproved option scheme will have to gain shareholder approval under listing requirements and that that will not apply to companies that are not public limited companies? I presume that the second step after securing shareholder approval will be to institute a scheme by reference to the Greenbury code, although that is not statutorily required at present. Companies wanting to offer shares at below market value to directors will have only the route of the unapproved option scheme—aside from save-as-you-earn schemes which are separate. The incentive will be there because fewer regulations apply to the unapproved route.<br><br>
The only differences between approved and unapproved share options schemes are two-fold—the 30 per cent. limit and the fact that income liability crystallises on the disposal of shares as opposed to the exercise of the share option. If the Minister could confirm that those are the main differences, in addition to the difference that unapproved schemes can be granted below market value, it would clear up the situation. Will he explain again exactly what the clause does in terms of capital gains tax changes and what the situation was before the Bill was introduced? To what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
extent was the Inland Revenue chasing those CGT liabilities previously? To what extent are we trying to regulate on a matter that the Revenue perhaps turned a blind eye to in the past, for understandable reasons?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The danger of leaping into such debates without setting the ground rules is that we cannot always clarify our terms. I shall pick up from the point at which the hon. Member for Dudley, West stopped speaking. There is no effort or attempt by the Revenue to turn a blind eye.<br><br>
At the risk of boring the Committee, I shall try to give some detail on what this narrow clause does. It deals with an anomaly in the capital gains rules that apply to the grant of unapproved employee share options. Approved scheme options attract tax relief that is not available to unapproved scheme options. The clause does not change that. It simply focuses on the different capital gains treatment that applies on the grant of the option. It substitutes any real-world payments made when the option is granted for the market value of the option in computing any capital gains liability. That is how the grant of approved options is currently dealt with.<br><br>
The clause will enable the capital gains computation for all employee share options to be based on the true gain. It will also greatly simplify matters for companies and option holders by avoiding the need for difficult valuations. The clause has been widely welcomed in consultation.<br><br>
Under the current rules the grant of an option is a chargeable event for capital gains tax purposes. Company grantors are liable to corporation tax on chargeable gains which is based on the amount that they receive for options where they are granted under an approved scheme, but on the market value of options for unapproved schemes.<br><br>
Determining the market value of the right to acquire shares is not easy and creates uncertainty for employers. The whole exercise can be a waste of time if the grantor company later issues new shares when the options are exercised. Under general capital gains tax rules, any earlier corporation tax liability on the company then falls away.<br><br>
Option holders will not generally be liable to capital gains tax until they sell their shares. However, the acquisition cost of the option—as opposed to the cost of the shares themselves—will be the market value of the option in the case of unapproved share scheme options, but the amount paid for the option where the scheme is an approved one. There is no case in principle for that difference in tax treatment between approved and unapproved share scheme options. The need to value options creates unnecessary work for companies and the Revenue and makes it difficult for option holders to compute their capital gains tax liability when they sell their shares.<br><br>
That is the official position. I hope it clarifies the narrowness of clause 102. However, there is a trade
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
off. If an individual option holder wants to gain the tax break benefits under the company share option plan, he trades away the ability to have limitless options for a cap on those options. Judging by the many thousands of people who wrote to the Treasury after my right hon. and learned Friend's announcement on 17 July, one of the key concerns was an individual's wish to maintain in approved share options the ability to avoid the payment of income tax at the time when the options were exercised, as opposed to granted. In an unapproved share scheme, an individual has an immediate liability to income tax at the time when he exercises those options. We are not in any way changing that crucial distinction between the approved and the unapproved scheme.<br><br>
The term "approved" should be defined. I hope that will allow the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and I to share some common ground. Approved share option schemes are not confined solely to the terms of the company share option plan, which the House approved at the beginning of our deliberations. They also incorporate the save-as-you-earn and the profit sharing schemes. The straightforward company share option plans are less popular numerically than the save-as-you-earn and the profit sharing schemes. That reflects companies' attitudes towards that scheme as opposed to the profit sharing scheme, with its important tax breaks, and the save-as-you-earn scheme. Those schemes are relatively accessible, and we intend to improve that.<br><br>
All three schemes add up to an important package, and we improved all three as a result of wider Government policy to encourage greater share ownership. We have retained, sustained and even developed the company share option plan after broad representations to us—people want it to be retained.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
By virtue of those representations, it was clear that people wanted to maintain a clear distinction between the tax treatment in an approved company share option plan and the different treatment in an unapproved scheme. It is always a question of horses for courses. Companies can decide which scheme suits them and whether to have a save-as-you-earn or a profit-sharing scheme in addition to a company share option plan. Each scheme has unique characteristics, but each approved scheme seeks to give a tax benefit to those who participate in their company's equities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary address the main thrust of our comments—the differences between the approved and unapproved schemes? When the Government considered changes to the unapproved share option schemes, did they address the relative unpopularity of approved share option schemes to discover what could be done to make them more attractive, or did they simply address the narrow question of capital gains tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but, as far as the relevant tax treatments in the different
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
schemes are concerned, it was his hon. Friends who took the debate into the realms of unclarity. When the so-called executive share option schemes ended—his party had some sympathy with that policy—people told the Government that they wanted schemes such as the company share option plan, which the House had approved. They did so because they saw that they were tailored to the needs of the less well paid employees in their companies, their middle managers. They wanted to use the scheme to involve many of their employees in equity participation in the company and to give them a stake in the business. By producing the company share option plan, the Government did precisely what many companies had asked them to do. The debate with them had the benefit of flushing out where the real need was.<br><br>
I look forward to companies being able to achieve equity participation through the company share option plan or the other two plans. We shall later have the opportunity to debate the Government's efforts to improve the ease and popularity of participation in company equity plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the answer to my question was buried in there somewhere, but I did not hear it. I shall, therefore, repeat my point. Under an unapproved scheme, an employee will already have been charged income tax on the excess of the market value of the shares over the price that was paid for the unapproved option. The section on the simplification of the capital gains treatment of employee share options in Revenue note 7 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"any capital gains liability on employees on sale of shares acquired through exercising such options will be computed by reference to the amount actually paid for the options rather than their market value".</p></blockquote>
I was making a point about income that has already been covered by income tax—the gap between the market value and the price actually paid for the option. Does the Minister agree that there is an element of double taxation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us try to separate the company's capital gains tax liability in respect of any options which it grants from an individual's capital gains tax liability when he comes to sell the shares. All that clause 102 does is to establish that what the company gets from people when they exercise their options—they have to pay for them—is the gain. As far as capital gains tax liability is concerned, that is a common formula for both approved and unapproved share schemes. When a person comes to sell his shares, he might have an individual liability to capital gains, which will be computed in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the Minister spoke interestingly about a conflict between old and new language—he was discussing the simplification of the taxation system. Is this a case in point? If an academic analysed the proceedings, he would find a conflict of language: the Minister discussed defining the narrow term, but the broad thrust of Opposition's argument has been that there are two schemes, approved and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
unapproved, and that the balance of schemes are unapproved. The clause brings the two schemes closer together.<br><br>
How does the Minister envisage the future? How will the clause affect the future? What will the balance be between the two schemes in future and will they merge at some point to become a third scheme? That is our simple, although wide, point. Can the Minister try to address it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to address it. The clause deals with the starting point—the actual basis of a capital gains tax liability at the time when the options are granted. From that point, the tax treatment of the two schemes diverges. We have no plans to change the different tax treatment of the individual option-holder because that has been the subject of the Government's considerations and is the subject of clause 105 about share option plans.<br><br>
In terms of widening the popularity of other approved schemes, we shall debate the detail later. Our task is to put weight behind improving the accessibility and, I hope, the popularity of the approved schemes with their various tax breaks and not to encourage unapproved schemes in any way. That is a matter for individual companies and individuals if they want to go down that route.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's final sentence still does not answer the point about the greater popularity of unapproved schemes. I want to press the Minister about what research and investigation he has undertaken to understand that greater popularity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Lady supply the statistics that underpin that popularity point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central that unapproved schemes are substantially more popular than approved schemes. There is a simple question, which the Minister has not answered in his response to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked my question because we do not have a figure. There is no need to tell the Revenue if one has an unapproved scheme. That is why I asked where the hon. Lady had got her information from. I accept that there are differences in popularity between the three so-called approved share option schemes, as I have outlined.<br><br>
The thrust of this clause, and subsequent clauses in this chapter, is to enhance and improve the popularity of approved schemes. It is not our intention to run some competition to assist unapproved schemes. People want unapproved schemes and are entitled to join such schemes. Our thrust is to put weight behind improving the take-up of approved share option schemes, which is why the Government give tax breaks, albeit in a limited form, to approved share option schemes and do not give tax breaks to unapproved schemes.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0406">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
I hope that I have made the position entirely clear. The clauses are in response to what people have asked us to do. We shall debate this matter in more detail. The company share option plan, save-as-you-earn improvements and profit-sharing improvements have been developed in response to representations that we have received. We agree with those who want approved schemes to be developed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the difficulty for Opposition Members is that this is a simplification measure directed particularly at unquoted companies. Anyone who has ever tried to agree a theoretical market value with a share valuation division will know that it is a complex and time-consuming process on behalf of both the Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. The clause will deal with that problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification. I hope that between us we have shone some light on the subject.<br><br>
I appreciate that words said in Committee do not always provide absolute clarity and I am happy to be pressed on this point further. We have moved away from the old executive share option scheme, which was the subject of much criticism, to a regime of approved share option schemes, which now seem to have general popular support. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary wrote to 250 companies in the United Kingdom asking whether they welcomed the proposals, including the one contained in clause 102. They welcomed it and looked forward to contributing to the improvement we propose in these clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Leith and for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson) on having drawn the Financial Secretary on the Government's intentions. I said at the outset that this is a narrow change to the capital gains tax regime and not one with which I take issue, but we are entitled to ask the Government about their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
intentions. The reason I do so—without wishing to introduce any rancour into our proceedings—is that, having regard to the Government's track record on this matter, we are entitled to ask them for their view on approved and unapproved schemes.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary mentioned the company share option schemes: I did not do so as they are covered by clause 105, which we have dealt with, and I was doing my best not to be brought to the ground by the Chairman too early in the proceedings. We shall deal with more specific schemes later. But concern has been expressed that, although there are a number of approved schemes, unapproved schemes are more popular. I know what the Minister is going to ask me, but I cannot quote chapter and verse on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman does not have the data to substantiate the allegation that unapproved schemes are more popular, but does he agree with me that the number of individuals who participate in approved schemes exceeds the number of individuals who participate in unapproved schemes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not able to deal with that point. We are entitled to know the Government's position on this matter. Eventually, the Financial Secretary said that the Government proposed to make technical changes, but they did not intend to make more substantial changes. To that extent, the debate has been useful.<br><br>
I conclude by making the point that for the Government to claim that clause 105 is a response to a consultative exercise is nonsense. The Government were forced to abandon executive share option schemes because of the public outrage at the abuse by people in privatised utilities. That is why they made these changes and for no other reason.</span></p>
