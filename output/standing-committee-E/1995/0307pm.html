<br><br><!-- lb -->
An amendment tabled last year by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was passed as a result of which a report was published. It is an excellent, interesting report although it did not take us any further forward. I had assumed—as many people had—that Customs and Excise would be included in the review. Tax legislation has grown enormously over the past 25 years, which is acknowledged in the summary and in the background paper. We have constantly to strike a balance between simplifying the tax system without undermining the integrity of the tax base. Simplification is not always possible and there are times when tax legislation is bound to be complex, but it is in the interests of all those who follow these debates, regardless of their political affiliation, that we try to make the amendment of current legislation or the introduction of new systems such as self-assessment—which we have debated at length—as simple as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interim report on tax legislation from the tax law review committee said:
	<br><q><p>"We believe something more fundamental is wrong with our tax system than the rate at which it is being produced. The style in which it is written has been likened to a puzzle—and one which does not have a picture on the box! It is impenetrable; you cannot see even the broad outline of the picture until you have solved the puzzle. Worse still, there are times when the legislation is wholly incomprehensible. This is unacceptable."</p></q>
At times in our debate, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have struggled with the complexity of some proposals. With the development of taxation legislation within Customs and Excise, there has been a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>758</span>
propensity to move to the use of statutory instruments: for instance, in the period from 1992 to the current year, 136 statutory instruments covering tax within Customs and Excise have been issued. We have considerably less ability to scrutinise and amend that legislation. Guidelines and further statutory instruments will be issued, on the landfill tax proposals, covering crucial aspects of the operation of the tax, with little time for Parliament to scrutinise them. The Budget changes made by statutory instrument already in the pipeline as a result of the Bill cover many areas still to be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of reports have been produced on tax simplification, the principle of simplification as an objective and the balancing of simplification with the principles of tax collection. We must not encourage avoidance strategies. In the global market, simplification has to be balanced against international considerations. It is not always possible to achieve the straight objective of simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Accounts Select Committee, in its 41st report during the 1993–94 Session, considered the cost to business of complying with the requirements of value added tax, the complexity of that tax and the burdens placed on small businesses. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in March 1994 entitled "HM Customs and Excise: Cost to Business of Complying with VAT Requirements" took that debate a little further. The summary of its conclusions referred to points that should be considered when examining tax legislation, such as simplification, ease of reference and plain language drafting of current and future legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Comptroller and Auditor General's report says that we should safeguard the tax base and should avoid the additional risks to revenue collection from avoidance and evasion. It also says that as VAT is a self-assessed tax, it inevitably involves traders in extra costs. It makes various recommendations about the support that should be given to traders. It refers to balancing complexity with fairness and equity and says that it is not always possible to achieve the goal of simplifying the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged that there have been some
	<br><q><p>"notable achievements in working to simplify initial proposals"—</p></q>
on VAT legislation—
	<br><q><p>"tabled in Brussels for regulations to implement the Single European Market."</p></q>
He said that Customs and Excise had done a great deal in those negotiations to further the objective of simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5(b) of the report identifies
	<br><q><p>"key elements of any programme to ensure that traders' compliance costs are kept to a minimum"</p></q>
and to ensure that the tax base is protected. The report recommends a regular
	<br><q><p>"review of the regulatory framework, identifying the elements of primary law on which each regulation is based and possible areas of flexibility consistent with European Community law".</p></q>
It says that there needs to be
	<br><q><p>"an analysis of where the main compliance costs on traders arise and which elements of traders' costs arise from which aspects of the regulations".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>759</span>
It also says that, based on those analyses, a strategy should be embarked on for simplification of existing regulations, with clear targets for the number of regulations to be reviewed for simplification each year. The report goes on to say that monitoring should take place to follow up expected benefits, structural change should be developed at the European level and there should be clear and consistent reporting of progress in reducing compliance costs. It identified the many benefits that could be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In part II on simplifying regulations and procedures, the report looked at how to assist traders at the lower end of the VAT registration threshold. On 1 March, a written answer from the Paymaster General was published in 	<i>Hansard,</i> setting out some of the steps that Customs and Excise has taken to work with Inland Revenue to progress the objectives. It made particular reference to the LEGIS programme with its two goals of, first, convergence and simplification of common procedures and, secondly, simplifying the structure of law consolidating revised legal provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no complaint, but that does not so far enough. We should like to see a report based on the same structure as the one completed by the Inland Revenue, called "The Path to Tax Simplification". That report does not have all the answers, but it sets out problems clearly and reviews the arguments of those who criticise current tax legislation—rightly juxtaposed with Treasury priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither "The Path to Tax Simplification" nor the Paymaster General's written answer of 1 March to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield refers to consultation in relevant areas. The failure to include Customs and Excise in the first exercise is an oversight. We hope that the Government will agree that the exercise is worth while and that they will publish the results so that we can all have the benefit of the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that it was an oversight that section 160 of the Finance Act 1995 did not apply to Customs and Excise. However, since I drafted it, I can tell her that it was not an oversight. She should not have been surprised that the report did not include Customs and Excise; it was deliberately aimed at the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the report that was published in December. I consider it a major step forward. It demonstrates an important change of attitude within the Inland Revenue, which now accepts that simplification is desirable. There is now also the political will to achieve it. We must recognise, though, that it is a major undertaking. We are talking about five years and very substantial resources. We are only at the start of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extension to Customs and Excise would be premature. In any case, the lion's share of provisions in any Finance Bill belongs to the Inland Revenue. This Bill contains 64 Customs and Excise clauses, 124 Revenue clauses and three clauses that apply to both. That is slightly misleading, because the Bill includes a completely new tax—the landfill tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday, the chairman of Customs and Excise, Mrs. Strachan, will give evidence to the Public Accounts Select Committee. In his report to the Committee, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>760</span>
Comptroller and Auditor General noted that Customs and Excise has had to deal with three new taxes—the first since the introduction of VAT in 1993. Those are air passenger duty, insurance premium tax and the lottery levy—the landfill tax is now the fourth. That gives us a distorted picture, however. Four of the schedules, apply to Customs and Excise, 32 to the Revenue, and one to both. We should, therefore, wait and see how the Inland Revenue gets on with that ambitious programme and return to the Customs and Excise portion later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General gave an extremely helpful and informative reply to a written question that I tabled. I asked what progress Customs and Excise had made on simplifying tax law. I was pleased to read that
	<br><q><p>"Customs … shares with Inland Revenue the objective of seeking to simplify legislation and reduce burdens on business."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> I March 1996; Vol. 272, c. 777.1</p></q>
My right hon. Friend also said that significant differences exist between the roles of Customs and the Inland Revenue, and I accept that. Most, if not all, Inland Revenue legislation is contained in Finance Acts. My right hon. Friend notes, however, that much Customs legislation is contained in other Acts, because Customs and Excise administers taxes and duties, and has a wide range of other responsibilities. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, we should not accede to the new clause. We should discover how the Inland Revenue simplification programme proceeds. Customs and Excise legislation is complex; indeed, much of it is not contained in primary legislation at all, but in regulations. There is scope for simplification, but we should not be overambitious about it. We shall clearly have to tackle it in chunks and on a piecemeal basis, starting with the Inland Revenue. I am pleased at my right hon. Friend's assurance that Customs is committed to simplification and deregulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David HeathcoatAmory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would replicate in all but minor detail section 160 of last year's Finance Act. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, however, a simplification project is already under way; indeed, I announced it last June. Although I genuinely welcome the pressure that my hon. Friend and others have applied to make our statutes more comprehensible, the Government are already committed to that goal, and I have already given details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make the general point—it applies as much to direct taxes as to those for which I am responsible—that there is sometimes a conflict between fairness and simplicity. There is a dangerous temptation for politicians to do too much with the tax system and to tune it to achieve all manner of social, redistributive and environmental aims. That is always done with the best intentions, but it can complicate statutes. As a result, the public sometimes resist simplification, and I can give several examples. One—from the direct tax field—is the indexation of capital gains tax, which is undoubtedly extremely complex. If it were unilaterally withdrawn, however, that would be resented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in my own field of VAT, the Government introduced cash accounting in 1987. That was widely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>761</span>
welcomed at the time, particularly by small businesses, which felt that they should have to pay VAT not on an invoice basis but on a cash received and cash paid basis. That provision undoubtedly made the statute more complex, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have said enough to indicate that what we are trying to do is not uncontroversial and certainly not easy. Even during our debates on the Bill, some hon. Members have been tempted to urge complexity. For instance, while we proposed two bands for the landfill tax, the Opposition wanted three, with a higher band at £15. They undoubtedly felt that that was environmentally justified, but it would have made the Bill longer, would have complicated the secondary legislation and would have been an additional burden for administrators and taxpayers to cope with. If we are serious about deregulation and simplification, we must be careful to do it as well as to talk about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield generously described the answer to his written question as helpful and informative. In it, I sought to draw attention to the similarities and also the differences between Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, which mean that an identical approach to them is not possible. For instance, the answer draws out the fact that many of the complexities of VAT are imported from EC directives, some of which were negotiated and signed many years ago. In a way, the founding Act was the sixth VAT directive, which was signed by the Labour Government in 1977. It is urgently in need of an overhaul, but it means that we do not have unilateral discretion in this matter—we must negotiate with 14 other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is that we have already launched the LEGIS project. I can confirm to the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo), who touched on the issue, that it will involve wide consultation. Its initial aim is to try to bring some harmonisation across the various taxes for which Customs and Excise is responsible. It is not clear to a newcomer why the various excise taxes and VAT all have different requirements for registration, payment methods, repayments and de-registration. The first job is to find out whether they can be made more logical and consistent. The secondary exercise—I am afraid that it is a long-term project—is to consolidate that in simpler statute law. It will take several years, but we have launched into the process with determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also mention that for any major changes to the statute or to new taxes, we always publish a compliance cost assessment. That in itself ensures that we are at least aware of the burden that we are placing on the business sector or on individuals through the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge members of the Committee to reject the new clause, not because the motives behind it are misguided but because we are doing so many of the things that it urges us to do. Furthermore, it would clash with work towards the next Budget. Even in this Bill, we have been able to make some simplifications—clause 20 is an example. I hope that we will be able to work out others for the next Budget. In relation to EC law, we have enacted certain provisions flowing from the second tax simplification directive. Again, more legislation might be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>762</span>
required for the next Budget. It would get in the way of that were officials and Minrs to be taken off those duties to produce a report which, however interesting, would not achieve what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that we are committed to the task of deregulation and simplification, but that the new clause is not required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Paymaster General is trying to stretch points or to infer a line of argument that I was not pursuing. I said in my opening remarks that although simplification should be a goal, it had to be balanced against equity and the continued integrity of the tax base. Sometimes, issues have to be complex; there is no other way round them. It is not a straightforward matter of saying, "Simplify." Also, I do not believe that Customs and Excise is in a tax world all of its own, separate not only from the Inland Revenue but internationally in terms of the pressures and complexities that are placed on the administration of its tax regime in an increasingly global and sophisticated business market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Paymaster General at least to the summary of "The Path to Tax Simplification". Page 2, paragraph 3 refers to the Inland Revenue, although I do not understand why the principles do not apply to Customs and Excise as well. The paragraph states:
	<br><q><p>"The growth of Revenue legislation in recent years is not the result of the introduction of new taxes. Since 1980, more direct taxes have been abolished … than have been introduced … Existing taxes, on the other hand"—</p></q>
particularly indirect taxes
	<br><q><p>"have on balance become more elaborate. This reflects … deliberate tax reform"</p></q>
self-assessment is an example
	<br><q><p>"the need to respond to an increasingly global and sophisticated business environment … the need to respond to changes in the general legal framework within which business and other taxpayers operate … the increasing desire for tax law to be detailed and precise so that it is certain in its application".</p></q>
That applies just as much to the taxes raised through Customs and Excise as it does to the Inland Revenue. Indeed, the 41st report of the Public Accounts Committee stated in its summary and recommendations:
	<br><q><p>"Overall, complexity in the VAT regime will tend to increase the costs of compliance, and we note with concern that there are 156 main regulations affecting the operation of VAT and that since 1985 there have been 209 regulatory changes."</p></q>
The report goes on:
	<br><q><p>"We note the Department's assessment"—</p></q>
the Deparment in question being Customs and Excise
	<br><q><p>"that only 20 per cent. of traders fully understand the VAT regime."</p></q>
Those traders collect tax on our behalf, but they do not fully understand the regime. I am prepared to accept that in the year since, that 20 per cent. might have risen; It cannot be anywhere near half of all traders, but a serious problem exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continues:
	<br><q><p>"We are concerned that the Department's officers find underdeclarations of VAT at some 55 per cent. of traders visited, and that in 1992–93, underdeclarations of VAT amounted to some £2,000 million."</p></q>
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that we cannot give that problem a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>763</span>
priority when such a large amount of revenue is at stake is not acceptable. I have every confidence that the civil servants in Customs and Excise can work with as much vigour as those in the Inland Revenue and produce the report for us. Otherwise, the same excuse will be trotted out: "We know it's difficult and complex but we don't have time to change it so we'll just keep on building on the same foundations."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At some stage, whichever party is in power, that problem will have to be tackled. We accept that that will not be done overnight. It will be a long process, but we want the Government to start that process. They should not be complacent and tell us that the matter is in hand and that no more needs to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause stands in my name and in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) and for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg). You will recall, Mr. Hill, that I moved this clause—in an identical form but with a different number—during proceedings on last year's Finance Bill. I do not apologise for that—on the contrary, it is often sensible to try to modulate our tax legislation as we go on. The Government and the Inland Revenue often need time to consider proposed changes, and it has never been my intention to bulldoze through a clause that has not been considered properly. I am sure that the Government will have had time to deliberate on the contents of the clause since I first moved it last year, as have I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to concede that there has not been a great deal of vocal agitation for the clause. There have not been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>764</span>
demonstrations in Parliament square, nor are our mailbags weighed down by representations from our constituents, but I make no apology for raising the matter; it is often sensible for us to be anticipatory rather than reactive in the changes that we make to the Taxes Act 1988. A few years ago, I proposed some changes to section 79 of a tax Act relating to the taxation of fund managers with overseas portfolios and to the tax treatment of certain derivative products. Again, the anomalies in the Act had not caused many practical problems, but I am convinced that had those changes not be made by the Government, people would have suffered from problems. Moreover, it is right for us to remove anomalies and unfairnesses, which may have unfortunate human and economic consequences, even if the numbers of people affected are relatively modest. In some ways so it is easier to do the right thing if the cost of doing so is modest, especially when the Government are rightly concerned not to lose any source of revenue and when, therefore, the bias will naturally be against accepting any changes that will have significant revenue costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the new clause can be described in a few short sentences. It would clarify, simplify, make more fair and rationalise—but not abolish—the two thirds rule applied by the Inland Revenue to ensure that pension provisions that qualify for the various tax inducements should not deliver pensions that are worth more than two thirds of the pensioners' salary. At present, that is defined as a spinal salary; the taxpayer may choose between taking one of any of the five years of salary prior to retirement, or an average of three out of the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the taxpayer or pensioner had a higher income before that 10-year period—in other words, more than 10 years before retirement—that higher income is disregarded in relation to pensions. As I am sure that my hon Friend the Financial Secretary will remind the Committee, it is always open to employers to provide additional benefit by way of an unauthorised scheme, but such additional benefits will not qualify under existing tax inducements to ensure that employers and employees can provide for a reasonable pension; the cost to employers will be considerably greater, and they will not be able to offset the cost of such contributions as a business expense against income. That would be unfair and undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, I illustrated the unfairness of the present regime by taking a fanciful example. I said that the chief executive of British Gas might decide to retire at the age of 50 with a substantial pension, which would be a six-figure sum, because it related to his final salary of many hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. He might then take a job for 20 years as a teacher, on £20,000 a year. If one works for 20 years as a teacher, one would normally qualify for a pension of about half the final salary—£10,000—so the former chief executive would find himself limited by the application of the two thirds rule and of the one sixtieth rule to a pension of £7,000, and would lose £3,000. That would hardly cause hardship in that case, but it would be anomalous, unfair and unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In thinking further about the matter, I realised that I could take an example much closer to home. I am sure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>765</span>
that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will be, before long, a senior Cabinet Minister—he might be even more senior to that. If, after he had progressed through a distinguished career in the Government, he decided to return to the Back Benches for more than 10 years, he would find that the rule, which I am trying to modify to make it slightly more just and rational, would operate against his interests. The two-thirds rule would apply to his salary as a Back Bencher, not to the higher salary that he might have earned previously that would be unreasonable and unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more importantly, it makes no sense for society or for the country to discourage anyone from taking a less well paid role after a more highly paid role, to take a more modest position after having had a rather more grand position. What is wrong with moving from the boardroom to the shop floor? It may be unusual, but those who do so deserve some accolade and respect for such a decision. They should not be penalised for it. Above all, they would not deserve a lesser pension entitlement for the same amount of work, over the same number of years and for the same rate of pay as their colleagues on the shop floor. I give way to my hon. Friend, one of the other sponsors of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend gave as an example our hon. Friend the Financial Secretary achieving high office and then returning to the Back Benches. Another example would be more mature people who have been highly rewarded in the private sector wanting to enter Parliament. They might be deterred from standing because of the adverse impact on their pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes my point perfectly, and better than I could have put it myself. There is no rhyme or reason why those who start by earning a high salary and who then come to Parliament—which I believe to be an honourable profession—should be disadvantaged by the operation of the two thirds rule as it is currently framed, but that those who start in Parliament and then go on to earn a high salary elsewhere should not be disadvantaged. My hon. Friend makes the point very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My objective is quite simply to ensure that there is no disincentive in the pension tax regime to people changing jobs, whether they take an increase in their salary or a decrease. That is a point of natural justice and evenhandedness. Those principles should be respected and enshrined in the Taxes Act 1988 and all other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An economic and social point also should be made. I dare say that the Taxes Act 1988 currently reflects something of a cliché—the conventional assumption that most people's salaries are static or progressive. As certain members of my party like to say—its a phrase that I do not often use myself—they are upwardly mobile. We live in a world of increasingly flexibly job opportunities. We all know that that system has many benefits in terms of the choice and variety of work available, which we should welcome. However, we know also that it sometimes creates insecurity and diffi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>766</span>
culties, and we should not seek to make those difficulties greater. We should not seek to falsify people's career choices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the new clause is in tune with the Government's view that people must be mobile and that labour must be flexible? People in their more mature years may otherwise be deterred from making job changes or, having left a company by being made redundant, may be deterred from seeking further work and making a positive contribution to the economy. The Government should support the new clause, which is in tune with the labour flexibility that we need in the modern economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's hope and expectation that the Government will be able to accept the new clause. I believe that, after due consideration, they will agree that an anomaly exists. I know that they would share my view that where there are anomalies, they should be honestly acknowledged and addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) in his excellent introduction to his new clause. His argument has a great deal of force, which is why I am a co-sponsor of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the new clause as one small step towards modernising the pension rules, which were established at a time when people expected to join a company and remain there until retirement, making a natural progression in responsibility and salary which would culminate in a triumphal departure at retirement, when they were presented with a clock or watch as a memento of their time with the company. Sadly—or perhaps not sadly—that is no longer the case. People's career patterns are much more flexible and alter greatly through their working life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pension rules should move forward to reflect that change. My hon. Friend's suggestion is one small move in that direction, and would make the pension rules for tax purposes reflect the realities of employment much more accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a more fundamental philosophical point behind my hon. Friend's new clause. As presently established, the pension rules distort people's freedom to decide how to structure their career. If people wish to take lower paid employment in the last few years of their working lives for whatever reason, they should be able to do so. The tax system and particularly the pension rules should not force them not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those two reasons, I urge my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to give the new clause serious consideration and to come to some arrangement, perhaps on Report, that would ameliorate the pension rules and make them more flexible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the new clause moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding. It is entirely in tune with modern times and recognises that people's working lives are changing. It is not uncommon for people to hold several jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>767</span>
As my hon. Friend pointed out, people who leave highly paid jobs may take more lowly paid jobs towards the end of their working lives, and it is unreasonable for the pension system to prejudice them against using their talents in the way that they wish as they approach retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if people who have had highly paid jobs decide not to retire, but to continue to devote their energies to the same profession at a lower level of pay or to move to an entirely different type of activity, that may be an advantage not only to them? It is a great advantage for society and the economy that they should continue to be active and their contribution should be available. We would be barmy to frame our tax laws in such a way as to induce them to retire and do nothing and thereby cease to contribute to society or the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Making such a point now has even more effect than when we debated the matter last year in discussions on the Finance Bill. Since that time, there has been much discussion about ageism and whether there is a bias against the older members of society and whether anything can be done to create a more level playing field and ensure that their talents are recognised. The new clause covers a specific measure in the Taxes Act 1988 that the Government may be able to do something about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practicalities of setting up an equal opportunities commission to overcome ageism are not realistic, but a problem exists in the legislation and it should be possible for the Government, as far-sighted as ours are, to make some changes. One of the current problems with the system of calculating pension entitlements is that a level playing field does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people take out a personal pension, they can overcome the problem, but they are penalised if they wish to stay within an occupational pension scheme. Not all employees will realise that problem. Why should we restrict people's choice and force them to go down a certain route to overcome it when a simple change to the Taxes Act 1988, as set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding in the new clause, would rectify the problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that sometimes, unwittingly, individuals may not know the details of tax and pensions law. A person might not know that his pension entitlement will not be increased when he takes a subsequent job at a lower rate of pay. He may start paying pension contributions in the expectation that he will have a higher pension, but he may not receive their full value. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding has moved a worthwhile new clause and I shall be most interested to hear the response of my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took the new clause very seriously, because people should not be derelict in their duties when giving proper consideration to pensions. It is an important matter. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South West said, there is much discussion about it. Before I settled down to read the briefing that I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>768</span>
had received on the technicalities, I was genuinely anxious to see if a real- world problem did exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I started my voyage of discovery with the debates on last year's Finance Bill. I read them carefully and I did not immediately recognise the problem. During our discussions, there was an intertwining of problems associated with someone who has continuous employment with one employer but at variable levels of earnings that were pensionable, as opposed to someone who may have separate employments and who derives a pension entitlement from each of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then read my briefing to gain some technical insight into the problems. I telephoned a provider of pensions in the real world to obtain a real-world view of the matter and to see if there really was a burning problem that needed a solution. Last Friday, I had a lengthy telephone conversation with that person to see if we could identify exactly what the problem was and to know whether it was a real-world difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Finance Bill last year, the debate centred on an example cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding of an employee who had earned £250,000 as his pension entitlement in the first employment and then went on to earn a salary of about £20,000 in the second employment. My hon. Friend postulated the position whereby the second employment and the pension deriving from it would be extinguished by virtue of the pension derived from the first employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way? There is a misunderstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, exactly. There was a misunderstanding because when I talked to people in the pensions industry who had read all the material—they follow these matters closely—they could not see what the problem was. I set off on my voyage of discovery to see whether I could identify the difficulty. My hon. Friend, who is an honourable man, would not be coming back for a third bite of the cherry were he not so troubled. He said last year, and again this year, that there was some injustice, which was replicated by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to be more positive and helpful, but I have to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding that there is a technical deficiency in the drafting of the new clause if it is intended to address the problems that he enunciated. The new clause refers to emoluments during the employment and does not allow reference to be made to any employment other than the last one. My hon. Friend felt that there was some confusion and I shall gladly give way to allow him to pursue that point before I make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a small point that I want to clarify so that there is no misunderstanding. My hon. Friend the Minister suggested that I referred to the pension from the second employment being extinguished by the existence of a pension from the earlier employment. Of course, it would not be extinguished, and I made that clear in my speech. The effect of the one sixtieth rule is that a pensioner can claim one sixtieth for each year worked in relation to the second or subsequent employment. The pensioner would be unable to claim full entitlement in the event that the second pension scheme provided for pension
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>769</span>
entitlement to accumulate at a higher rate than one sixtieth of final salary for each year worked. In the event that the second scheme was based on one fiftieth, one fortieth or one thirtieth, which would be possible under the Inland Revenue rules, the difference between one sixtieth and the higher rate of accumulation of pension would be lost in circumstances when the earlier pension was higher. The word "extinguished" could have led to a misunderstanding and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to correct that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now revisited column 738 of our debate on 14 March 1995 to refresh my memory. I was not entirely accurate in describing the terms in which my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding worked out the examples, so I am grateful for the opportunity to do so, as that will help with our debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered carefully the points made by all members of the Committee who have spoken, the first of which concerned difficulties with pensions during a single employment, when earnings varied over a lifetime, to see the position within the terms of the existing rules. There is a case to be made showing that the existing rules are very flexible indeed. In determining and taking into account the variable nature of people's earnings, my hon. Friend talked about the final salary position relating to the last five years of employment before retirement. He will also know that that final earning position can be based on an average of any three or more consecutive earnings for a period ending within 10 years of retirement. In other words, a 13-year period of employment could stretch back when determining someone's pension. That matter was touched on in last year's debate but not with precision and clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the real world, for people with a single employment, there is flexibility in the rules and individuals can top up their pensions with additional voluntary contributions. Obviously there are other ways of saving for their future. I do not genuinely see a problem with how the pension rules for someone with a single employment are framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding then dealt with the question of people who have separate employments. Let us consider such cases. If someone has one or more employments and derives a pension from each based on the one sixtieth principle, there would be no problem in allowing the full effect of the pension earned in one employment to be added to the full effect of the pension earned in the second employment. Therefore, no interaction between final salary benefits should prevent those who go from employment to employment gathering pensions from enjoying the full fruits of their labours and contributions to their pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem arises—my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding touched upon this matter at the end of his speech—when people enter employments in which they are subject to an accelerated rate of contributions based not on sixtieths but on thirtieths. As far as I can see, there can be a problem only when pensions in payment and again under the one-sixtieth rules interact with other pensions under the one-thirtieth rule. When
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>770</span>
those two pensions have been effectively added together and compared to the final pension under the one-sixtieth rule, a person who had the one thirtieth accumulation might have too much pension and, therefore, it might have to be reduced. That brings us back to the example that my hon. Friend. used to try to clarify the position. Only in such extreme circumstances, can such an interaction mean that people in a second employment might find that their pension is reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, certain things can be done about such problems. First, people already in receipt of a substantial pension can ask about the terms of pension arrangements for the second and subsequent employment and, therefore, work out the position. Perhaps, they could negotiate with their second employer not to have an accelerated path because the basic minimum requirement for tax-approved occupational pension schemes is that it pays on sixtieths. People could negotiate to decrease the benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if employers want to reward people without causing such a conflict, they could provide an unapproved scheme under which additional contributions could be made to the advantage of those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my hon. Friend's concept of an unapproved scheme. Would an unapproved scheme have the tax privileges of an approved scheme:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend seeks to trip me up. The short answer is that, by definition, unapproved schemes do not have a tax break for individuals because they are outwith the benefits. The point is that, in the real world, we are dealing with people who want to have full, decent pensions at the end of their second employment. Such people could negotiate schemes with their new employers which satisfied both so pension contributions would not be not wasted. I agree that such schemes would not be approved and, therefore, they would not attract tax benefits. However, the tax breaks for the occupational pensions scheme already cost between £7 billion and £8 billion. Therefore, in the real world, there are several escape routes from the narrow example that formed the basis of the case that my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding used last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to my voyage of discovery, I asked the person in the pensions industry whether there had ever been a real world example in which pension providers faced problems with customers—the people for whom pensions were provided. I asked whether that was a serious problem today. The answer was, "No." When I had the pleasure of discussing the matter with my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, he agreed that he could not provide me with an individual case study, other than the construct that was put to the Committee last year. It is fair to say that there is a potential problem that could affect an individual in the real world—albeit only in extreme cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements for occupational pensions are extremely flexible. I would not want my hon. Friends the Members for Fulham and for Milton Keynes, South-West to be left in any doubt that the current system for people in single employments with variable earnings is extremely flexible and caters for them. If people who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>771</span>
have second employments with a continuum of pensions on the one sixtieth rule, there is no problem—there is no interaction and loss of pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend says about people with single occupations. The point that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding were stressing was that, in today's economic climate, few people spend the whole of their working lives in one single employment. For example, no member of the Committee will manage to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely my point. I am anxious about that and recognise the real-world circumstances. I have changed jobs three times, and each time there has been a pension implication, so I have some practical experience of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's majority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give the hon. Gentleman the comfort of that job change, thank you very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If pensions from separate employments are based on the one sixtieth rule, there is no problem for someone who goes from one job to a second or third job. He suffers no interaction or deprivation of his pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding has pursued the matter assiduously, and I would like to tell him and my other hon. Friends that I am concerned about it. If people come back for a third bite of the cherry, they are still troubled, and it is wrong to leave people in that state of mind if there are ways to reconsider the matter. If my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding and those who have advised him would like to come to discuss the problem with me and my officials, I shall carefully consider the matter, especially if we can identify a real-world problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, following that analysis and after having checked with the pensions industry, we find a substantive problem—possibly even one that is waiting in the wings, because my hon. Friends made an important point about the variable nature of employments at present—I would certainly not rule out presenting a clause in a Finance Bill to deal with the problem. I hope that my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding will understand that at this early stage we do not even know what the size of the problem may be or what it might cost to deal with it. I hope that he will not expect me to go further than I have. I recognise his concern and will try to be as helpful as possible in my response, although his new clause is technically defective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for addressing the points that I and my hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, South-West and for Fulham have raised on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we make an effort to proceed logically when we address what are sometimes complexs problems, and do not spend time debating issues that have not been raised or do not exist. My hon. Friend mentioned the case of someone in the same employment who earns a lower salary at the end of his career than he earned earlier, and said that one of the ways in which that was already accommodated by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>772</span>
tax system was, under the 13-year rule. I referred to the fact that under the present rules, one could define final salary by reference to any one of the last five years of employment or any period of three years in the last 10 years of employment. My hon. Friend the Minister corrected me—I should not have said any three-year period in the last 10 years, but any period of three years that ended within the last 10 years. He is right; it works out then as any three-year period over the last 13 years. Over the years the Revenue—or perhaps parliamentary draftsmen—have developed extraordinary methods for defining these matters, which can be more confusing than helpful. I made it clear to my hon. Friend, however, that that was not satisfactory. The problem that I am addressing might well arise because someone's earnings had been higher more than 13 years before retirement. I gave an example of someone who had worked for 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an obvious example of where that may be the case—it is in my hon. Friend's experience as well as in my own. Traders in the dealing rooms of financial institutions typically make very high earnings in their 20s and 30s but then cease to have front-line trading responsibilities—it is hard to continue to be an active trader on a desk beyond the age of 40. They may then move into a settlements role, which would earn them a lower rate of pay, for the last 20 years of their working life. The circumstances that would then arise would not be taken into account by the current rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand: I referred to that in last year's debate, so I did not bring it up again, but with one or two professions—diving, for example—the Revenue has agreed certain extra-statutory regimes. However, it is thoroughly unsatisfactory that the Revenue should make ad hoc special agreements with certain professions. That is a fragmented and anomalous tax system. We should have clear rules, which are understood by everybody and which apply equally throughout the economy and society. It is not for the Government to say that a particular pattern of lifetime earnings is or is not deemed to be appropriate in this, that or the other profession. That is, if I may say so, an excess or dirigisme—of Whitehall knowing best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister suggested that AVCs might be part of the answer. Frankly, I was surprised to hear that. That is the worst possible advice that he could give to someone who finds himself in the position that I outlined. The AVCs cannot buy one through the two thirds rule. One would find oneself contributing to AVCs that then might not give any benefit at all—it would be written off because of the application of the two thirds rule. Far from being a solution, that would be a trap for the unwary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest I have made a mistake—I always apologise if I have given an inaccurate indication—I agree that in the narrow sense of the one thirtieth-one sixtieth interaction, AVCs would clearly be the wrong advice. I mentioned AVCs in the context of someone who had high earnings in a single employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend then said that he thought that the fact that the one sixtieth rule applied was part of the solution. Of course, as I have explained to him, it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>773</span>
not part of the solution; it is part of the problem. The one sixtieth rule is applied in the case to which I have tried to draw the Committee's attention. I know that I have done that at some length, but it seems to be necessary. That rule would override the entitlement that someone doing a given job would otherwise have to accumulate pension rights at the higher rate of one fiftieth, one fortieth or one thirtieth of the relevant salary level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister referred to what could be done. He said that there were solutions for individuals, one of which was that the individual could negotiate with his employers when he started his subsequent employment to accept a lower pension entitlement. That is not a solution to my problem; it is an acknowledgement that the problem exists. It is an acknowledgement that an injustice exists. It simply invites the taxpayer or the pensioner to acknowledge that he will be disadvantaged. That is not a solution to the problem, but it is—and I am grateful for this—a recognition that the problem exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then my hon. Friend the Minister suggested that the employer might provide an unapproved scheme, but my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West disposed of that. The whole point of the debate is to ensure that the tax regime that applies to pensions is fair, equitable and even-handed. To suggest that someone could solve the inequity of a tax regime by accepting that he was at a tax disadvantage will hardly solve the problem—although that at least acknowledges that there is a problem, for which I am grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister is gracious enough to recognise that I have given the matter a little thought. I take it seriously and do not intend to waste the Committee's or my time by raising the matter on a second occasion. I naturally listened with rapt attention to my hon. Friend's remarks. He said that he would be happy to introduce a proposal to address the anomaly to which I have referred if the Government could be persuaded that there was a "substantive" problem—I think that he meant "substantial", but let us leave it as "substantive" or "substantial"—and that the cost of remedying it was not too great. I was a little concerned by the juxtaposition of those two criteria, however, because one might deftly exclude the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand, I have to demonstrate that the problem is substantial. If I simply demonstrate that it exists in theory and that one or two poor individuals might fall into the trap, my hon. Friend will not feel that it is worth addressing the problem. On the other hand, I have to demonstrate that the revenue cost of making my proposed adjustment to the Taxes Act 1988 would not be significant or an obstacle to moving in the right direction. I recognise—as he will—that there is a fundamental logical contradiction in that. I might well be able to demonstrate that there is a substantive—but not necessarily substantial—problem and that a genuine anomaly and injustice exist, which do not apply to many people in practice. In that case, I would meet the first criterion, but not the second. If I met the second criterion, however, I might not meet the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for some assurance before the Committee takes a decision on the matter. If I can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>774</span>
demonstrate that there is an anomaly, an injustice and a fiscal deterrent to people to undertake the pattern of employment that I have outlined, will the Government address that in their own time and their own words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had given as helpful a response as I could on a problem that is not as clearly defined as it might be. Indeed, it is not quantifiable, and we cannot, therefore, estimate the cost of dealing with it even if we could properly identify it in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remind my hon. Friend that the rather unique circumstances that I described referred to someone who already had a large and substantial approved pension in his pocket. None the less, I shall reiterate my words for my hon. Friend. If, after proper consideration of my hon. Friend's arguments and his experts' views, there turns out to be a real-world problem, I would not rule out introducing a clause to deal with it. I seek my hon. Friend's assistance, however, to identify the problem, its size and the cost of tackling it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is as far as I can go in acknowledging that I do not dismiss my hon. Friend's line of argument, that I take his concerns seriously and that I want to explore them constructively with him. If there is a problem, I do not rule out future action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He flatters me by supposing that I have many advisers behind me—I wish that I commanded such expensive and distinguished helpers. Last year when I drafted the clause I asked a friend of mine in the City who is a leading tax lawyer to put pen to paper for me so that I did not make a fool of myself by producing wording that the Revenue or parliamentary draftsmen would immediately declare to be technically deficient. I do not have advisers behind me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in a quandary. I know my hon. Friend well: I know that he is a man of good faith who does not speak lightly, however serious his responsibilities. He may have to feel constrained about the degree of definiteness with which he gives assurances. In the light of what he said and in view of the understanding that I have gained from the discussion, I take it that if the Government are persuaded that an anomaly exists in the proposals put forward by me and my hon. Friends the Members for Fulham and for Milton Keynes, South-West that they will want to remove it. I see that my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic thrust of the three new clauses is to strengthen the role of ESOPs in our economy by providing more fiscal help than the Government have hitherto been willing to provide. I acknowledge that clause 110 is a step in the right direction. People who support the cause of ESOPs are grateful for the Financial Secretary's acceptance of that clause. However, we should consider going further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an unpaid director of Job Ownership Ltd., I should declare an interest. I also want to pay tribute to its co-director, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) who moved a similar clause last year. I pray in aid for these principles the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer who described ESOPs in his Budget speech as
	<br><q><p>"one of the most attractive features of what has become known as popular capitalism."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 November 1995; Vol. 267, c. 1068.]</p></q>
One of my new clauses specifically deals with business left unfinished by the right hon. and learned Gentleman's predecessor, now Lord Lawson, who said about relevant provisions in the Finance Act 1989:
	<br><q><p>"I hope that this will encourage more British companies, particularly in the unquoted sector, to consider setting up ESOPs."</p></q>
Regrettably, despite previous legislation and the good wishes of two Conservative Chancellors, ESOPs are, if not quite stillborn, at least stuck on the launch pad. Yet in the United States about 10,000 ESOPs have been created since 1974, covering about 10 million workers. We in the United Kingdom are still at a much more primitive stage. One of the most regrettable aspects of British ESOPs is that they contradict the plans' underlying philosophy—they are not concentrated in companies that are owned and largely managed by their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>777</span>
The research group New Bridge Street found that, following the ESOP legislation, more than 50 per cent. of the companies in the FTSE 100—the top 100 quoted companies in the United Kingdom—have an ESOP. That represents an increase of 68 per cent. in the past nine months alone. I accept that the Treasury's original intention was that the legislation would be used to give shares to companies' work forces. However, most ESOPs in this country are being used to service directors' long-term share schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from being an extension of popular capitalism, ESOPs have, unfortunately, often been used as a device to reward the people in our society who are already handsomely rewarded. The underlying philosophy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman just said that ESOPs were being used to serve the interests of directors. Does he include both statutory and case law ESOPs in that comment? Has he done any analysis to differentiate the two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:: I am quoting an excellent report provided by the House of Commons Library. I am talking about common law, or case law, ESOPs. The extra help that has been given to them has been directed—alas—more to the FTSE top 100 companies. The new clause would render ESOPs closer to the Government's original intention. That is not meant as a direct criticism, but ESOPs have failed to take off since they were first proposed in 1978 by Lord Healey. There has been only crab-like progress in extending ESOPs in the proper direction—the pluralisation of capitalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ESOP idea is to pluralise the ownership of companies in this country, which has the most concentrated ownership of almost any advanced OECD country. The United States has more than 11 million workers in the big ticket firms covered by such plans. A variety of different forms of ownership are apparent in the successful European economies. The trusts and co-operatives in various sectors add up to a pluralisation of the system of proprietorial ownership. Unfortunately, the United Kingdom philosophy concentrates on the plc and restricts the talent and energy of many managers and employees.

The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding has just left the Room, but the excellent document that he has written makes it hard to believe that he still sits on the Government Benches. In it he asserts
	<br><q><p>"Money should be the servant of Man, never its master."</p></q>
I welcome that remarkable statement, which sounds rather old Labour. One has to hope that that is the new approach of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make money the servant of man and not his master, it is useful to find mechanisms that will allow companies that want to establish an ESOP to do so as easily as possible. That includes family firms that do not want to sell out to a predator investor. I am thinking of privatisation: some of the most successful ESOPs have arisen from privatisation. The National Freight Company has, alas, lost its cutting edge precisely because our un-ESOP-friendly legislation meant that employees were encouraged to sell their shares to institutional
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>778</span>
investors. The National Freight Company became like any other company and ceased to have that enthusiastic engagement that made it such a success story in the 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tower colliery in south Wales was privatised last year. I do not know whether hon. Members saw the remarkable "Dispatches" programme—I have it on video: it lasts 90 minutes and I would be happy to run it for the Committee later when we have finished our formal meetings. The employees of the Tower colliery have to invest £8,000 to become members of the ESOP and a queue of them is willing to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were a professional—an accountant, a doctor or an architect—and I wanted to buy my way into a partnership, I would get tax relief on the money I put in. That is a significant inducement. Indeed, accountants say that they could not have had a stake in the partnership if it were not for the tax relief on the interest that they had to pay on a loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to obtain from the Financial Secretary facts and figures on the extent of the tax relief. He told me that 1.3 million people are partners in professional partnerships, but was unable to tell me the extent of tax relief. I also asked him about closed companies, but he was unable to give me any information. Directors in so-called closed companies also enjoy those tax privileges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, my new clauses seek to put those who wish to buy into ESOPs on a par with partners or directors of closed companies. I would like an answer on that. I do not accept that there should be one tax regime for accountants, doctors, lawyers and so on, and another for employees, managers and directors who want to become members of an ESOP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go into greater detail on other aspects of the new clauses when I reply to the debate, but I shall not seek to delay the Committee. This is an important issue. It is raised late on a Thursday afternoon when many hon. Members want to go home, but I put it to the Committee, the Government and, indeed, to my Front-Bench colleagues that if we want seriously to extend employee involvement, extend the nature of popular capitalism and use our tax laws to encourage and strengthen entrepreneurship and commitment, we should be bolder and more generous in our support for ESOPs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our consideration of the Bill and in the Budget announcements of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor, we have tried hard to respond to representations that have been made to us by various organisations, including Job Ownership Ltd. We listened carefully to those representations. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington, who is not presently in the Room, was pleased with Budget commitment to make important changes. We recognise that for various reasons there are differences in the take-up between statutory and case law ESOPs. We were particularly asked to enable ESOPs to interact with save-as-you-earn schemes—which is important—and we did so; we were also asked, in the context of management buy-outs of companies, to modify the rule that someone not participating in the ESOP has to be employed in the company for over a year, which may help generate greater employee participation in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>779</span>
long-term running of the company. I could have gone down the route that the hon. Gentleman wanted on both those requests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were not sure what the purpose of new clause 10 was and it was difficult to see why it was required; it seemed to suggest that an ESOP be established in a situation where it is not currently allowed—in a subsidiary company—but we are looking at all employees schemes in regard to statutory ESOPs. We were pressed hard by the Opposition to have all schemes as employee schemes; we responded to their points, but we had considered the matter earlier. The logical extension of the clause would be for the hon. Gentleman to advocate that a subsidiary not be available to the parent company, although there may be a deeper aspect to that which we should explore. It is difficult for me to comment when it is not clear what the new clause was about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but I must point out that companies create subsidiaries, often at a rate of knots, and that the legislation does not allow each subsidiary to become its own employee share ownership trust—ESOT—if it so desires. The purpose of the new clause is to allow the ESOP-ESOT principle to be extended across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A company can do that within existing law by its statutory ESOP and by ensuring that it extends that, as it is required to do, to all employees. That brings me on to new clause 11, in which the ESOT seems to become a warehousing operation for shares in the company. While I can understand that it might be attractive for the ownership to pass into the narrow ranges of the trustees of the trust, it is difficult to see how that complies with the hon. Gentleman's objective, which we share: to have the widest possible share participation. The best situation for any company is to try to get all its employees to take an equity interest in the business because that vital interaction of ownership results is what wider share ownership in a company is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we are that far apart. The new clause seeks to remove the obligation that all shares must be distributed to allow a kernel of a trust to be maintained holding shares beyond the present 20-year limit. The ESOP-ESOT mechanism is as the Financial Secretary has described it, but one also needs an institution that lasts longer than the employment period of an individual employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One has to look at all the possibilities of a clause if one is suggesting that it pass into law. The mechanism that the hon. Gentleman has defined would theoretically allow the trust to own 99 per cent. of the company, although in practice rules may be established to prevent that. The idea of holding a permanent, core section of the shares seems to go against what the hon. Gentleman began by saying: that he wanted the widest possible share ownership. For that reason I do not find new clause 11 particularly attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 12 was something of a surprise. Before I comment on the wider implications of what the hon. Gentleman said—I would not want him to put himself into an embarrassing position in relation to the rest-of his colleagues—the hon. Gentleman asked a specific
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>780</span>
question about partners. I think that there is a firm distinction between employees and partners who might well receive some assistance when they buy into a partnership because they have certain obligations. There is no obligation on employees to become shareholders. Indeed, the obligations once one becomes a partner are different because partners are jointly and severally liable without limit for any obligations incurred by the business. On the other hand, shareholders in a limited company are personally exposed to risk only to the extent of the amounts invested. There are substantial differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestions made by the hon. Member for Rotherham would effectively extend the opportunity of a tax break under new clause 12 to, as I understand it, all quoted companies which means that we would have the rather absurd situation that the so-called fat cats, who have been the butt of so much criticism from our opponents, could benefit from the proposal in that they could borrow money to become yet fatter cats. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Gentleman wanted to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have illustrated that there is a practical and technical deficiency with the three new clauses. Although I will be happy to continue the dialogue with the hon. Member for Rotherham and with my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding about what we can do to encourage wider share ownership, I must tell the hon. Member for Rotherham that the three new clauses are not quite the way to go about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Financial Secretary has not had time to read new clause 12, but it sets a clear upper limit which would qualify for the tax break so, in terms of the fat cats who concern us, the provisions in the new clause are merely small change-they would barely buy them a back seat in one of their Rollers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the small advances in the Bill to help ESOPs and for the courteous tone with which the Financial Secretary referred to the debate, but I regret that we advance at crab-like pace towards many more ESOPs in our country.

At Pinewood, we have the 007 stage, which is one of the largest film stages in the world; many Bond films have been filmed there.

You would not realise that you were in the middle of my constituency. It is remarkable and a great tribute to the film industry, as are the quality of the technicians and the skills of the people who work at Pinewood and were able to produce such sets. We in this country can compete in the film industry very effectively with the best in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present tax regime is rather special. As I understand it, for films in general expenditure can be written off as revenue is accrued; as the revenue comes in, expenditure can be written off against it, presumably until all expenditure has been written off; after that, the revenue accrues as profit. That seems fine for television, as one receives the revenue fairly quickly after the film has been made, but it may not be so attractive for cinema, as there may be a much longer gap before one receives any revenue.

In 1993, the Government introduced a special regime for what are called "UK films", which are certified by the Department of National Heritage to have been made in this country rather than anywhere else. The object of introducing that new regime was to encourage inward investment, as the people with the big bucks are the American film makers, and we want them to make films here, to bring added wealth to this country and to create jobs. The 1993 regime is best described as "a third, a third, a third": one is allowed a third of the expenditure in each of three years. That is more generous than a traditional capital allowance regime, although not as generous as a regime that allows one to write off expenditure as one incurs it—it is a sort of halfway house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The film market is large—I shall not elaborate on that. The global film industry generates revenues of nearly £30 billion a year from investment of about £6 billion. Some 70 per cent. of films are made in the English language, which is a big plus for us, although only 4 per cent. of film finance is currently invested in production in the UK. The market is growing: in the last year for which figures are available, it grew by 17 per cent. The market is substantial, and we want to attract people to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was recognised early on, the market is good for tourism. Franklin Roosevelt said that if people
	<br><q><p>"watch American movies, they will buy American goods."</p></q>
It is true today that if people watch British movies and see British towns and cities, they may come to this country. I am told that the four-poster bed which featured in "Four Weddings and a Funeral"—it is in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>782</span>
Crown hotel in Amersham, not far from my constituency—is booked until 1997. That is one example of how a film can attract people to a particular location.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are the undertakers similarly booked up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. Making an advance booking for one's funeral is a morbid prospect, and it is more difficult to forecast than when one is likely to take a holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish highlands are enjoying an upsurge in the number of visitors from the United States and Canada, inspired by the recent screenings of "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart". The obvious place to have made "Brave-heart" would have been Scotland—I suspect that most people who have seen the film think that it was made it Scotland—but it was made in Ireland, much to the disappointment of people in Scotland. The film makers were attracted to Ireland because the Irish Government instituted some extremely favourable tax breaks and have succeeded in attracting a substantial amount of film investment and production to the Republic. "Braveheart" is a good example of an investment opportunity lost because of more attractive tax breaks abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make the case for the new clause on a tax basis. If I was not satisfied that it could be justified on that basis, I would not support it, but I believe that it can. The change that was made in 1993 conceded the principle that it is not sufficient just to have a traditional capital allowance regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with the firms of accountants who gave evidence to the Select Committee on National Heritage, saying that what we are discussing is not traditional capital investment at all. Investing in a film is not like investing in plant and machinery, which one would expect to depreciate over 10, 15 or 20 years. Most of the investment is made for the purposes of the film, and will not be of much use to any subsequent productions. It is much more ephemeral and has more in common with revenue expenditure than with capital expenditure, and we should treat it as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The film industry in Britain is enjoying something of a boom. It was not possible for the last Bond film to be made at Pinewood because the stage was busy, and Warner Brothers have recently announced a new investment at Hillingdon—the first film studios to be built in this country for many years. Furthermore, we have a favourable exchange rate with the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those considerations are relevant when people involved with such a mobile investment are thinking about where to invest. I am persuaded that we would attract a great deal more investment if we moved to treating that expenditure as revenue expenditure, and that that would be consistent with basic tax principles. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will give the matter serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause is interesting and I hope that Ministers will examine it carefully. Television production, film-making and video production are increasing and being more widely enjoyed. It is important that the production of film and good quality television programmes should be

promoted as an industry, and not considered merely a sit-back-and-enjoy leisure industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years in Sheffield we were involved in the economic development of a cultural industries quarter. As part of that development we were especially keen to stimulate local and regional production of film and television in Sheffield. Within the United Kingdom industry there is a huge imbalance between production in the London area and in the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We gave incentives to a locally-based organisation, Sheffield Independent Film, which offered equipment, advice and training to small local businesses, to establish a base in Sheffield which now has a small studio and several recording studios, and has just opened three new cinemas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That increase in production in Yorkshire was facilitated by incentives. Equipment is expensive and the outlay cannot be construed as revenue. The construction and development of film studios and associated premises requires capital. The training of the people who work in film production is, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, an investment in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful to establish the principle that accelerated depreciation, as the new clause suggests, might be a way of stimulating UK production at a time when the industry is expanding globally. That would help to redress the imbalance to which the hon. Gentleman referred—the fact that 70 per cent. of the films made worldwide are English language films, but only 4 per cent. of them are produced in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the arguments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. Will the Financial Secretary consider the proposals favourably for the reasons that have already been outlined by the hon. Gentleman? We must bear in mind the potential of the British film industry and how important it is for that developing industry to have a substantial slice of the cake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When debating the matter during last year's discussions on the Finance Bill, I reminded the Committee that the European Commission think tank had considered audio visual policy in 1994. It predicted that the European market for films, television films and audio visual products would grow by 300 per cent. during the next 20 years and that the enormous European market, let alone the world market, had particular advantages for the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was pointed out by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson), a vast number of films are made in the English language. The British film industry already has a 25 per cent. share of the European market. More people are employed in the film industry than are employed in the car industry, and the potential for that to develop is even greater, given the unparalleled talent in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that all members of the Committee are claiming to have a media centre in their constituencies, but Bristol is famous for its animators and for the "Wallace and Gromit" production. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) also closely follows the developments of the company that produces that programme, as well as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>784</span>
being a fan of Wallace and Gromit. We should remember the wonderful success of British talent that has taken a third of the Oscars during the past 20 years and the astonishing success of British animation, which has won the majority of Oscars. That shows how much we can build on the system outlined in the modest new clause. Film production companies are not asking for cash handouts or for massive subsidies, but for a level playing field to enable them to compete internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will say what assistance they will give to the British film industry. It is successful now, but it could be improved. It would provide benefits not only for the Exchequer, but for British industry. It would create more jobs, too. I am talking also about projecting images of our society. Frankly, I would rather my son watched a British-made film that reflected British society than constantly watched American films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I watched a safety course for children that was run by my local authority. When the children were asked what number they would dial for the emergency services, they said "911", which is the American emergency number. They did not know that the number 999 is used in this country. The interlocking factors of jobs, the cohesion and positive images of our society and the opportunity for British talent truly to excel are good reasons why the new clause should be considered sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief because of the hour. I should tell the Committee that I set up a small film and television production company and spent a number of years running it. With that experience behind me, I wish to endorse everything that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said with his customary clarity and coherence. There are extremely good economic arguments and extremely good tax arguments for doing what the hon. Gentleman suggests. We are not talking about supporting a lame duck industry. The arts and culture industry is an industry in which Britain is most capable and most competitive internationally. Britain has an extremely successful music industry internationally. We have an extremely successful television and film industry. Our products are respected and wanted internationally. The Government should therefore be particularly keen to help it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South that it is important to us as British people to see on the cinema screen and the small screen British films, with people talking with British accents that reflect British culture, so that we are not swamped, because of the deregulation of the media, with more American material. We need to defend our own culture. The new clause is intended to achieve that. We must compete in that deregulated industry if we are not to be squeezed out. The new clause would help the British film industry to compete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it was Harold Wilson when he was President of the Board of Trade who introduced the Eadie levy, which gave support to the British film industry for many years. It allowed British productions to go ahead that could not have been made without the levy. They would not have passed the script development stage without it. The levy was sadly abolished several years ago. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>785</span>
Government could, under the new clause, provide support for the industry in place of the levy. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield implied, the Treasury's tax take would go up, because there would be more productions. Certainly, foreign income would come to the United Kingdom, which would be extremely welcome. We would be telling people around the world, through the medium of our films about Britain, British achievements in film making and British culture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government take the needs of film industry seriously, particularly in the light of the Select Committee report and recommendations. I shall try to paint a picture about how I see the current position by reviewing this particular call for help through the tax system put forward by my hon. Friend, and which has been eloquently supported by Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was listening to an industrialist on the radio talking about his business. He made the point that he was in a risk business that had high development costs. He said that success was unpredictable. A certain fashion element was involved, so there was a short product life and he faced high write-off costs if he developed a product that was not very successful. In the industry, there was a high dependency on fads and fashion. It was intensely competitive, and he said that we were good at doing it in the United Kingdom, but we faced world competition. The industry to which I am referring is the toy industry. I saw some parallels between it and the film industry, so I looked for some more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another industry that attracted my attention is tourism, which can be volatile, with the customer base going anywhere in the world according to the various attractions. It is evident that some of the delights of film and spectacular are being intermingled with tourism. Again that industry is dependent on fashion. It, too, has high development costs, sometimes of an equivalent order to those needed for film making. Why do I cite those two industries? The short answer is that within our current tax system both those industries, which display similar characteristics with the film industry, have the same tax regime as everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. Would not it be true to say that all the costs of developing new toys could be written off in the year in which they were incurred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that issue. Subsection (2) of the new clause would provide that the expenditure on United Kingdom qualifying film would all be written off for tax when it is incurred. That seems to contradict what my hon. Friend said in our previous sitting. On Tuesday he said:
	<br><q><p>"I strongly believe in ensuring that taxable profit is as close as possible to recognised profit in a company's accounts."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 5 March 1996; c. 643.]</p></q>
That seems to contradict the position that my hon. Friend is now advocating for the film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. Surely that would bring the industry into line. A film production company writes off the cost of producing a film in the year in which it is incurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I was considering the question of the recognised profit in the company's account book. Clear-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>786</span>
ly, in the film industry, until the film has gone on general release, there cannot be any profit, by definition. There is only expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already provide a very generous tax regime to the film industry and there are a number of ways in which it receives financial help. But does the industry need help? Perhaps I can assist my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield by passing him the relevant paper from which I quoted in case he wants to make a further contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering whether the film industry needs help, we must look at its relative success. I happened to coincide with with Barry Norman's "Film Night" programme in which a Mr. Tony Scott was being interviewed. He has bought Shepperton studios. Mr. Norman asked him about his ambitions for Shepperton and Mr. Scott said:
	<br><q><p>"Our ambitions are to, you know, in the last, I suppose, the last five years I feel there's been a wealth of talent coming out of England in terms of directorial and acting talent, and we want to support that with Shepperton, as well as bringing American money and American movies in here to be done at Shepperton."</p></q>
Mr. Norman then went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"Shepperton has been quite busy of late, hasn't it?"</p></q>
Tony Scott agreed with that and later in the interview he said something that was very telling. In response to Barry Norman's question:
	<br><q><p>"But isn't that largely dependent on the fact that the pound is very weak against the dollar, so if that changes, which it might do, and the pound is strong against the dollar, isn't the … supply of American production going to dry up?",</p></q>
Tony Scott said:
	<br><q><p>"No, because labour costs are cheaper here, a lot cheaper. So, for instance, "Judge Dredd" was 33 per cent. cheaper by shooting it in England than actually shooting it in America. And, you know, what we are trying to do is do a full service production facility, post-production facility as Well as production facility, at Shepperton."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister answer the specific point asked by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about "Braveheart"? I remember watching a television documentary about the production a year or so ago. Because of the fiscal regime, the Republic of Ireland was used as the location rather than the highlands of Scotland, which would have been much more appropriate. Labour costs are broadly the same, but the fiscal regime in the Republic of Ireland made it attractive, as it has done for a number of productions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman on the question of Ireland. While there may have been a fiscal incentive at the time, the Irish Government examined their regime for assisting the film industry and found that it cost their Exchequer in 1994–95 a total of £19.4 million and that benefits totalled no more than £13.5 million. As a result of that report, changes were introduced in the recent Irish Budget to improve the targeting and cost-effectiveness of the Irish Government's help to the film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that does not mean that the Government should do nothing; it means that they should consider the tax regime that they introduce and make it one that is good for the film industry and encourages United Kingdom production but is also good on a tax basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>787</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have told the hon. Gentleman that somebody who is prepared to make a substantial investment in Shepperton Studios said that it was the low production costs, together with the talent of the United Kingdom industry, that were important. At no point in the interview did he mention a need for further inducements in the form of tax breaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give the Committee a long list of the current successes of our film industry—my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield mentioned that fact. Costs are attached to the new clause. As always, we are faced with choices. If the film industry were on its backside and the Government had ignored the Select Committee's recommendations and had not introduced a favourable tax regime for the film industry, the point made by the hon. Member for York would be valid, but the British film industry is doing especially well at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question to which we must return is this: since other fashion-based, talent-based industries do not enjoy such a tax regime, why should we do more for the film industry, which is doing well at present? I am not persuaded that the industry needs the type of help proposed in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Beaconsfield is a reasonable man. I must tell him that our best estimate of the cost of the proposals—it is not a cast-iron estimate—is £15 million in the financial year 1997–98, £15 million in 1998–99 and £5 million in 1999–2000. Obviously, those figures are open to question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that, after that, the proposals would cost nothing, because we are only talking about a cash flow alteration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there would be a decline—as I acknowledged in the figure that I gave for the year 1999–2000. None the less, there is a cost, and we must consider each Budget on a year-by-year basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has given us figures for the cost; did he calculate the possible return from the growth of the industry that would result from the proposed Treasury assistance? Did he consider the trade-off of a short-term loss for a long-term gain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not do that for the reasons that I have mentioned. The film industry in this country is performing very well indeed under the current fiscal regime. Given the evidence that I presented to the Committee from somebody who has made a substantial investment in the United Kingdom, I consider that other questions, such as the cost of making a film, weighted fare more heavily in the minds of film makers and investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary also comment on the problem caused by the separation of production and distribution within the industry? That creates uncertainty for those raising investment for production, because we do not have any large distributors. Did he consider that relationship, and whether assistance could be given at the production stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we follow the hon. Lady's argument,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>788</span>
other industries could make out a substantial case for that sort of assistance if they wanted to do so. The toy industry replicates many of the characteristics that the hon. Lady has just described, but it does not ask for such help. The film industry receives substantial assistance through the various tax regimes that my hon. Friend has described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1989, United Kingdom companies produced or co-produced 30 films, which increased to 89 films in 1994. The Department of National Heritage estimated that the expenditure on United Kingdom qualifying films was approximately £92 million last year. At present, the industry is not struggling to keep the studios full, to look after British technicians or to take advantage of the talents in the United Kingdom. The industry already enjoys substantial tax advantages because of the various way in which expenses can be spread in relation to a film's income. No argument has been advanced to justify further extension of such advantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give some comfort to my hon. Friend who has thought carefully about the matter. Obviously, we shall keep the matter under careful review if it appears that additional assistance is needed in future. I shall not commit myself to that because, as I have said, the best argument for help is that there is a problem. However, films and film making are doing particularly well in this country at present, and it is difficult to justify giving any form of further assistance under the tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know who wrote my hon. Friend's speech, but I think that I could have done better. The cost of developing toys is counted as research and development, so all of it is written off in the year in which it is incurred. The revenue from toys is generated during two or three years, so there is no comparison with film companies. If film companies were placed on the same basis, they could write off expenditure as it was incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend quoted what I said two days ago about trying to align taxable profit and reported profit. I understand that film production companies write off the costs as they are incurred. All I am saying is that the same thing should be allowed for tax purposes, the point that my hon. Friend made was not particularly good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman think that the Financial Secretary made a good point when he told us about the gentleman who invested in studios and who did not answer a question about whether such a tax regime was necessary because Mr. Norman apparently never put it to him? That hardly seemed a strong point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not respond to that intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, this is a matter of judgment, and everyone accepts that the film industry is doing well. The assumption that my hon. Friend made when he talked about costs was that there would be a substantial tax incentive but nothing would change. If I thought that nothing would change, I would not advocate such an incentive. There would be a change; much more investment would be attracted, which would generate revenue. I understand that the Treasury always makes such calculations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>789</span>
on the basis that nothing will change. However, people change their behaviour in response to changes in the tax system. If that were not so, we would not recommend such changes and Conservative Members would not constantly argue for cuts in taxes. We strongly believe in reducing taxes because we believe that people respond to that. I want taxes to be cut for the film industry because people would respond to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman think that it is rather negative to say that the only industries that deserve fiscal incentives are those that are failing? Is not there a case for offering fiscal incentives to industries which have major potential for growth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly agree with the hon. Lady, but I am against giving subsidies to sunset industries. I do not want to make a political point, so I shall not refer to what happened in the 1970s. I agree with the hon.
