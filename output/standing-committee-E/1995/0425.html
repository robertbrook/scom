<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Family Law Bill [Lords] (Except clauses 5 and 7)</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Family Law Bill [<i>Lords</i>] (except Clauses Nos. 5 and 7 and new Clauses or new Schedules as defined in the Order of the House of 25th March) the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays (except Thursday 2nd May) at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are glad to accede to the sittings motion, which seems to be both proper and commodious. I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee, Sir Patrick, when I say how glad we are that, in the course of what is likely to be a rigorous Committee stage on an important Bill, we shall be meeting under your chairmanship and that of your colleague, Mr. O'Hara. There could not be two safer pairs of hands for such a task.<br><br>
Furthermore, given the particular circumstances under which we meet, I wish to acknowledge the presence of your Clerk and the reason he is sitting by your side this morning. On behalf of the Committee, I express condolences at the sad circumstances that have led to the absence of his predecessor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I much appreciate those kind words.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING PARTS II AND III</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first amendment, I wish to inform the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that adequate notice must be given of amendments. As a general rule, I never accept starred amendments—a view that is shared by my co-Chairman. I shall not do so at either morning or afternoon sittings of the Committee. There must be an exceptional reason why a starred amendment is called. That exceptional reason will not be based on the business of any particular hon. Member or on his memory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move. That further consideration be now adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that motion, which is debatable. Obviously, members of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
the Committee must make up their own minds when they have heard the arguments that are advanced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last night, the House had a wide-ranging debate on several amendments to the Bill. During the speeches that were made from both sides of the House, both for and against the amendments, and in the Divisions in the Lobbies, the House expressed a clear view that the Bill must contain provision for the saving of marriages that can be saved and also provision to make the needs and the interests of children paramount. Both sides of the House expressed the view that the Bill should not be simply a vehicle for the dissolution of marriage, but a means by which marriage might be supported. Indeed, as a result of amendments made in another place, the support of marriage as an institution is one of the guiding principles outlined in clause 1.<br><br>
As a result of last night's vote, the time for consideration and reflection required before a divorce may take place is substantially altered. It is quite clear, and the Government conceded the fact yesterday, that a number of consequential amendments will need to be made. They will obviously be more than simple technical amendments.<br><br>
The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but the universal expression of opinion on the Floor of the House yesterday was that reconciliation should be dealt with in the Bill. When speaking to the first group of amendments yesterday, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said in quite unambiguous terms that he readily acceded to that objective. However, the Bill contains only one reference to reconciliation. That reference is not to a mechanism to bring about reconciliation, nor to provisions for its funding; the Bill simply says that reconciliation should be kept in mind by mediators and lawyers. That is all very well, but it is not what the Government pay lipservice to nor is it what the House wants—which is a practical mechanism capable of delivering reconciliation, thereby saving those marriages that can be saved.<br><br>
The Government have tabled no amendments to the Bill. We must therefore assume that they believe it to meet all the requirements and objectives that they have set out here and in another place. It was quite clear last night that the House does not agree with that judgment.<br><br>
Before we consider the amendments tabled by me and my hon. Friends and those tabled by several Conservative Members, we are entitled to know the Goverment's intentions. We are entitled to know the nature of the technical amendments that they will have to make as a result of yesterday's vote. We are entitled to know what other amendments they wish to make and whether they are likely to accept amendments that have already been tabled to strengthen the Bill's support for the institution of marriage and for the protection of the interests of children. That is why my hon. Friends and I support the adjournment of the Committee today. It will give the Government an opportunity, over the weekend and on Monday, to consider their position, to table the amendments that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
they intend to table and, on Tuesday morning, to give the Committee a clear expression of their intentions so that we can continue our deliberations.<br><br>
The importance of that is obvious. For example, the first amendment—No. 36—has been tabled by two Conservative Members. On first sight, that amendment has much to commend it. I fancy that Opposition Members will have no difficulty in supporting it and that it will therefore be carried. Given that, it would be helpful to know, when we come to consider that amendment, whether it is necessary.<br><br>
If, between now and next week, the Minister tabled, or gave a clear commitment that it was his intention to table, a series of detailed amendments that provided for practicable steps to assist in saving marriages, or that set out how, for example, information was to be given to the parties on the implications for the children of the family of any possible divorce, or on the financial implications of a divorce, there would be no need to vote for amendment No. 36.<br><br>
If, however, no such amendments were tabled and no such intention were signalled, there would be every need to ensure that, from the outset, the expressions of principle contained in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) were included in the Bill. That is but one example of the importance of the Government making their intentions absolutely clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are debating the motion that further consideration be adjourned. The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) was impeccable in his choice of argument; he did not stray into debating the merits of the Bill. I shall not permit any discussion on the merits of the Bill. The motion concerns whether the Committee continues to sit this morning or whether it adjourns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the motion moved by the hon. Member for Brent, South. However, I associate myself with his remarks on your chairmanship, Sir Patrick. Given that we have come so early to a debate of this nature, it seems that your qualities will be much needed during the progress of the Committee.<br><br>
The arguments that we have heard are more bogus than most that I have heard in the short time that I have been a Member of Parliament. During the Bill's passage in the other place—and, indeed, before the Bill went to the House of Lords—the Lord Chancellor made it clear that there would be free votes on certain key areas concerning matters of conscience. I recall that, at the back end of last year, accusations were made in some elements of the media that my noble Friend intended to depart from that principle of granting free votes. The matters on which those free votes arose were identified during consideration of the Bill in the other place and when the Bill came to the House. The House dealt with those matters yesterday. Yet again, it was claimed that in some way the proposition that there was a free vote was bogus. I should have thought that an examination of the lists would demonstrate how free the vote was.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
10.45 am<br><br>
Yesterday, in the Committee of the whole House, I mentioned the one area where there has been a change to the formulation of the Bill, namely, that the Lord Chancellor's Department was not proceeding on the basis of any empirical research. I would have drawn that to the Committee's attention had I been able to do so.<br><br>
The length of the period for reflection was a matter of personal judgment. It has been known for a considerable time that there would have to be a Committee of the whole House and that individual Members would have to decide what the proper period for reflection and consideration should be. Therefore, the fact that the Committee of the whole House decided that that period should be 18 months, rather than the 12 months to which the other place agreed, is no reason for this Committee to adjourn. Yesterday's decision does not fundamentally undermine our capacity to reach decisions on amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the need to ensure that provision is made for the saving of saveable marriages. That is one of the cardinal reasons why the Government introduced the Bill. Furthermore, I shall argue—at the appropriate time, rather than now—that many of the Bill's provisions try to achieve thast aim. I am open to suggestions that any hon. Member might make, in amendments and during debates, of ways to eaxmine how that objective may be strengthened.<br><br>
Yesterday's decision by the Committee of the whole House in no way changes the need to consider such amendments. Indeed, were it to do so, I should be somewhat surprised because I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle tabled many amendments relating to supporting marriage guidance services well before yesterday's vote. He has concentrated on the work that this Committee must do, namely, to examine the context of the Bill and ways in which its provisions might be strengthened.<br><br>
At the appropriate time, I hope to have an opportunity to express the Government's view on some of the amendments tabled and to tell the Committee about the technical difficulties with the amendments and how their purpose might be taken on board in due course. The suggestion that yesterday's vote places an imperative on this Committee to consider no business today is not supported by the arguments. For that reason, I resist the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for long because I must attend a meeting of the Select Committee on Unopposed Bills. However, I was saddened by the unnecessarily combative tone of the Minister's speech. We are discussing an important issue of principle and procedure relating to the work of Standing Committees. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that although the Government have tabled no amendments, they intend to do so to give us the benefit of their opinion on some of the issues raised by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
last night's decision. That is not sufficient. The amendments that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has tabled relate specifically to the principle of what steps should be taken to save saveable marriages. The amendment that the Committee of the whole House carried yesterday is directly relevant to that matter.<br><br>
The Committee is in a predicament. How are we to give proper consideration to some of the amendments that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has tabled when we do not know the Government's view of the consequences of the amendment that was carried last night? Despite what the Minister has said, there is no doubt that that amendment is directly relevant to the amendments that the hon. Gentleman has tabled for the Committee to consider today.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South referred to the fact that the amendment carried yesterday will considerably extend the period for consideration and reflection—from 12 months to 18 months. That will require additional changes to be made to the Bill. The logical conclusion is that, given that the ground that we intend to cover today in considering the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is broadly similar to that covered yesterday, when the Committee of the whole House voted to accept the amendment on the period for consideration and reflection, it is incumbent upon us to adjourn the Committee, so that the Government have the opportunity to tell us what they intend to do.<br><br>
It is often said by people outside this House—and to some extent I share this concern—that we tend not to give sufficient consideration in Committee to some of the technical and substantive changes to the law that the Government propose. It has been said to me—I am sure that other members of the Committee have also heard this view expressed—that too often we push on to the statute book legislation that amounts to a licence for lawyers to print money. Time after time, lawyers get three cherries on the fruit machine—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Streeter) may have an opportunity to make comments later.<br><br>
If we consider the amendment carried last night, we must be worried that it will encourage more acrimonious litigation between divorcing partners—especially regarding when the 18-month period begins. There is a belief, which I share, that we should legislate to promote the interests of children and families, not the interests of litigious lawyers. In that context, I hope that the Government will at least reconsider our request for an adjournment so that the Committee can better consider the amendments of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, which concern fundamental issues. The Committee's function is properly to consider amendments and that function is impaired by the Government's response to the amendment carried yesterday. Improved consideration of the amendments would be advanced by an adjournment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The contention of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) that my hon. Friend the Minister is unduly combative is specious. Since I entered Parliament eight years ago, I have served on Committees considering a number of Bills concerning family law. I served on the Committees considering what are now the Children Act 1989, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and various other law reforms—a whole range of non-contentious legislation dealing with children and families. Anybody who has served on such Committees knows that, by and large, they proceed by consensus, which is often established early in the Committee's proceedings. Many points arise that are not in any way party-political and on which there is broad agreement across the Committee.<br><br>
To my regret I saw a report in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> this morning contending that the Government were defeated last night—but everyone knows that they were free votes. I then heard a similar interpretation on Radio 4, although the journalist at the beginning of the report pointed out that they were free votes and that each could vote according to his conscience. Furthermore, it was made clear that the amendments had been tabled for some time. I then heard my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor make a very clear statement that the votes last night in no way challenged the authority of the Bill or undermined the Government's authority—they were the expression of individuals in a free vote, voting by their consciences. To ask for an adjournment on the basis of a puffed up media story that the Government have somehow been defeated and that their Bill has been thrown into disarray is utterly disingenuous. I would expect better from Opposition Members.<br><br>
I wonder whether the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness is deliberately trying to misinterpret the events of last night and the way in which a Committee works. It may be that he has served on so few Committees that he does not realise that the processes in Committee are dynamic. We shall be discussing a series of amendments over a number of days involving briefings and further briefings and amendments and further amendments, which will be tabled day after day.<br><br>
The votes held last night on amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle refer to clauses way on down the track, so there is plenty for us to get our teeth into this morning. It is an important and much needed Bill, which we should spend as much time as possible discussing. There is no reason why we should not get on with debating clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 now. There will be plenty of time later to consider all the points that the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness has raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: During Second Reading on 25 March most hon. Members expressed concern about the complexity of the Bill and the seriousness of its effect. One suggested that if we were not careful it could become the son of the Child Support Agency. The legislation covering that has had to be amended extensively since it was enacted. If we want to have a proper debate and to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
consider fully all the clauses of the Bill, we must allow time to do that. I do not mind how long it takes provided that we can get it right under a proper consensus.<br><br>
We are starting from a bad point. The amendment that was carried last night will have tremendous implications. It is, therefore, important that we have everything that we need before we start making serious decisions. I hope that we can come back on Tuesday with everything before us so that we know exactly where we are. We do not want to make mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be an exaggeration to say that the motion is major opportunism by the hon. Member for Brent, South; it is mild opportunism. The best way to start this part of the Committee stage would be to consider clause 1, which refers to the principles that guide part II relating to divorce and separation. Clause 1(a) states
<br><blockquote><p>"that the institution of marriage is to be supported".</p></blockquote>
How it will be supported is a matter for debate. How one can support the institution of marriage through part II, which gives powers to the court for divorce orders, is a matter that could be argued. It is important to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) that what the House decided yesterday actually confirms what is in the Bill—although it makes a significant change, it does not do major damage to the Government's proposals. The sooner we start doing our job of getting on with the debate, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that if an hon. Member wishes to speak, he or she must stand up. We are not at school. If hon. Members put their hands up I cannot see them. Those wishing to speak must stand, otherwise I shall put the Question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Patrick. I shall learn the ways in which you wish us to proceed.<br><br>
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South. If we legislate in haste on these difficult issues, we will repent at leisure. We all recognise the importance of this series of reforms and we all share the objective of trying to ensure that they are framed to promote marriage and the family as far as possible in the framework of today's society.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South was trying to rewrite history. The Bill has been radically altered by what happened in the House yesterday and the Government's intentions have been changed, Pleas for concensus are welcome—I hope that they will apply later, when we consider Opposition amendments.<br><br>
I looked briefly at the Minister's contribution to last night's debate. He said that
<br><blockquote><p>"we must remember with caution that what we decide tonight will have far-reaching implications."</p></blockquote>
Having regard to that statement, my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South is calling for a short
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
adjournment so that we can give proper consideration to the implications of an amendment that was tabled by Back Benchers, against the Government's intentions. I should have thought that, in that context, the Minister would see the sense of the proposition before us.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of something else that the Minister said last night, referring to one of the implications that we will have to consider. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The longer the period that amendment may bring, the more the argument will gain currency that shortening the period should be granted in particular cases."</p></blockquote>
I agree with that and I believe that there will be a vast increase in litigation resulting from the amendment that was carried last night. It will become another open cheque for lawyers to litigate for those who wish to achieve a divorce more quickly, however sad that might be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there are also resource implications for a mediation process to be funded by the Exchequer, which will now be required to sustain the process over 18 months as opposed to a year? That must have considerable resource implications, which the House and the Committee should examine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and was about to make that point myself. The resource implications resulting from the change last night relate not only to the cost of mediation, but to the costs of legal aid that are likely to fall on the Lord Chancellor's Department from the increase in litigation, as people try to reduce the period before they are granted a divorce.<br><br>
The Minister referred last night to the effect that the longer period would have on children. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The idea that drawing out the period for a lengthier time may be harmful to children is not just my personal view."—(<i>Official Report,</i> 24 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 531–3.)</p></blockquote>
I take it from that that he believes that a longer period has implications for the welfare of children. One thinks, for example, of cases where domestic violence may be involved, which I hope we will debate later, and the possible implications of that not just on the spouse, but on the welfare of children and the guilt that they might feel.<br><br>
If there are such implications, we may have to table amendments to ensure—as I hope the entire Committee agrees—that the welfare of children is paramount in our consideration of the Bill. We have raised two or three issues that the Minister raised last night and which are pertinent to the motion proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South that we should defer proceedings today so that we can give proper consideration to appropriate amendments next week. I hope that the Committee will take a consensual view and realise the common sense of that proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a mood to dispel the image of being combative—I agree with the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness that that would be an unhelpful start to the Committee's proceedings,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
although I do not altogether accept the charge—I am grateful to the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) for quoting so much from my speech last night. I cannot possibly disagree with anything that I said, but I remind the Committee that I was speaking from the Dispatch Box in a personal capacity. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness may not have been there to hear me say that, but I emphasised it—quoting the words of the hon. Member for Brent, South, who said that anything that he said from the Dispatch Box should be interpreted not as Labour party policy but as his personal view. I believe that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), who was present for most of the debate, recalls those observations.<br><br>
The point that has been made is that our deliberations are affected by the vote in favour of the amendment to lengthen the period before an application for a divorce order can be made. However, before the period can be abridged, the application for divorce has to be made, and before the application for divorce can be made, finance and property matters have to be resolved. Therefore, an application to the court for the divorce order is not affected by that amendment—there are no resource implications.<br><br>
It is necessary that we should have mechanisms to sustain mediation and to ensure that mediation can be made available. However, it is stretching the point to suggest that a lengthier minimum period adds substantially to the costs of mediation. Those who understand how mediation works will recognise that the mediator is involved in helping the parties to come to agreements on finance and property. Many Conservative Members have claimed that that is one of the negatives about mediation; they say that it is not sufficiently channelled towards reconciliation. In fact, figures show that 10 per cent, of people who engage in the mediation process decide to become reconciled, which is one of the positives. The process of mediation does not become more expensive because the minimum period has been lengthened from 12 to 18 months. Since the Bill was amended in the other place, it has provided for a period that could be extended to up to two years, if need be, so I do not believe that there are substantial resource implications.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South has greater experience of this place than I have, but, even with my limited experience, I recognise that Committee proceedings are a dynamic process, in which a range of amendments are tabled throughout the Committee's deliberations. It is unrealistic to say that every Government amendment must be available to the Committee at the Committee's first sitting. That is an extraordinary proposition, which has not been adhered to in any previous Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the Opposition's finest amendments have yet to be thought of and I do not suppose that they want, at this stage, to put all the amendments that they might frame on to the Table.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent point. As the debate unfolds, Conservative and Opposition Members will wish to propose new amendments for consideration. You, Sir Patrick, have infinitely more experience than any of us in the way in which that operates.<br><br>
I have not heard anything this morning that shows that the Committee should be precluded from considering the early amendments and I urge the Committee to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take in good part the censure—and censure it was—proffered by the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) of my mild opportunism. I have been accused of many things, but never of "mild" opportunism. I am less sanguine, however, about the remarks of the hon. Member for Stockton, South and take exception to them. He attempted to patronise my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness. He also trotted out his own curriculum vitae. Having been on Committees with him before, I have already heard it. He then went on to tell us how he had choked over his cornflakes when reading <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> this morning. Surely that is a common occurence for Conservative Members and happens when they read not only <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> but <i>The Times,</i> the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Daily Express.</i> The hon. Gentleman's remarks were a bit much.<br><br>
The Minister said that the House had known for a long time what was on the Table yesterday for consideration by the Committee of the whole House. That is true. However, not only had hon. Members known about those amendments for a long time but the Lord Chancellor's Department had too, so I presume that amendments are ready and waiting to be tabled as a consequence of the amendment being accepted last night. We are entitled to ask when we shall see them and what they contain. I hope that they—or at least, the technical ones—will be available on Monday morning. If so, all well and good, and we postpone our debates until Tuesday.<br><br>
The Minister's general attitude was replicated in a rather unusual form by the hon. Member for Stockton, South who said of Opposition amendments that the best was yet to come. That was very kind of him, but nothing has come from the Lord Chancellor's Department. A great deal was promised, and not only in the other place. Indeed, much has been promised since then. I recollect attending a seminar with the Minister which was trumpeted with great aplomb by him, the Lord Chancellor and the public relations section of the Lord Chancellor's Department—a much over-stretched resource at present. It was said that it would be an opportunity for the organisations conceerned with providing assistance in such matters to have their say. As a result of that and the operation of the interdepartmental governmental committee, the seminar would have produced something positive and the Lord Chancellor would have to think again.<br><br>
So far, we have seen absolutely nothing. The Lord Chancellor was kind enough to refer to the Second Reading debate and our proposal for a Lord Chancellor's advisory committee on marriage and the family. Our objective was to make the family and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
marriage the fundamental building block of our society. The Lord Chancellor said that he was considering that. As a result, we held back from tabling amendments. Perhaps we were naive—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Yes", but we took the Lord Chancellor at his word. We did not table amendments about an advisory committee because we were waiting to see what the Lord Chancellor would do after he had reflected on the matter.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I do not want to engender acrimony, but I and my hon. Friends have noticed—I fancy that Conservative Members have, too—that the Lord Chancellor's tactics are analogous to those of a tortoise under attack. When a crow, vulture, cat or other predator comes near it, the tortoise pulls in its head. There is then no action, so the predator loses interest—perhaps only momentarily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is possible, I suppose, that the predator might go to a Select Committee down the Corridor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is always possible.<br><br>
The tortoise would then put its head out again and move forward. In fact, it will have conceded nothing; it would still continue along the same track. Those who have followed the progress of the Bill have noticed that that is how the Lord Chancellor's Department operates.<br><br>
We have news for the tortoise. We are not prepared to see such behaviour continue. Hon. Members on all sides have deeply held views about the Bill's failings. Unless we see some positive response from the Lord Chancellor's Department—the Minister will have to amend the Bill in Committee—the tortoise will be upended. There is no other way. That is what lay behind the comments made from the Dispatch Box last night. I assure the Minister of one thing, lest he slip into error—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Really?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, slip further into error. The hon. Member for Stockton, South ought to be more careful with his interventions, because they encourage me to go further.<br><br>
I do not want the Minister to slip further into error by believing that the general comments made about the Bill from the Dispatch Box last night were simply my personal opinion. They were not: the Opposition's general concerns about the Bill are, for us, matters of principle. They will not go away during the Committee stage or on Report. More important, they will not go away on Third Reading. I urge members of the Committee to vote in such a way as to encourage reflection and consideration not only by those considering divorce but by the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 36. As this is a fairly wide-ranging amendment, I propose to use the Chairman's discretion to allow wide-ranging debate, and we will not then have a clause stand part debate. This is a fairly common procedure that helps the Committee as it avoids my having to pull up members of the Committee if they stray a little. So we shall have a wide-ranging debate of this amendment; of course, we shall also debate amendment No. 30. The Committee can vote on either or both of the amendments as it wishes, and then we shall vote on clause stand part without a substantive debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page l, leave out line 12 and insert—

<br><blockquote><p> (iii) made aware of the financial implications of a possible divorce for the parties.".</p></blockquote>
Like my colleagues, I welcome you to the Chair, Sir Patrick. As you said, this is an opportunity to have a somewhat more wide-ranging debate than we may be able to have later in our deliberations. I know that I had to delay the House for a considerable period yesterday—thanks to more than 20 interventions on my speech—so I do not want to speak for too long today. Many of the points that I would want to make I and other hon. Members made yesterday. However, I wanted to emphasise at the beginning of our consideration that the Bill is too important to be the subject of party politics. I certainly do not want to wreck the Bill; it has received a Second Reading. I want to improve the Bill, not to filibuster. The Bill addresses a complex matter. Indeed, more than 300 amendments were tabled to the Bill in the other place. I am not sure how many amendments will need to be tabled during our deliberations, but I suspect that it will be a considerable number. I myself will be tabling more amendments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Yesterday's debate was very interesting, and I was struck by what the hon. Member for Brent, South said. The House has now decided that, in future there shall be no-fault divorce, but we cannot have value-free divorce or, indeed, value-free marriage. I think that that is what the hon. Member for Brent, South said in his speech, which was excellent.<br><br>
If we have decided to have no-fault divorce, it is all the more important that we have extra safeguards in the Bill. As we well know, and as we read in our newspapers today, the Government lost the vote last night on the time extension. I welcome that, not because I particularly enjoy inflicting defeat on the Government—as has been said, it was a genuine free vote anyway—but because I think it vital that we should provide in the Bill both time and resources for reconciliation. I believe there to be cross-party support for that point of view, which is one that the hon. Member for Brent, South has expressed many times, and on which I fully agree with him.<br><br>
The themes of this amendment will run throughout our debates on amendments that I have tabled. They are the themes of protecting children, to ensure that their interests are fully taken into account and of ensuring justice and fairness to protect the innocent spouse or the one who wants the marriage to continue. There should be more justice and fairness when considering conduct in deciding the future of the children of the marriage or the assets. Most important, we must consider the theme of promoting reconciliation. I want to shift the whole debate and the emphasis of the Bill towards saving marriages. I think that we really all agree with that. We are debating legislation that may be the law for the next 20 or 30 years, so what is the harm in including in the Bill what I think we all support?<br><br>
Worthy as the Bill is, there is a stark contrast between the hands-on approach that we see with regard to mediation—often detailed clearly in the Bill—and the hands-off approach with regard to reconciliation. Subsection (c) refers to the marriage ending and subsection (b) refers to the marriage being in difficulty, but they say nothing about people who are in difficulty being encouraged to save the marriage.<br><br>
That leads me to a major point. There should be active intervention by the state to help both parties in a marriage. The philosophy of the Bill is that parties will spontaneously reconcile themselves and that it is either impossible for the state to help them or that it has insufficient resources to do so. I know that there is a sensible point of view that neither the state nor any individual can force people to go to marriage guidance, but there is no harm in using the Bill as a vehicle to give people an opportunity to do so. Every encouragement and resource should be given to make that happen.<br><br>
We must ensure that the emphasis of the Bill is changed. I see large sums of money and block grants going to large, worthy organisations such as Relate for the purpose of mediation—there is no harm in that—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
but we should shift the emphasis towards the grass roots, namely marriage guidance. That is what my amendments seek to do and that is what I am hinting at in my preamble.<br><br>
I share with the hon. Member for Brent, South the desire for a litigation-free period, which is not provided by the Bill at present. Before the legal process starts, people should be encouraged down the marriage guidance route. My amendment No. 36 and amendment No. 6, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Brent, South, make that clear. The state is promoting mediation so why cannot the same be done for reconciliation? My hon. Friend the Minister may deny it and although, I appreciate that he is doing his best in difficult circumstances, I believe that there is a lack of an even-handed approach. I do not know the truth about the figures but if what the Library tells me is true, they are alarming. We spend £5 billion on the consequences of the break-up of marriages, but we are prepared to spend only £3 million saving marriages.<br><br>
We all want to encourage reconciliation. We heard a lot about Auntie Wu yesterday, but the local church, relatives or whoever could be involved. The hon. Member for Brent, South made a telling point earlier. He said that we should make the Bill a buttress of marriage, not just a vehicle for its dissolution.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
If my amendment were accepted, we would encourage people to face up to the consequences of divorce for not only themselves but their children. They would have to face the realities of financing two households, not one. It might be said that such an amendment is not needed because reconciliation is mentioned already. The hon. Member for Brent, South has told us that reconciliation is mentioned only once in the Bill and that it must be kept in the minds of lawyers. However, lawyers have shown precious little inclination to take part in reconciliation during the past 40 or 50 years. There has been no financial incentive for them to do so.<br><br>
We must create a consensus in the Committee so that the Bill clearly states that the same resources should be given to reconciliation and marriage guidance as are given to mediation. That might well involve a cost. I am the last person to want to inflict further costs on the Government. Undoubtedly, the Treasury would look askance at what I am saying. However, if we could spend a little more money now on helping to save marriage, we would save much more later given the huge cost to the state of marriage breakdown.<br><br>
Another objection to the amendment might be that it is just motherhood and apple pie. It might be said that my amendment is quite sensible, but that it adds nothing to the Bill. Of course, it could be said that as we all agree that people should be
<br><blockquote><p>"encouraged to take all practicable steps to save the marriage, through marriage counselling or otherwise; made aware of the implications of a possible divorce for any children of the family; and made aware of the financial implications of a possible divorce for the parties".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
why should such a provision be put into the Bill? If that were true, why have the rest of the preamble? Is not it also motherhood and apple pie, as it states
<br><blockquote><p>"that the institution of marriage is to be supported; that the parties to a marriage which may have broken down are to be encouraged to take all practicable steps to save it;"</p></blockquote>
and so on? The amendment is important, and it adds to the Bill.<br><br>
It was either Lord Stoddart of Swindon or Lord Stallard—I know that there is a difference and I apologise to them—who ensured that the preamble was inserted into the Bill. So there is cross-party support for ensuring that we set out what we believe in right from the beginning. I hope that the Committee will accept my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In essence, I support the amendment. It would make good sense to state that people should be
<br><blockquote><p>"encouraged to take all practicable steps to save the marriage; through marriage counselling or otherwise."</p></blockquote>
However, we should not delude ourselves that marriage counselling or guidance would be necessarily best served by Auntie Wu—that mythical lady referred to in yesterday's Committee of the whole House—or by intimate family members or neighbours.<br><br>
In areas of such sensitivity, where emotions run very high and can be exacerbated by the smallest wrong word, properly trained and resourced marriage counsellors are essential. Such counsellors are vital in achieving the aim of the amendment, as are the surroundings in which counselling takes place. As the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said, we are considering a situation in which the costs of marriage breakdown to the country are running at £5 billion or more, but the resources that the nation has deemed fit to allocate to preventing that are as small as £3 million.<br><br>
During the Committee of the whole House last night, there were many references to the institution of marriage. If we are concerned that it is to be enhanced and given value, proper resources must be in place to assist when marriages become rather shaky or when those most intimately involved believe that they have no possible, positive future together.<br><br>
Sizeable resources are needed. I am sure that there is no one in the Committee or the House who would not concur with the statement that the interests of the children involved must be paramount. The resources must therefore be examined in a much wider context than the immediate counselling of the parents. Such counselling is exceedingly important, but it must be carried out by properly trained counsellors. It cannot be conducted on an ad hoc basis—a convenient piece of advice offered over a cup of tea, although I know that a cup of tea is often useful in defusing emotional situations.<br><br>
I support the amendment, and trust that the Committee will see fit to incorporate it into the Bill, but we should not delude ourselves that words and good intentions are enough. During the debates on the Bill, which impact on an area of great personal intensity and sensitivity, we must be extremely careful
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
not to promise what we are unable or unwilling to deliver.<br><br>
There is a need for serious resourcing of the services that the amendment would necessarily bring in train, so we should consider it carefully. The damage caused by marriage breakdown is enormous, although I do not believe that the children of divorced parents automatically end up as drug addicts or in criminal courts, or that, because of their parents' inability to live together in a positive and productive way, they are automatically anti-social or a burden on our society.<br><br>
There are undoubtedly thousands of families living way below what we would regard as an acceptable economic level. A report from my local authority, Camden, on domestic violence quotes national figures of 14,000 women and 21,000 children in shelters, escaping from domestic violence. The possibility of mending those marriages is clearly remote. We must reconstitute public opinion—which is made up of individual members of the public, not some vast, amorphous group—to appreciate that the institution of marriage is of value and that it can be one of the best ways of raising children. If we are serious about attempting to prevent breakdown in marriages where reconciliation is possible, we should understand that the resources that society must invest in the process cannot be small. Those offering advice must be trained to the highest possible standards. Before I finish, I must repeat what I said earlier—that we must not offer false hope through the amendment. We are making presumptions about proper law in a sensitive, intimate and important area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: People in general do three things—what they are good at, what they enjoy and what they feel is worth while. I have received advice from a man in his 80s who, for the past six years, has looked after his bedridden wife. On their mantelpiece are two trophies for a mixed tennis tournament, which they won together 60 years ago. They have been married for nearly 60 years. That man looks after his wife not because it is fun but because it is worth while. There are many things in marriage—as in life and politics—that are not easy. Doing the right thing may not elicit a round of applause or extra money in the bank, but is often worth while. Our debates in Committee will be like that.<br><br>
I wish to pay public tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, echoing what I said to him privately last night. He deserves great praise for the work that he has done; he has been a link to many people who care deeply about Parliament's contribution to making life less awful for separated people who may be seeking divorce. He has helped Parliament to discharge its duties to those who may become victims such as children, families and married people who may believe that divorce is a partial answer to their problems. He deserves that tribute.<br><br>
In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton. South, I was shocked by the media coverage of last night's events. I was close to the Prime Minister when the result of the third vote was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
announced and he was not shocked by the outcome. I also spent some time with my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle afterwards and he was neither exultant nor jubilant. Events were simply part of the process of allowing the House and the Committee to do their duty in framing legislation.<br><br>
After that ground clearing, I come to the amendment. The spirit behind it is right. I shall not support it but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider new provisions on Report: to include some of the examples that are listed in clause 1 (c), which establishes a principle for parts II and III of the Bill. If a marriage is formally to be brought to an end, it should be done
<br><blockquote><p>"with minimum distress to the parties and to the children affected;… with questions dealt with in a manner designed to promote as good a continuing relationship between the parties and any children affected as is possible in the circumstances; and … without costs being unreasonably incurred in connection with the procedures to be followed in bringing the marriage to an end."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would include those elements so that people who may be thinking of applying for a divorce have a clearer picture of what it will entail. It refers to the central value of counselling. It also refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the implications of a possible divorce for any children"</p></blockquote>
and to
<br><blockquote><p>"the financial implications of a possible divorce".</p></blockquote>
Could not my hon. Friend the Minister consult his advisers and find a way of including those important elements in clause 1(b)? We all accept the clause's current wording:
<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard to the following general principles"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"that the institution of marriage is to be supported".</p></blockquote>
However, subsection (b)—
<br><blockquote><p>"that the parties to a marriage which may have broken down are to be encouraged to take all practical steps to save it"—</p></blockquote>
could be expanded to include as a matter of principle the effect of a divorce first on children and secondly on finances. A third element is that people do not have to face such problems by themselves. Counselling—which should offer conciliation and the opportunity for reconciliation—should be made available for those who want it.<br><br>
Clause 1 may not represent a very English or British way of legislation, but it establishes the principles governing the active parts of the Bill. That is useful, as it allows this Committee, without taking evidence, in effect to follow the procedure that operates in Special Standing Committees and to cause hon. Members to consider what they are trying to achieve. Too often, we are asked to legislate without having that clearly in mind.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
As I suggested on the Floor of the House last night, I believe that the Bill will not do a great deal for marriage. However, the publicity that it arouses may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
cause people to think about why they are getting married. That seems a worthwhile thought to place in people's minds. People cannot be put through the sort of theory test that is being introduced in a month or two for drivers. Multiple-choice questions on the right course of action in various circumstances may be desirable but it would be wrong to require such a test by law.<br><br>
It is possible that another Bill will require people to give greater notice of marriage. If we are saying that people will not be able to apply for divorce within a year of marriage, why should we allow people to get married at a few days' or weeks' notice. Perhaps we should require people to take time for reflection before they go through a civil or religious ceremony of marriage. That is not a provision in the Bill, but it is a principle that is worth considering as we examine clause 1.<br><br>
In the early 1980s, I formed an organisation called Family Forum, which brought together many of the voluntary associations concerned with the family. One of our preparatory meetings brought together the different Government Departments concerned with marriage and divorce, which seldom met. That distance was similar to that apparent in connection with the under-fives, who came under the aegis of what were then the Departments of Education and of Health and Social Security. People joked that those Departments got together for the first time only when a hotel receptionist booked Lady Young and Sir George Young—the relevant Ministers at the time—into the same room.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle rightly brought to the Committee's attention the peculiar contrast between the cost to the public purse of the divorce process and the amount of money that is formally available for supporting advice and counselling. In practice, the money for advice and counselling does not have the greatest impact on the numbers of people applying for divorce and thus incurring financial consequences for the state and for themselves. But even if that money does represent only a minor part in the equation, the amount of money devoted to advice and counselling shows up one of the problems of our public expenditure planning process.<br><br>
That process involves a Department going to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and saying that it wants to make a certain amount of money available to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, to Relate, to the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and to other relevant organisations. The bodies that exist could do much more if more resources were made available. Many do not pay their counsellors, some do, but not at commercial rates.<br><br>
The other side of the coin involves the financial consequences of divorce, or the costs incurred by people before and after divorce. They add up to great demands on the social security budget and on the Court Service, although I am not sure how that system works. The provision of resources to organisations offering advice and counselling is limited because it is possible to limit it; the money spent on the demands
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
on the social security budget and so on is unlimited because such demands cannot be limited.<br><br>
The result is the fantastic difference—or ghastly ratio—between trying to help and dealing with the consequences. I hope that the Government will be able to say what more will be done to ensure that counselling becomes more demand-led. People who seek advice want someone to listen to them and they ought to be able to get at least a preliminary interview and a ground-clearing discussion at once. It is difficult for people to admit that they have a problem that needs to be shared. We ought to make it possible for those with the courage and sense to make such an admission to begin the process at once, without having to wait for a week or a month on a waiting list.<br><br>
The same is true for people who have difficulties with their children. They find it hard to get help from child guidance units, at least on a preliminary basis.<br><br>
The same is true for people who have difficulties with their children. They find it hard to get help from child guidance units, at least on a preliminary basis. That is often one of the signals—like going to visit one's general practitioner—that something is wrong in a relationship. Early attempts to get people to face what might be wrong in their relationships can help to avoid their getting on to the helter-skelter that leads to disaster and to irreparable breakdown.<br><br>
My final point on clause 1 is about family-friendly policies. If we were to ask what the rate of inflation is, most Committee members could give the answer to one point in 100. Were we to ask about the rate of unemployment, most could do that to within about 10 per cent. Were we to ask people outside the Committee, other than specialists, what has happened to trends in divorce, most people would say that they have been going up and up. In practice, divorce rates went up for two decades, were stable for a decade and are now almost certain to decline for a decade, whatever provisions we put in the Bill. There is general ignorance about what age or stage people start to apply for divorce—about the circumstances of marriages. People do not know what type of environment tends to work and what type tends not to work. We know which factors affect inflation or unemployment, although we dispute some of the precise reasons and the balance between them, but there is very little discussion about effective family function.<br><br>
We should have a social model of the economy similar to the financial models which the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray) helped to get the Treasury to share with Parliament and the outside world. We ought to have cohort studies which are started and returned to every seven years so that we become as interested in social change as we are in tax, financial or economic change. Were our discussion today about economic advance during the past 25 or 100 years, we would have plenty of things to talk about. Were it about medical change during the past 25 or 100 years, we would have plenty of things to talk about. But were we to discuss social advance during the past 25 or 100 years, we would not have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
much to talk about. Every week, 2,000 people still commit their first serious criminal offence. Five thousand people a week still take up smoking. Six thousand people a week still contribute to conceptions that end in abortions. None of those things are desirable in any way, but how long would it take to detect a change in the figures? How long would it take to find a change in the age-specific incidence of criminal offending, or in the age-specific involvement in conceptions that end in abortions? How long would it take us to realise a change in the distribution pattern and the incidence of divorces?<br><br>
My guess is that with a little more effort outside the Bill—in addition to our considerations—it ought to be possible to ask the Government to set out explicit family policy targets every three to five years, which would only be achieved if families started to do more things themselves to give them more confidence and competence. We have plenty of involvement in enterprise and in social protection as defined by the social partnership, but we tend not to have specific interests in family policies.<br><br>
I am reminded by Opposition Members about the impact of the development of the family centre movement. I have probably got the facts slightly wrong, but if a half-trained social worker is put into a flat or an estate, perhaps outside Nottingham, the number of children taken into care can fall by about three quarters within a couple of years. That is not just because the magistrates have greater confidence or because parents can come together around a clothes-washing machine or a kettle, but because people experience the type of uplift more commonly discussed in places such as South Africa—a country which people realise is underdeveloped.<br><br>
We in Britain should realise that we are undeveloped and accept that if our rate of divorce and the proportion of children who are affected by their parents' divorce are so great, we must start to examine some of the underlying and associated causes, instead of simply relying on changes to this or other clauses in the Bill. Having said that, the point put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is correct and I hope that Ministers will be able to find some way of incorporating it in the clause and at later stages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the principle embodied in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. In common with several of my hon. Friends, I was surprised by the Bill's lack of emphasis on reconciliation. It does not allow or require couples contemplating divorce to consider its likely implications not only for them and their children, but for their children's education, for where they will live and for members of their wider family—all issues that people often fail to consider. Contemplating divorce is like dropping a stone in a pond—the ripples spread far wider than one might appreciate.<br><br>
I wholly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) that marriage counselling is not necessarily done by a friend or relative over a cup of tea at the kitchen table—it is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
skill. People in organisations all over the country often offer counselling out of the goodness of their hearts because they are not paid much, if anything, to do so. None the less, counselling requires training if it is to benefit those who are considering divorce.<br><br>
I want to place on record the comments of Relate, an organisation that I greatly respect and which specialises in counselling people whose marriages are going through a difficult period or who are contemplating divorce. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unless counselling is included as a central component in divorce law reform, couples are unlikely to reflect on the enormity of the decision to end a marrige. The opportunity to save some marriages will be lost, and couples will be forced to make arrangements for the future without dealing with the unresolved issues from the past. It is this failure to deal with the past that is so often responsible for ongoing conflict. This may lead to an increased risk of failure in subsequent relationships".</p></blockquote>
Those words must be set against the fact that Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe—41 per cent. of today's marriages are likely to end in divorce. Research done at the university of Bristol, by Gwyn Davis and Mervyn Murch—both of whom I have known for many years—showed that 51 per cent, of divorced men and 29 per cent. of divorced women not only regretted getting divorced but regretted divorcing the particular person they had divorced. The regret is, therefore, two-pronged and it would be irresponsible not to provide such people with an opportunity to open the window and discover some of the consequences of divorce.<br><br>
It would also be negligent not to provide people with an understanding of the pressure points in marriage that can trigger divorce and which are well known to those who work in marriage counselling. Any major change in a marriage can lead to difficulties that can, if unresolved, result in divorce. Paradoxically, one such change is the birth of the first child. One might assume that a couple would be bathed in a radiant glow because they had produced a child of whom they were fond and whom they wanted to nurture. That extra person's appearance in a relationship can, however, cause conflict between the parties. They might not know how to resolve that conflict because they think that they are supposed to feel happy at the birth of their child. Instead, they feel guilty about their unresolved feelings. Sometimes a father might feel a little resentful of the little new person who manipulates his wife's life. At the same time, a woman might feel very angry with a man who wants to go on pretending that their relationship is still the same and that the apearance of the child makes no difference.<br><br>
The other pressure points are when children start school, when they reach 11 or when they are in their early teens. When my children were in their teens I was sustained by Mark Twain. I shall paraphrase what he said: "When I was 16, I thought my father was a fool. When I was 21, I was amazed at how much the old boy had learnt in five years." Any parent with children of that age knows that that is the reality of bringing up teenage children. That can cause terrible friction between the parents. Anyone who denies the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
truth of that either does not spend much time at home or is blind to the realities.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's contribution is interesting. She is sharing with the Committee a view that I have always held about the pressure that the arrival of the first child puts on relationships. She will know from her experience that many health visitors are considering whether they should be engaged in relationship issues rather than solely developmental issues. Given the hon. Lady's experience with Relate, will she tell the Committee whether it believes that marriage support works better when the parties are prepared voluntarily to participate, and that if it is made compulsory, the parties are likely to be more negative?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it would be self-defeating to require people to do something without explaining the benefit that they could gain from it. It is a question of approach: if people are told that they can have a divorce, but, before being given a divorce, they have to go through a ludicrous and boring process for a specified or unspecified period to try to make things better, of course they will be negative. If the objective is right and proper, it is surely not beyond our ability to take a positive approach and to explain to people that they have an opportunity to consider the wider implications of the decisions that they are about to take.<br><br>
The amendment is not merely about the rights of parents; it is also about how we hear the voices of the children. That is one of the most difficult things to achieve. I regret to say that I went through a divorce when my children were not particularly young but had not left home. I have seen my friends go through that process and I have worked as a lawyer specialising in this field. It is difficult to establish what the children want, because they are often used in the bartering process. That is one of the most damaging things of all, because if children are asked what they want, they often say that they want their parents to stay together, but that they want their parents to be happy and to get on—they do not want any arguments. We know that those objectives are often utterly irreconcilable. If couples decide to divorce, we do not want their children to have to choose which parent they want to be with, to the obvious detriment of the other parent.<br><br>
I have represented people in court on an ancillary relief application, which deals with the financial consequences of divorce. Often, my clients were women and they would tell me that they did not want the children to have much to do with their father. I would get out my pen and say, "Let me write this down. You are instructing me that your children should not see their dad. Is that it?" When it was put as badly as that, they would often get angry with me and say, "I thought you were supposed to be on my side." I would say, "Yes. I am representing you. but I have to be clear about your instructions. Are you instructing me that these children should not see their dad? I understand why you are angry with him and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
that you do not want to live with him, and I can understand that you think he is a monster, but he is their dad. Are you saying that the door must be shut on them?" Putting it in that way would often make them back off from giving that instruction and perhaps they would then acknowledge that it would be right and proper for the door to remain open to the father. All the evidence shows that about five years after divorce, 50 per cent. of dads have lost contact with their children. That is a tragedy.<br><br>
We must find ways of taking that adversarial approach out of family law. I often came back from court and my colleagues in chambers asked me what I had been doing. When I told them, they would ask whether I had won. After a while, however, they stopped asking me that because it used to make me so angry. I would ask them to tell me who won in a family divorce case. The person who gets an application for contact with children has not won, because the child has two parents. We have to ensure that there is such contact and that people who are trained in that area of law do not treat it like the battles that we see daily on the news; they are fought over libel, contract or negligence, where there are winners and losers.<br><br>
We must consider other issues, such as access to grandparents. That exercises my mind much more now that I have two small grandsons of my own. [Hon. Members: "That is not possible!"] I suppose I should be flattered that some members of the Committee consider that impossible, but I do not want to suggest that I was a child bride. I have looked at my grandsons and thought of the number of people in my position who do not get to see their grandchildren. I am having to come to terms with how painful that must be, and how damaging it must be for the children. We all know that as children get older, they often find it impossible to talk to their parents, but they can talk to their grandparents. I remember that happening with me. The children in my family often talked-to our Irish gran. We thought she had a lot of wisdom and sense and we could confide things in her that we could not say to our parents. Hon. Members should not shut that door for children.<br><br>
When we are encouraging people to consider the financial implications of divorce, which is the third limb of the amendment, although we ought to say that the effect of a divorce will mean that a parent will have to support two homes rather than one—most people find that difficult, if not impossible—and that the effects on children will be those of a very low income and of parents working long hours to support them, we should not stigmatise such children and assume that they will all turn into drug-taking criminals with low educational attainment. I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate on that. Such results are not necessarily the outcome. I know that in cases where the parents divorce in as amicable and reasonable a frame of mind as possible, and where children are not forced to choose and are nurtured by both parents, it is possible for those children to achieve whatever they want to achieve.<br><br>
I think of my own son and daughter and I remember
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
my son saying to me not long ago that he had never felt that he could not say something nice about his dad to me and something nice about me to his dad. because it had never caused any conflict. His dad and I had agreed right at the beginning that we would never use the fact of our divorce to give the children an opportunity to play us off against each other, as does a child who asks his mother to buy him such a thing "because Dad won't". We know that children are not stupid; they quickly pick up on the opportunities for them when their parents do not agree.<br><br>
From an early age, my daughter wanted to be a doctor and indeed, she is now a general practitioner in a practice that is not far from the House. My son wanted to be a teacher and he is now a teacher. They are children of divorced parents. It is therefore wrong and unfair to say that all children of divorced parents will be emotional cripples, drop-outs and criminals. There are other structural courses and effects, some of which have been introduced by the Government, which contribute to that. On the question of family impact, I could not agree more with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Eltham. I gather that he does not want to spend much more time with his current constituents and is going to represent a constituency somewhere in Sussex.<br><br>
Family impact is very important. I am one of the officers of the all-party parliamentary group on parenting. We held public meetings in the summer of 1994 over a period of a month in the Grand Committee Room, hearing evidence from many individuals and organisations. Issues arising included a requirement for parenting education and information and the need for a family friendly world. In my estimation, the British do not like children very much. My daughter was born in Africa and we came back to this country when she was two years old. I was utterly appalled at the disparity of treatment that she and I, as her mother, got after what was accorded to us in Africa. The House would be doing a service if when considering legislation, rather than confining ourselves to environmental impact, we assessed family impact.<br><br>
I was talking to someone earlier this week about public transport and the fact that in France, it is possible to take children into a family carriage on a train where there is provision for children. I was astonished to find a business woman, with whom I was discussing the matter, saying that she thought that there were proposals to ask people to pay a supplement so that they would not have to share a carriage with children. Suggesting that children are impediments and encumbrances and that people should be able to pay to get away from them is a typical British response, rather than suggesting that it should be possible for us to have a public transport system that enables parents to read the tale of Mrs. Tiggywinkle out loud without causing embarrassment or annoyance. If we really do want a family-friendly world, we should be saying that the family impact of legislation is important.<br><br>
It is no good leaving families to hang free and telling them to get on with it, saying. "You bring up the children and if it goes wrong, you are to blame for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
turning them into crime-ridden drug addicts." Our children are a precious resource. They are great company and we can learn a lot from them. They often have a new and fresh eye on the world. How many of us have now considered animal welfare because children have written to us? People bringing up children deserve not just our support but structures that will enable them to carry out their job more easily than they can do now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill, as I understand it, is about divorce and separation, and provides funds for dealing with matters connected with mediation in disputes. It has been introduced by my noble Friend, the Lord Chancellor who is responsible for such matters. It is not a Bill about marriages, how to save them or how to warn people of the pitfalls before they take the plunge. That responsibility belongs to the Home Office. Therefore, I cannot see how funds can be provided by the Bill for dealing with marriage saving when it is not a resource that my noble Friend has available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to continue because I shall not take very long.<br><br>
The sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle are sincere—I do not doubt that for one moment—but he is simply wrong in trying to include his amendments in the Bill. They cannot be funded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the amendments were out of order, they would not have been selected.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your correction, Sir Patrick. However, I still wish to hear the Minister's views on whether such a proposal can be funded through legal aid, which is the resource of the Lord Chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The second paragraph of the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill gives the Lord Chancellor powers, with the approval of the Treasury, to make grants in connection with marriage support services."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quarrel with that. It deals with the requirements in the Bill for certain types of conciliation and mediation, and I await the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister about that. The Bill may not be the appropriate place in which to deal with the matter, notwithstanding the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle thinks that the Government should be involved. I must say, however, with my tongue in my cheek, that his political reputation rests largely on his opposition to the nanny state. It is debatable whether such matters should be dealt with by the Government at all.<br><br>
We could discuss in detail whether it is the degree of intervention and the degree to which the state has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
robbed parents of responsibilities that are partly to blame for the increase in divorce to which my hon. Friend referred. However, that increase is nothing like what we have been given to understand so far in our discussions. The divorce rate has remained almost static since 1986. In fact, it has gone down in the past couple of years. My hon. Friend should not be worrying as if there were an immediate and urgent problem to be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray <span class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) had problems with funding under clause 20. The Lord Chancellor's Department now chairs the interdepartmental committee on marriage, which was set up by the Lord Chancellor. Furthermore, routine grants to organisation such as Relate are now provided through that Department. Therefore, it is precisely in the context of the Bill that such issues should be raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can clarify that point. My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay is right in a sense by saying that responsibility in relation to the law concerning marriage rests with the Home Office. We have heard on several occasions proposals that would affect the mechanisms before someone could become married and that has become part of the debate. It is necessary to consider the formulation of the Bill. But, undoubtedly, departmental responsibility for such issues would be at the Home Office.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray) was absolutely right when he said that the Government have a duty to ensure that the responsibilities of Government Departments are drawn together—the point that I made to the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston). There is a Department of Health responsibility for the work of health visitors who have a role in examining relationship issues, too. I hope that my clarification was helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful clarification. Support for a role for counselling in reconciliation was universal throughout the House yesterday. Many hon. Members talked about the role of counselling in preparation for marriage and about guidance within marriage. The role of counselling during reconciliation must be seen in a wider context. If marriage counselling is to be used only in emergencies, the big hurdle for couples will be to decide whether they have a problem. However, it is quite natural for counselling effort to be drawn upon as a matter of routine by otherwise happy couples engaged in normal family activities; it is a quite natural way of dealing with stress in marriage.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate said, it is important that counsellors should be properly trained. Several organisations already undertake training, but training in what and by whom? We know of Relate—formerly the Marriage Guidance Council—and the Catholic organisation Marriage Care, the Jewish Marriage Council and the Tavistock Marital Studies Institute, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol. East referred to the groups found at various universities. Many others also offer training
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0021">Image</span>

and guidance, but they are all small organisations. Even Relate could not provide a comprehensive statutory national service organised as it is now.<br><br>
To achieve proper marriage counselling, two steps need to be taken. First, counselling should be given a statutory role, and we are in the process of doing that in the Bill. Secondly, we should ensure an adequate flow of funds. As Conservative Members never fail to point out, the Opposition usually ask for Government funding but we should be realistic and look for other sources—but funding for what and for whom?<br><br>
Some people say that the mediation process was conceived by the Lord Chancellor's Department as a cut-price way of reducing the legal aid burden on the Exchequer. Whether or not it works out like that, it would not be easy for counselling services to draw on public money, especially as counselling should be outside the legal process and take place before legal proceedings are started. However, if counsellors were engaged in preparations for marriage, marriage itself would be set in a different context, both socially and in the family. It would also be seen in a different context in financial terms.<br><br>
As Members of Parliament, we and our children have the right to be married in our parish church—St. Margaret's, across the road. Canon Gray, the Rector of St. Margaret's and Chaplain to the Speaker, offers a most delightful framework for such services. Before conducting the service he gives counselling sessions. They are robust occasions to be enjoyed by all who are about to be married. No one need be deterred by the cost of a vast society wedding; the fee is the statutory fee charged by the Church of England and all civil register offices. If the parties live in the same district the fee is £42; if not, the fee is £61. Those fees are modest compared to the cost of the choir, the bells and the reception—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or the flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, or the flowers. If there were a requirement that counselling be available from an appropriately qualified person recognised by an organisation approved by the Lord Chancellor's Department, that would create a different role for such organisations, a different kind of family support. I would imagine that existing counselling organisations would be able to expand on that basis. If they were called on to provide serious marriage preparation on that scale, they might find difficulty in deciding in which doctrine or idea of marriage they were to counsel people.<br><br>
Churches might feel that they could better provide such counselling services, building on the vast amount of human experience that the clergy and others who conduct services already have in that field. That could be backed up by proper training and resources that churches simply cannot provide today.<br><br>
If we do the sums and work out how much funding would become available for marriage preparation, we realise that it would not go far towards meeting the cost because people now tend to get married more than once in a lifetime.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
There would still be a continuing role for marriage counsellors at other stages of family life. Over the years, the groups within which families socialise change. The first is the peer group in which a couple meet each other. It may have a range of social activities such as annual ski holidays with old college mates, Young Farmers club meetings, or whatever. A later group forms around the maternity clinic—through the National Childbirth Trust, for example. This group comprises mums who have had their babies at around the same time as each other. Such social organisations are powerful and provide valuable social support to isolated young mums who are trying to live with their kids in a community in which they may not know anybody else.<br><br>
At a later stage, the parent-teacher association is where families experience common problems with their children's education. All of those groups are perfectly normal and need support. They are all concerned with the health of the family and thus have a continuing role. A properly functioning church can provide a continuity of engagement, but few couples can stay within the serious influence of any one organisation throughout their lives.<br><br>
I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Eltham, who seeks increased support for research into what is happening socially. However, I warn him against using the Treasury model as an example. The idea of careful statistical analysis is important, but enormous hazards are involved in drawing any policy conclusions. If the hon. Gentleman talks to demographers, or to the people who carried out the survey to which I referred on Second Reading—the Wellcome report on sexual behaviour in Britain—he will realise that, although such research is fundamental, it is difficult and enormously vulnerable to sharks, fraudsters and people who want to grind an axe without any real commitment to or understanding of that research. Researchers must be aware of their own social and other assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the economic model has been useful in allowing discussion? The basis is provided by the cohort studies, by National Children's Bureau pamphlets such as "Born to Fail" and by research work started by the late Keith Joseph on the cycle of deprivation, which produced positive results in the insights that it provided. Learning from what the hon. Gentleman said, we should not expect a model to work. The Treasury model would not allow any manipulation that reduced unemployment and inflation at the same time, because the modeller said that that had never happened. We are trying to reduce divorce and distress at the same time, and I expect that that can be made to happen.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with the hon. Gentleman that important theories can be tested within the framework. The generations are extremely unstable in their attitudes. There has been a huge swing in attitudes over the past 30 years, and there is likely to be another huge swing in the next 30 years.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
I do not know in which direction it will go, but I observe that the young notice and learn from the experience, for better or worse, of their parents' and grandparents' generations.<br><br>
As I said on Second Reading, I believe that the major cause of the increase in divorce is that, for the vast majority of the population, early experience of sexual intercourse does not take place in the context of marriage or preparation for marriage. The bonding that held people together for better or worse in marriage in former generations no longer applies in the same way. That is the theory; it may or may not be right. I would hate anyone to start drawing conclusions for policy on any such grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the courageous and unfashionable statement that he has just made. May I inform him that the leading marriage guidance researcher in the Catholic Church has produced one solid statistic which strongly upholds the hon. Gentleman's view: in the minority of cases where marriage has not been preceded by a period of cohabitation, the divorce rate is much lower than the average.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With results like that, we must always ask whether there were other factors that led the couple not to cohabit and whether those factors explain the behaviour and may also be found in couples who have cohabited. I am entirely at one with the hon. Gentleman—let us range over these issues. The practical human lessons of the experience are knit into the evolving behaviour of society, so the system is a dynamic one in which feedback plays a significant role. Policy is by no means the sole or main determinant.<br><br>
There is a great deal of social business that we cannot deal with in the Bill, but the major new departure that we can make through it—and which I think we are likely to make, given some of the amendments—is to provide a statutory role for marriage counselling. Certainly within the divorce process, and I would have hoped also within the marriage preparation process, that could be written into the Bill. Once that is written in statutorily, it invites the question how it can be delivered in terms of practical organisation, training, types of body, professionalism and, of course, the financing of all that.<br><br>
The topic is extremely popular in human terms. It offers a great deal to future media gurus and parliamentarians wishing to make a splash. We are going to see a lot of action, and I hope that the Bill is only the first step on that route.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Among the many ambitions that I cherish but wonder whether I shall ever achieve is to be a better gardener. I am easily fazed by bushes that suddenly sprout large quantities of aphids or seem to be dying back in an unattractive way. People tend, all too readily, to leap at the suggestion that things should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
be replaced at great expense, even though it is hit or miss whether the replacement thrives any better than the original under my unskilled care.<br><br>
I cannot help feeling that we have a culture in which large numbers of married people think it a first recourse either to threaten or to undertake a divorce. Far too few people are encouraged to believe the proposition that, to continue my analogy, pruning, feeding or spraying would achieve a positive result. When people hit a bad patch—for example, one of the partners commits adultery or lays a violent hand on the other; not regularly, but as a one-off in frustration—there is an instant feeling that they should seek a divorce. Once that wheel has started to turn, it is immensely difficult to turn it back, not least because of a feeling of loss of face as the people concerned might have told their friends that they were divorcing.<br><br>
Some people believe that they are being supportive by encouraging a friend to think that his or her partner has behaved disgracefully or scandalously, saying, "I don't know how you've stuck him so long", and all those other phrases that come rolling out. Far from living in a supportive community—in which friends say, "Why not see whether we can help you to work this out; we'll give you support while you work it out"—there is a tendency to rush into divorce. I shall be a great supporter of the Bill if it slows down couples, giving them time for reflection. As a number of hon. Members have pointed out, many eventually passionately regret that they severed the marriage.<br><br>
I fervently support the proposal for family impact statements to be attached to legislation. If we can require Government Departments to say what effect their legislation will have on small businesses, there is no reason why Departments should not attempt to forecast the outcome of their proposals on the family. They will not always get it right—none of us always gets it right in such difficult issues—but if it can be done for small businesses, surely it can be done for that even more important institution, the family.<br><br>
I reiterate something that I said last night—I believe that the vast majority of people enter a marriage in the hope, if not the expectation, that it will be a success. They do not enter into it because they want a party or to impress their friends, but because they believe that it is a chance for happiness. The disappointment, which is often speedy, when they find that their expectations are not being met, or easily met, is tremendous. However, given their initial motivation, the opportunity exists to help them make marriage a success, but our society is extraordinarily clumsy in helping them.<br><br>
One of the paradoxes of the late 20th century is that we have the most intrusive media—matters which even our parents, let alone our grandparents, would have thought it extraordinary to expose to public-discussion are dealt with in the media, in journals and on the airways. That so-called openness is accompanied by an extraordinary increase in the isolation of couples and families.<br><br>
I often think that the characteristic symbol of the late 20th century in Britain is the front door. People
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
return from their fragmented places of work—some over long distances, others from just around the corner—they rarely speak to one another in the street; they shut their front doors and are instantly enclosed in a society with an extraordinarily small range of outside contacts. Often, that is what people really want—they want protection from their neighbours; they want privacy, so they plant hedges. The casual friendship and support of the local group seems to have broken down in many parts of the country.<br><br>
Clearly, that is generalisation of the wildest sort, but couples of whatever age who hit trouble in their relationships find it difficult to talk about their problems, share them or find support from outside. As people increasingly live at considerable distances from their parents and older family connections, they often receive no support from them. Allowing their children to stay with granny for four or five nights while they sort out their problems is no longer possible because many people find that the fare home to granny is a real deterrent.<br><br>
As has been dramatically stated in Committee, one of the elements in the background of our society is that grandprents are engaged in a degree of activity—whether at work or because they are enjoying their retirement in the most energetic, active and self-absorbed way—so they are not available to help as they once would have been. At the beginning of the century, the average woman had 10 years between her youngest child leaving home and death. Nowadays, that period might well be about 40 years. I am delighted that that is the case, but it is no good pretending that a granny with 40 years of active life ahead of her will be so grandchild-concentrated as a woman at the beginning of the century who lived around the corner, even though she might have been exhausted by having a large number of pregnancies—whether or not they were successfully brought to term.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay—which will surprise her as we do not often share entirely the same view in politics—that we must be wary about using legislation to construct what is probably already a fading model of what we would like to see in society. We should make it easy for people to seek the help that they need or the support that they want to bring up their children successfully. That is important.<br><br>
I am nervous about whether we in the House can pick up where—as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said last night—2,000 years of Judaeo-Christian tradition appears to have failed so singly and, by the stroke of a legislative pen, safeguard marriage for the foreseeable future. That is wishful thinking.<br><br>
I shall give an example of one significant group of people—the navigators who built the railways. It was common among them simply to walk over a broomstick and declare themselves married. That was regarded as scandalous by the rest of society, but it shows, as someone pointed out in last night's debate. that the family long predates our marriage model and will probably long outlast it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Elizabeth Peacock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find my hon. Friend's contribution amusing. Is he aware that in some parts of Lancashire there is still talk of people living over the brush, which means that they are not married but are living together? That has not gone away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that my hon. Friend would confirm that many of the children in such unions are at least as satisfactorily reared as those in marriages, which break down all the time. I am edgy about putting too large a load on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter Sweeney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the statistics indicate otherwise and that the chances of a relationship breaking up are greater for those who are living over the brush than for those who undergo a ceremony of marriage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to hear my hon. Friend's statistics. I would need to know more about where they have been collected and how they have been analysed before I accepted what he said at face value.<br><br>
I am, in some senses, confused about the Bill, partly because many couples will be inhibited from seeking professional help. Setting up a large-scale professional counselling service could prove to be expensive to dissapointing effect. We need to do a great deal more to help and encourage those many, many volunteers—and the many more who would come forward if they were encouraged to do so and the necessary but small resources were available—who provide support for young couples and individuals who have been abandoned or who have split up with their partner. For example, Home Start provides considerable assistance in the most practical forms.<br><br>
As I have previously pointed out, we are talking in many cases about people so young that many people in this Room would describe them in their private conversations as children. I know that when one is talking about one's 16 or 17-year-old son or daughter, one is extraordinarily wary of using the words "child" or "children", but in our circles, they are likely to spend another eight years in education and training before they enter the labour market. In those terms, dependent on us as they still are. we regard them as children.<br><br>
However, an increasingly large number of young people are at that age setting up relationships, whether they marry or are simply cohabiting, and having children themselves. They have little idea of how to manage. They have often come from the sort of home where the model that they received was inadequate and. as a result, they are often looking for something or someone of their own to cherish. They have a baby and then discover that financially they cannot cope. The male leaves the home either willingly because he did not really want a baby at that stage: or unwillingly because the couple has no financial basis to help to cope. The benefits system makes that profitable, in a sense. It gives the baby a much greater chance of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V003P0I0024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
reasonable upbringing if the young male is not in the house.<br><br>
Young couples with a baby are housed at public expense, often inadequately and in a place far away from anywhere they can easily find support. They are frequently overwhelmed with shame, anxiety or guilt because they are unable to stop the baby crying or to look after it properly. In those circumstances, they become increasingly unlikely to receive the help that they need. I want a realistic exploration of how we can make available in every local community the sort of voluntary assistance that people would be only too glad to provide and which would help those young people to realise that theirs is not the only baby who cries all night, that there are strategies for coping and that problems and difficulties can be shared. I believe that, in those circumstances, there would be less risk of breakdown. If couples are given support, the male would stay in the household and a child would have two parents instead of one.<br><br>
I believe strongly that if the Bill is to be of any use, we must make it easier for young couples, both before they get married and while they are married, to be given the sort of assistance and help that they need. We should be wary of going into this a deeply professional, trained area, at great expense, when we could do a great deal better with much less formal and more immediately accessible help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday I argued vehemently against the suggestions of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle on clause 5, but today I agree with the purport of his amendment. However, if it were accepted the long title would have to be amended. I have no doubt that the Minister would gulp at that and seek an adjournment himself—despite arguing against it this morning.<br><br>
On the question of counselling, I fully accept the proposition made by several hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It is vital to consider counselling and, with great respect to the hon. Member for Motherwell, South, I am not sure whether cosy chats with a vicar is exactly what we should have in mind. I am thinking more of a structured approach, considering the problems that undoubtedly arise in marriages, which have their ups and downs. It is a matter of advising, counselling and ensuring that people are aware that marriage is not always a bed of roses. The Bill could be the vehicle for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Bray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has strange ideas of what chats with the clergy are like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a Calvinist; I obviously do not have to say any more.<br><br>
I believe that there should be a much more structured, possibly multidisciplinary, approach. We are discussing mediation. We should also be considering in more detail counselling and reconciliation about which the Bill is silent. I practised as a divorce lawyer for 17 years but, in a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
small town in Wales over a 12-year period. I undertook cases for people who were being divorced for the third time and some of whom were below the age of 30. That is not unusual. Most lawyers have had the same experience, but it shows that teenagers are not fully aware of the problems that they might encounter during their marriage. When a person has been through one divorce, apparently a second divorce is more likely to occur.<br><br>
Lawyers are not universally accepted human beings in society; they are probably lower down the critical food chain than politicians. They have not promoted reconciliation in the past, reconciliation, not because there was no financial incentive to do so, but because they were not trained for it. Divorce pro formas had boxes, to be ticked and asked, "Have you told your client about reconciliation?" and "Have you discussed it with him or her?" Frankly, I did not know where the nearest person was in mid-Wales who was capable of assisting them. That is how bad the situation was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it was pressure from the Law Society a generation ago that persuaded Parliament not to make such a provision a statutory requirement under which lawyers must inform clients about the possibility of reconciliation. Instead it was watered down so that lawyers merely had to state whether they had informed their clients about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not batting for the Law Society. I am critical of such action and I shall not be an apologist for it.<br><br>
The matter of reconciliation is a side, not a core, issue. The Bill is the vehicle for bringing it to the fore and I sincerely hope that it will do so. There will be pious hopes that the Minister will return at some point with an amendment to accommodate such a proposal. However, given the pension-splitting scenario. I do not think that he will return with anything of great moment in the next few months. 1 understand that the pension-splitting idea will be accepted by the Government, but that it will be subject to further research and heaven knows what else, when it should have been in the Bill. On Second Reading, the Minister said that there were many other things to go through before anything could be implemented. However, I shall not spend too much time on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman will not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you. Sir Patrick, stopped me in full flight.<br><br>
The amendment is important: it goes to the core of the Bill. This is a Bill on family law, which means caring and accommodating the family and, of paramount importance, the children of the family. If, and when, a Division is called, I hope that the amendment will be accepted by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is excellent. I am sorry that, because of urgent

business, I missed all of his opening speech. However, I have discovered two things during our debate: first, how much younger grandmothers are now and, secondly, how well endowed we all are with children. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, my hon. Friend the Minister, the hon. Member for Brent, South and I all have more than the average 2.2 children and, at times, we need counselling as a result.<br><br>
