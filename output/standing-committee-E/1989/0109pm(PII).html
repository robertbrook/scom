	<p>[Continuation from col. 84]</p>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may start a more peaceful session than our ealier one, in which such courtesies somehow got lost, by wishing you, Dame Janet, a happy new decade. I am sure that that will not be the length of this Committee stage, although to do justice to the Bill and to the people of the United Kingdom we should perhaps keep it in Committee that long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I follow my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) by stating that I am a member of the General and Municipal Workers Union although not one of its sponsored MPs. That involvement often brings the advantage of meeting people who work in the machine rooms of the Health Service and, indeed, the machine rooms of social services care. That is not a declaration of interest but a declaration of my qualification to speak for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also follow my hon. Friend's passionate practicality in proposing an amendment which is both simple and practical. The Committee would help the country and the House if it accepted that the overlap of functions is extremely important. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) referred to that and to his experience at a professional level. My experience has been as chairman of juvenile magistrates and as a community worker. In both those capacities I can testify to the same need for a close working together of health and social services at a policy level as well as a practitioner level. That is the point I want to underline. It is important that policy level decisions are taken on the basis of knowledge and understanding problems and not simply as a result of a paper or academic level understanding of the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overlap of functions is very important. The experience that many Opposition Members have had, which leads us to this conclusion, surely should be reflected by the experience of hon. Members on both sides of the House in dealing with constituency problems. There are many occasions when a constituent's problems give rise to a need for two letters rather than" one—one to the local authority and one to the health authority to raise two halves of an issue which, for the individual who needs help, is one single problem. Often, the overlap involving the Member of Parliament in helping communication and smoothing the edges of responsibilities between health and social
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
services illustrates, in the direct experience of many of us, the need for this very close liaison to be built into the new institutions of the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned at some of the comments from Conservative Members about the nature of the top policy group that is to be created. The description given in a speech before the Committee was suspended for a brief period suggested that it would be a group of people who will be expected to understand problems simply by reading and shuffling papers in some sort of remote pinnacle of decision making. That is a false idea of good management. It is not what is needed. What is needed is a broad representation within the health authority's decision-making structure, whether at both district and regional level, to include knowledge of the community as well as clinical and caring interests. If members of the committee do not have such qualities we shall have a group of amateurs shuffling papers and abrogating the responsibility to ensure that the best possible service is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It worries those who run the Health Service that it is possible that too few people at senior level in the Health Service—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I know that that does not interest the vociferous hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett). He should listen as he might learn something of benefit to his community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not said a word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not have said a word to the Committee but he has said a great deal, noisily, in the background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There seems to be post-prandial mutterings. A little more quiet would enable me to hear the hon. Gentleman, as I wish to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your protection, Dame Janet. Some Conservatives who are involved in policy making in the Health Service are anxious that there will be too few people on the new health authorities to undertake the important jobs and to gain the necessary understanding of the Health Service. That view has been expressed at party and non-party levels in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that there should be a link and overlap with the social services; that should be understood when policy decisions are taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let there be no misunderstanding about this—on a health authority there is no substitute for people who understand what they are talking about. The problem arises when the catchment of groups from which such people might be drawn is too large for them all to be on such an authority. If the Bill contains various definitions of those who should be included it will narrow the groups from which members are chosen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the hon. Gentleman has not read the amendment. I suggest that he does so before intervening again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The narrow drawing of definitions becomes a problem only if there are too few places on a health authority. That is what worries health authority managers. They know that members of the authorities will be busy people with qualifications that are remote from the running of the Health Service. We have experience of such nominations from the Conservative party. The people appointed may not have the time to devote
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
to gaining the necessary knowledge of the Health Service. This Government's recipe is management by neglect at the top of the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) earlier seemed to be developing the odd Conservative business theory that matters can be dealt with remotely, without practical knowledge of the problems. That is not the way in which local business works best, nor the way in which dynamic business men work, so why on earth should it work in the National Health Service? It is an important service—Conservative Members may understand it in this sense—and an important local business. Business should be dealt with in a hands-on way by people who understand it. We propose that consultation should be built in to ensure that people on the decision-making councils have practical experience and knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prevalence of disability in all categories is 21 per cent. higher in Wales than in England. Even when adjusted to take account of the differing age profiles of the population, it is still 18.5 per cent. higher. The worst comparision is for the most severely disabled people: 5 per cent. for Wales and only 2 per cent. for Great Britain as a whole. It is important to underline the importance of disability in terms of the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is frustration in dealing with disability or other categories of special need at ground level when decisions are made at the remote board, paper-shuffling level. It results in the worst possible service for patients because decisions are made without experience and understanding. In recent years, in contrast, creative work with disabled people has started with a carrot of additional money and has brought together people in the housing authority, social services authority and health authority in each area. Such day-to-day liaison between professionals, decision-makers and members of health authorities has been extremely important and creative. It has been constructive, responsible, efficient and caring, but that liaison and understanding should take place at member level, because members and officers at various levels need to work together as a team, within the health authority, within the social services department and across the boundaries of their decision-making. It is a simple and basic way to approach decision-making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with problems affecting elderly people, it is not possible to separate Health Service concerns from social services concerns. One cannot say, "We shall make the health decisions, and leave it to functionaries at a lower level to make the social services and the health services fit together." The decisions need to be planned and delivered in co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Preventive services are increasingly important for elderly people. In the Bill and the White Paper—so reluctantly produced in response to the Griffiths report—the thrust is towards greater operation of community services. We are told of the importance of linking community services with GP services. We have the community services of the health authority on the one hand, and the home helps and other community services provided by the social services department on the other hand. We have adaptations for the disabled, as an illness or disability becomes progressive. All these are not matters of theory; they are matters
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
of day-to-day practicality, and it is important that they be managed properly for the benefit of the patient or the client of the social services department. These are practical, not theoretical, issues, and they affect the quality of life that flows from the public services that people need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the rush to judgment—it is a slow rush— on community care, which led to the White Paper being produced at the last minute and being tacked on to this Bill to avoid the necessity of having a separate Bill, has not allowed sufficient time to appreciate the problems. The amendment, so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West, seeks to put that right and to build in consultation at the right time in the composition of the health authority, thereby undoing some of the damage that the Bill is in danger of doing. Increasing emphasis and responsibility for community care are placed on the local authority in the White Paper. That demands more liaison, not less. It demands more thought at the policy-making level, not less. The overlap must be at the policy level, and must involve proper accountable development of policy and practice in the Health Service, taking account of the implications that Health Service decisions will have for care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to pay tribute to the individual commitment and creativity of councillors who have been members of health authorities in my area, and to the staff of both the social services and the health authority who have provided competent caring services in recent years, despite the immense problems that have been caused, in effect, by the Government. The creativity of the overlap between the health authority, local government and the voluntary sector has been considerable, and the amendment would encourage that to continue. It is therefore extremely important to accept the amendment and ensure the continuation of that creativity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As everyone else seems to be declaring their interests, I should say that I still hold a fragile membership of the National Union of Mineworkers. I am not sure how long that will last, but it does not have much to do with the price of a pair of forceps or any other aspect of the Bill, as far as I can see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support amendment No. 47. Even if one accepts the spirit of the Bill, and I do not, surely for the sake of efficiency-which appears to be one of the driving forces behind it-and a smooth transition from one regime to the new regime, the draftsmen should have recognised that expertise is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such expertise should be like that frequently provided by those in social security and social services. Often they are the agencies which monitor some of the curious links between people's standards of health and other factors such as social deprivation, domestic problems and housing. It is usually the social services that monitor and report on such factors; they are frequently the first port of call for people in difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that the purpose of the Bill is to make the Health Service more efficient. But surely there are several areas in which social services
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
actively help to promote efficiency and could help the Health Services to be even more efficient. One such area is the drift of medicine towards the preventive end of the spectrum. That move is important to the future efficiency of the Health Service and better health for patients. Social services are often the agencies which can best show whether preventive medicine, or the striving towards it, is making an impact on people's health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, there have been laudable campaigns-some of which have been fronted by the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist), the Under-Secretary of State for Wales—such as those to reduce the rate of respiratory diseases and the high incidence of heart disease. Often the people who suffer from such diseases are missed until it is far too late. Frequently their condition is detected not by general practitioners, hospitals or consultants but by health visitors or paramedics, so to speak—those in the community whose work overlaps both areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the transition from one regime to another, it is vital for the population to see that the new edifice or administration contains the sort of expertise discussed today. If we are to have a more efficient Health Service, including the elements of preventive medicine, it is essential for social services to play, and be seen to play, a role on the new committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members may have puzzled about amendment No. 47 until we saw the leaked document entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Labour's strategy for the Committee Stage of the NHS and Community Care Bill".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) will not mind that because he is into leaking documents. It is his permanent occupation so he will probably appreciate my reading that out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to disappoint the hon. Gentleman but he is mistaken about the confidentiality of the document that he is holding—we distributed it to the Press Gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not mind, therefore, if I quote from page 1 as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We intend to use our schedule of amendments to force the Government to show its hand. If Ministers are unable to accept the amendments we put forward, it will be a confirmation of the worst fears of the Bill's opponents. If they oppose our amendments, Kenneth Clarke and his colleagues will be revealing that their talk of enhanced choice, improved efficiency and greater quality of service was pure rhetoric."</p></blockquote>
When one hears the Labour party talking about quality one immediately starts to count the silver. The Labour party and quality of service do not naturally go together. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) gave us the usual Labour party talk about quality, which means bureaucracy. the Labour party does not talk about quality from the point of view of the consumer, the customer of the Health Service. For the Labour party, quality comes with a bureaucratic structure. It is a matter of patients' organisations of setting councillors on committees and of the appointment of inspectors. It has nothing to do with the quality of service as perceived by the customer of the NHS, who is the patient. The Labour party is preoccupied with organisational structure. That is symptomatic of its entire approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. we are talking not about the Labour party's approach but about the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 47 talks about appointments to the membership of the regional and district health authorities and the hon. Member for Monklands, West spent most of his speech talking about quality. He implied that the guarantee of quality was the input from social services into the appointments of the regional and district health authorities. Those organisations which produce a high quality of service for their customers do so not through inspectorates or bureacracies, or councillors. They do it because they produce what the customer wants. Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury, two successful organisations which produce exactly what their customers want, have none of the bureaucracy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is noticeable that the hon. Gentleman is once again talking about the type of organisation that produces cans of beans. Why will the Government not produce what the customers want, which is that the Bill be withdrawn? The Government is good at talking about quality, but they should set about the business of delivering it. The Labour party is rather better at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Register of Members' Interests shows that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) is sponsored by the Co-operative movement. Some of us want a higher quality of service in the National Health Service than that provided by Co-op over the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is real quality and real customer choice? First of all, it means the ability to choose one's general practitioner. It means that one may vote with one's feet if one does not believe—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have tried to give a gentle warning to the hon. Gentleman that his remarks are not really related to the amendment. I invite him to use his ingenuity and to make his remarks relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 47 deals with the appointment of members to regional district health authorities and requires that there be consultation with the local social services department. The hon. Member for Monklands, West spoke about quality. His assumption was that the participation of social services departments in that process will serve to provide it, but quality is not achieved through the creation of a bureaucratic structure. It will be provided by the other clauses in the Bill, which deal with the choice of general practitioners and which allow the district health authority to decide the contracts with the general practitioners. We do not want a procession of amendments—the purpose of the Labour party's strategy document—aimed at boosting bogus organisations which claim that they speak for patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being a patient in hospital is a transitory experience. A person may be in hospital for two or three weeks before ceasing to be a patient, so it is silly to suppose that any self-appointed organisation can speak for patients. I challenge any hon. Member to say that any organisation that claims to speak for patients has asked for their views. Patients are not consulted by such organisations, so it is nonsense to believe that social services departments are organisations that can define quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning bogus organisations. Does he have any knowledge of organisations such as London Health Emergency, which sucks £50,000 from luckless ratepayers from Labour-controlled London councils? It sets itself up as expert and it is run by a Trotskyist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) spoke of the views of patients' organisations and those who oppose Health Service reforms, but she did not mention London Health Emergency. Although that organisation claims to have 300 affiliate members, it manages to raise only £2,000 a year from them. Most of its money comes from Labour-controlled local authorities. That suggests that the public are not prepared to dig their hands in their pockets to support such an organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed social services departments nominating or advising members of the RHAs and DHAs. Let us consider the Nye Bevan home in the constituency of the hon. Member for Peckham. We are asked to believe that the London Borough of Southwark would be a good organisation to recommend a member of the district health authority, yet in its report to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the Nye Bevan home, Southwark council said that "care assistants"
	<br><blockquote><p>"punished old people who did not want to get out of bed in the winter by leaving windows open. Within a week or so the residents died, usually from pneumonia.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The circumstances in which the windows were left open, and the blankets removed, seemed to us to suggest a sinister pattern, not mere coincidence."</p></blockquote>
The report went on to list a series of incidents in the Nye Bevan home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anne Ward, deputy leader of Southwark council until 1982, said that the then leader of the authority was claimed by managers in Southwark to have had an
	<br><blockquote><p>"'unhealthy' and close relationship"</p></blockquote>
with
	<br><blockquote><p>"other councillors and the manual unions".</p></blockquote>
Surely we are justified in questioning whether the social services department in the London borough of Southwark is the right organisation to decide or to recommend the membership of a regional or district health authority. There is a history of mismanagement in homes run by local authorities. We want quality in the Health Service. That does not come from bureaucratic structures, but from letting customers have the choice, which the Bill will provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 47 is superfluous. We want proper representation on the RHA and DHA and not the representation suggested by some corrupt local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

South-West (Mrs. Bottomley), whether she would be happy for the details of the Conservative party's view on the Health Service to be circulated to constituents. She replied that she was perfectly happy to see that happen. I should be extremely pleased therefore if the speech of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) could be circulated to his constituents who will then be told that he believes that social services departments are bogus organisations. They would welcome the opportunity to read his speech in detail.

Amendment No. 47 has an important aspect. The Opposition believe that the clear liaison between health authorities and social services departments should be maintained. The link that currently exists between the voluntary sector social services and health authorities should also be maintained. Sir Roy Griffiths's report which laid the groundwork for the community care part of this Bill examined the problems of collaboration between social services departments and health authorities. Sir Roy said that there were real problems with collaboration and joint ventures and he highlighted the breakdown which he saw occurring in the relationship unless the Bill addressed the issue of who is ultimately to be responsible for the assessment of people in community care. He recommended that local authorities should be responsible for assessing the needs of elderly people and those with a mental illness before they were either discharged home to their families or put into residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise in their own Bill the importance of social services departments and the valuable work that they do; that has been missed by all the contributions from Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government give social services departments a central role in community care in their Bill but do not seem to accept that they ought to be consulted on the most important parts of the Bill, such as that dealing with the membership of health authorities. That is why Sir Roy Griffiths addressed the issue. He recognised the importance of collaboration and joint planning. He also knew that the breakdown, when it occurred, damanged patients' confidence in the Health Service. New structures are needed to restore that confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relationship between health authorities and social services departments must be cemented and increased by the Bill. Social services departments are now planning for their new role in community care. Because of their new community care responsibilities social services departments are examining a range of issues. They are considering the number of elderly people in the community and the projected increase into the next century. That is important both for them and the Health Service. Because of the increase in the number of elderly people there will inevitably and sadly be an increase in the incidence of dementia and mental illness in the elderly. Initially they will have to be dealt with by the Health Service in the hospitals. Then they will have to be discharged, either into residential or nursing homes, or into the community. It is therefore essential that the two departments collaborate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social services departments are also identifying the number of disabled people and the care that they will need. They are seeing whether there are sufficient
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
carers in the community to look after the increasing number of elderly, mentally ill and disabled people; whether they need long-term hospital care; whether there are sufficient community hospitals for the recuperation of people who have been treated in acute hospitals; whether there are day-care facilities; whether there are residential places for respite care. There is a host of services for which social services departments have new and increased responsibilities as a result of the Government's failure. It would be the height of reason for the Government to accept the amendment. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Pembroke said, the amendment does not involve the establishment of a new bureaucracy, damaging quality or paying people for doing nothing. It requires consultation—talking to people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the Opposition members of the Committee talk to social services departments in our own constituencies about their new responsibilities. The consultations relate not to the responsibilities of social services departments in isolation but to how they fit in with those of the health authorities—which are also invited to the discussions. Common ground is seen. Our consultations include representatives of the voluntary sector, which will have increased responsibility because of the community care provisions. Voluntary organisations are worried about their new responsibilities because they have not been fully told what is entailed. We must ensure the greatest collaboration among the bodies which share the increased responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the social services department in my constituency welcomes the challenge that is contained in the community care provisions of the Bill provided that adequate resources are allocated and that proper training for the staff involved is given. The Government should enshrine in the Bill the right of those bodies to be consulted. The Government should accept the amendment and the enhanced responsibility of social services departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one reservation about the amendment that explains why I think it should be rejected. You, Dame Janet, will remember from our proceedings in Committee on the Water Bill that I had occasion to mention that I live at the extreme southern end of my constituency, some 400 yd from the county boundary. I and about 20 per cent. of my constituents cross that boundary into Oxfordshire to use the Horton general hospital in Banbury. That is in the Oxfordshire health district, although both that and Northamptonshire—the county I have the honour of representing a significant part of—are within the Oxford regional health authority. Many of my constituents emigrate to obtain their major health services— my own general practitioner is located in Oxfordshire. The Brackley Cottage hospital, which is located in Northamptonshire, is administered by the Oxfordshire district health authority. How would that effect consultation as proposed by the Opposition amendments? Is Oxfordshire to consult Northamptonshire social services about an appointment that will be primarily directed towards Oxfordshire, but which may have some relevance to Northamptonshire, or will Northamptonshire's health district take on the obligation to consult social services and provide some answer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that, all too often, because of boundaries and the geography of my Northamptonshire constituency,
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
we tend to be sidelined and have to shout loud to get our voice heard. We do our best. I mention that specific difficulty to underline my opposition to the amendment. Trying to fit acute and general health services in with social services at county level is not necessarily the best way to proceed. My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) put his finger on the Opposition's underlying bureaucratic attitude in proposing the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, the Bill as drafted does not preclude social services from having a voice. Staff of social services departments with Members of Parliament, councillors or members of the general public may put forward suggestions for nominations to appropriate bodies as and when they become available. Good luck to them. Of course there will be consultation. The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) said that social services will have a central role, but let us not confuse the role of consultation with the role of appointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If appointments are made according to the logical and clear structure of the Bill, responsibilities will follow on from that structure. They will not then be muddled up with the confusion that has so often characterised our appointments and our lack of responsibilities in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I declare an interest as a sponsored parliamentary candidate of MSF-[HMs: "What is that?"] It stands for "Michael squirm frantically"—The Manufacturing Science and Finance Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth discussing amendment No. 47 in the context of chapter 8 of "Working for Patients", which outlines the system of appointments already referred to by the Under-Secretary of State for Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of that chapter is as follows. The Minister appoints the non-executive members of regional health authorities and the chairs of the district health authorities, who are paid. The members of regional health authorities appointed by the Minister then appoint a general manager, and together they appoint the rest of the regional health authority, which then appoints the non-executive members of the district health authority, who are also paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The non-executive members of the district health authority, who have been appointed by the regional health authority and the chair of the district health authority whom the Minister has appointed—all of whom are paid—then appoint the general manager of the district health authority. Then, the district general manager, with the non-executive members of the district health authority, appoint the other executive members of the district health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a system of management that Queen Victoria would certainly have recognised when she surveyed the crowned Heads of Europe in 1870! Whether such a system should commend itself to us this evening in our debate on clause 1 is quite another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are full of charity, but if we lacked it we could have said that such a system was a little closed-ended, a little hermetically sealed, a little too quiet and comfortable as these tiers of the great and good, the smaller members, the not so great, the even better— we shall not say "and the not so good"—proceed to appoint each other as they go along.

The amendment, which is minor and in the spirit of glasnost, merely proposes that at some stage in the system members of local social services authority shall consult about who is to be appointed and how the appointments are to be made. It would not give the right to appoint, or establish a quota. It does not specify a number or outline a procedure. It merely seeks to provide for consultation. In the sort of close, tight system that the Minister outlined in chapter 8 of "Working for Patients" there is surely room for a little openness and consultation. That is all amendment No. 47 asks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. He feels strongly on the matter but I am sure that he will recall, as a distinguished former member of a local authority—I also have served on two local authorities —the pressures on local councillors, who have many roles and many jobs. He will know that sometimes local councillors are appointed to health committees despite not having any great interest in health. They are merely filling up numbers. Surely it is better to have a system on which people are appointed to health boards because they have a special and direct interest in health matters and not because they happen to be members of the minority or majority parties of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman but I must say that the system of appointments that I outlined, which the Minister did not contest, is the system in working paper No. 8, which I think would fit better into British Government in the 18th century than British Government in the 20th.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree—perhaps his experience is similar to mine—that members of a local social services authority who become members of a health authority have often put in considerable time and commitment and shown great care and professionalism in their contribution to a health authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I happily recognise that. But amendment No. 47 does not even require us to go that far. It does not even suggest that a local social services authority shall appoint. It does not provide that the people about whom they consult, and recommend, shall be local councillors. In many instances they would not be; they would be members of the community. Authorities would be drawing on a wider body of knowledge and experience in considering who would fit well into the system than the tight, miscegenated Hapsburg-like system that "Working for Patients" described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last evening, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman), responded to a debate about the problems of mental illness, and I agree with much of what he said. He said that in his view local social services did not spend enough on mental illness and mental handicap facilities. He outlined a financial mechanism which he proposed to begin in April 1991 which would, in effect, ask regional health authorities to consult local social services authorities about improving the pattern of provision for mental illness and mental handicap. Amendment No. 47 asks that that system of consultation be a two-way traffic system beginning at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
top. I do not believe that it can reasonably be contested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) made an excellent speech. He will be interested to hear that one person who nodded vigorously throughout the earlier part was the Secretary of State himself, who, together with most of his civil servants, clearly agreed with much of what my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the first time that a Labour Member has shown signs of having read a working paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Secretary of State that when I receive the working papers I shall read them myself—but I have not seen them yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another speech that interested me was that of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe). He is an erudite man; he understands things and reads a lot. But he has not read the amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central remarked, it is not suggested that the social service committees or anyone in the local authority should select or appoint the members of the district health authority. The amendment does not suggest that; it suggests instead that the local social service authority should be consulted and that due regard should be paid to its views. The social services department, the authority or the committee of the authority might decide that it wants to put a policeman or a business man on the district health authority. There is nothing in the amendment to prevent that. I am sure that business men are available, with a wide knowledge of social service matters, who could contribute to the working of a district health authority. The question is where are they. What process of consutation exists to identify who they are, where they are and whether they could do the job effectively if they were appointed? That is why the amendment was tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have said, the amendment widens the process of consultation to include those who may have specialist knowledge. I do not like prolonged debates, but I cannot understand why we are still debating this matter at nearly 9.30 pm. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Surely a statement should have been made at least an hour ago conceding the amendment or at least conceding that the principle behind it had substance and would form part of the consultative procedures expected to be set up by the appointing bodies. I predict that when he replies, the Minister will probably concede much of our argument—I hope that he will not withdraw that concession to the Committee. But for some reason that will not be explained, he will not accept the amendment and will refuse to give an undertaking that on Report he will table an amendment meeting our requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has read the amendment carefully, he will know that it is as meaningless as the clause in the local government Acts that requires local authorities to consult businesses, taking due regard of their views on rating. Like people living in Harlow, which has a hard-Left council, everyone knows that the amendment is meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may think that the amendment is meaningless, but the

	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
director of the social services department in my constituency—or even in his own constituency—would probably say, "It is a damn good idea but I think that at least I should be asked whether the appointment that is about to be made is a reasonable one." He might say that he would like to advise against the appointment of someone because his experience shows that that person would be unfit for public office or could not to the job properly. Unless we are given an undertaking such as the amendment would give—I am sorry to persist in the use of the word "undertaking", but perhaps it is just one of those days—there is a danger that people who do not consider the views of those involved generally in social services will be appointed. The Bill excludes the democratic voice from the new structures that are being set up. That is appalling, as is the whole Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since being elected in 1979, I have sat on many Committees and I cannot think of one Bill—apart from a Finance Bill—when we did not work directly with Conservative Back Benchers. I remember many Bills when Conservative and Labour Members discussed amendments in the Corridor and voted together on them. If we felt that it was better not to move amendments then, we would do so on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman seriously saying that he has done anything today to enhance relations in the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am not saying. I do not pretend that there is a basis on which to work with Conservative Members on the Bill, apart from, perhaps, the question of clinical audit and certain aspects of the community care provisions. The Bill is squalid and appalling and the worst one which I have had to debate since becoming a Member of Parliament. I have sat on many Committees and over the years Labour and Conservative Members have worked together. I have never been involved in one that had so much potential for acrimony between the two sides. It is an angry Bill that polarises the worst position taken by reactionary Conservatives. They know the truth behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my modest contributions are so well appreciated by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exclusion of the democratic voice is the hallmark of the Bill. For many years in the Labour party, discussions on Health Service control reform have been in the other direction. We have always sought to extend the democratic base, while not compromising
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
important principles of efficiency in the management of the service—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members may laugh, but such a position is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Griffiths proposals were produced, I and some other hon. Members had some sympathy with aspects of the recommendations relating to local administration of the Health Service. I make no bones about that. I said so publicly at the time and I retain that view, but there was always a question about balance to ensure that we attained our objective of efficiency while retaining and developing the democratic component.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion in the Labour party ran counter to the argument in the Committee. It concerned the form that democratic accountability should take and the kind of organisation that should exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the Labour party believed, as many still do, that the health authority should be a tier of local government whose elected members had the right to sit on a committee which was responsible not for the management but the monitoring of development and the guidance of managers within the National Health Service. I believe that that could be the way forward in future. The fact that we have had 10 years of Thatcherism, with its concentration on commercialisation and managerial expertise to the exclusion of every democratic principle, does not necessarily mean that we should not reconsider the important debates that the Labour party had several years ago when we took those matters into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another group in the party believed that members of health authorities should be directly elected, as opposed to local authority committees taking on that responsibility. I opposed that proposal at the time on the basis that it would create a new tier of elections which might further confuse the public and result in a very small turnout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to establish that we were thinking about how we could extend democratic arrangements in the Health Service to ensure that the voice of its work force and professionals could be heard, that the consumers who use its facilities were represented and that local authorities had a participating role in decision taking and making recommendations to managers, which is perhaps more important. Managers must manage. I have always believed that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those principles seem to have been turned around. The Bill takes no account of them. Indeed, it moves away from consultation with people in social services departments who were elected and take an interest in their work. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) was a member of a social services committee for a number of years. The Bill moves in favour of managerial professionals who are not democratically accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall relate an experience which shows that the Bill will not deal with the problems of the Health Service which need the attention of democratically elected people. I know a councillor in Manchester who is an uneducated man. He probably left school at the age of 13, but he is a beautiful man with a beautiful mind. He has been chairman of a social services committee. The Secretary of State may know the fine man I am talking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
about. I know where that man has been and in what he has been involved for several years. Whatever he touches seems to work properly. That may be a simple analysis of the man who is councillor Jack Bury; I am sure that the Secretary of State knows him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That councillor has expertise at his fingertips which he gained not by being in business but by being elected to a local authority. He accepted a very small income and concentrated on developing his expertise, especially in housing and social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Jack Bury could have been a millionaire if he had chosen to go into business. He chose not to do that, but to concentrate on caring for other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the likes of Jack Bury will not be appointed to district health authorities. His business acumen is probably better than that of many business men I know. He is able and exceedingly bright, although he was not formally educated, yet the system that is being set up may leave behind the Jack Burys of the world, unless there is a mechanism in the system to ensure that someone will say, "We want Jack Bury" — he is an elderly man now, so it may be someone else, and there are many Jack Burys in the world—"on the district health authority." I want a mechanism for ensuring that the likes of Jack Bury are appointed to such authorities. One is not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill emphasises the need to place on authorities only people who, in a lay capacity, have professional or commercial cut and thrust expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a recurring nightmare. We have had a similar experience in Calderdale, where a wonderful education project is on the drawing board and involves business men. A business in the community initiative involves the same business men. The Secretary of State probably knows their names very well. When the training enterprise councils were announced, I had a bet that the same business men would be on the board. I fear that that will happen again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend illustrates graphically the problem. The Minister may give an assurance, but that will not be enough. I ask for the Secretary of State's attention. If he had taken as much notice of what his Whip said to him today as I wished, the Leader of the House would not have moved the motion in the House this afternoon. I am sure that the Whip will endorse what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I ask is that the Secretary of State ensures that, somewhere in the Bill, there is a requirement on those who appoint to take account of the fact that, although the Jack Burys of the world may not be big business tycoons, they know this business very well. They should, in an executive or non-executive capacity, represent the community and the Health Service on district health authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ninety per cent. of this debate has been uncontroversial because it has covered the need for close collaboration between health authorities and social services departments. There is no contention in the Committee—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) must be patient. I am trying to be rational, reasonable and calm, and to deal with the matters that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the hon. Members for Monklands,
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
West (Mr. Clarke) and for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) failed to convince the Committee by arguing that the essential collaboration between health authorities and social services departments requires cross-membership or at least involvement in appointing members of health authorities by social services departments. The last 10 per cent. of the debate was remarkably unconvincing. We agree that there must be close collaboration. I agree with the arguments of my hon. Friends the Members for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) in that respect. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the arguments of Griffiths II. The second Griffiths report argued for a clear distinction between the roles of the social services departments of local authorities who are responsible for social care, and of health authorities who are responsible for health care. That does not preclude collaboration. Griffiths emphasised the importance of collaboration, but drew a sharp distinction between the two. That distinction extends to cross-membership and the appointment of members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful briefly to remind the Committee of present arrangements under the National Health Service Act 1977—it was cited by the hon. Member for Monklands, West. The membership of regional health authorities ranges from 16 to 19 members. Under the present arrangements for appointing members to regional health authorities, the Secretary of State has a duty to consult about appointments. The relevant local authorities appoint directly between four and six members to district health authorities. Regional health authorities also appoint members to district health authorities. They have an obligation under the 1977 Act to consult, and they do that when appointing members who are not local councillors to the district health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach is different. Some members of district and regional authorities are confused about whether they represent other organisations or are part of a corporate body charged with the responsibility of managing—in the most effective way possible—part of the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) implied that we had not read the amendment. I read it and re-read it. We are discussing consultation and the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) drew a distinction between formal cross-membership and the consultation process, although the amendment states that, after that consultation, due regard should be paid to the authority's views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Due regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that does not necessarily mean that there would be cross-membership. A third party might be appointed. The hon. Member for Workington is unrealistic. A third party might be appointed on the recommendation of the social services authority, but that person would regard himself as a representative of the social services department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister is wrong. He is running a broad brush across every local authority, every service and every chief officer. They recommend people who have an interest in the running of the health authority.

	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When an Opposition Member intervened earlier, I told him that our argument rested on the assumption, proved in countless examples, that some members of district and of regional authorities were confused. Confusion is not conducive to the proper management of the Health Service. Individuals should be appointed on the basis of their personal skills and the contribution that they could make. We do not expect health authorities to be run by ex-bank managers. We do not expect authorities to consist exclusively of business men. They will be managed by people with a range of skills including, as I said earlier, councillors, trade union officials and business men. Individuals will be appointed on the basis of the contribution they can make, and their loyalty will be to the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to clarify the position, when the Secretary of State makes an appointment of a Labour councillor to the Lake District planning board, are we to deduce from what the Minister said today that the Labour councillor should think that he represents the Government when he is appointed? Is that the proposition the Minister is putting to the Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying that the body which appoints is the body being represented. Therefore, the body, in the case of the councillor put on the Lake District planning board, is the Government.

It is undeniable that some members of district health authorities regard themselves as having a prime obligation to the councils they represent, and which have appointed them. That is natural and human nature. We want regional health authorities to review a wide range of potential appointees. They are free to advertise, and we hope that they will consider a broad range of individuals from different backgrounds, as I have stressed before, including some who are existing or former councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that, as an ex-Labour councillor, spokeswoman for social services and a member of the district health authority, my prime concern was always the person who needed care —either NHS or social services care? The only time that we had what the Minister would call political input was when massive cuts were suggested for either service. Labour councillors then fought like mad to
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
keep both services going. One or two people were sacked. The deputy chair of my health authority at Calderdale, a woman—it is rare for women to take the chair—was one because she fought too hard for the patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not insulting for the Minister to suggest to people who have given many years' dedicated service that all they are interested in is making a cheap political point? That is not true. The only people in recent years to make such points are those appointed by the Government. The general managers and chairs who stick in their jobs year in, year out and implement the Government's cuts are good examples of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On reflection, if the hon. Lady reads my remarks, she will find that I have not cast any such aspersion, although there is no doubt that politics are introduced into the proceedings by some health authorities. All I said was that some members of some district health authorities feel that their prime loyalty is to the councils that appoint them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the few remaining minutes, Dame Janet, I shall deal briefly with the points raised by the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and others about collaboration, because that is extremely important. Although several hon. Members have referred to "Working for Patients" no one other than the hon. Member for Monklands, West has yet referred to the White Paper on community care. If they troubled to read that document, hon. Members would find in chapter 6 extensive reference to the need for very close collaboration between health authorities and social services departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No change is proposed in the Bill to alter the present position of joint planning and joint finance. More than £100 million per annum is spent through Department of Health Votes on joint finance on projects between health authorities and local authorities, but the White Paper gives a commitment to look again at the effectiveness of joint finance. If it can be improved, we want to improve it. The hon. Member for Monklands, West knows that joint consultative committees were set up under section 22 of the National Health Service Act 1972. We want to look carefully at whether that is the best mechanism to achieve collaboration. There are no proposals in the Bill to change the system, but we are considering carefully whether it can be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One requirement will be that local authorities should draw up community care plans. They will have to achieve that in collaboration with health authorities. That is provided for much later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) mentioned mental illness. He acknowledged that the Government propose that regional health authorities provide new money—a special grant from 1991—to the relevant social services departments. It is for mental illness, not mental handicap. The hon. Gentleman seemed to confuse the two. We believe firmly that that mechanism will inevitably provide for close collaboration between the National Health Service and local authorities on care for the mentally ill in the community because the additional money will be available. We expect local authorities to prepare their community social care plans on the basis of planning agreements which involve health authorities.

	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
The burden of my argument is that the closer relationship between local and health authorities that we all want can best be served not by confusion about cross-membership or about who a member of a health authority owes his loyalty to, but by close collaboration between two separately defined bodies which are appointed separately. That way lies clarity, closer collaboration and greater success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify whether the grant is to be a capital grant, a revenue grant, or both?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we propose is to be administered by way of pump-priming funds which are both capital and revenue in nature. By pump-priming I mean that the intention is to help local authorities to provide better accommodation—bricks and mortar—and additional staff. We plan to announce details of the scheme later in the year. The amount available from April 1991 will be part of the public expenditure survey round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West said that if the Bill is enacted without his amendment, the close collaboration between social services departments and health authorities will not take place. The reverse is the truth. I invite the Committee to resist the amendment because only with separation of the roles and the bases of appointment can collaboration be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time, alas, does not allow me to refer to the excellent speeches of my hon. Friends and of the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) in support of a reasonable and modest little amendment. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friends agree that their first-class speeches were, in terms of making converts and obtaining support for the amendment, surpassed by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), whose excessive contribution was the best invitation of the night to all reasonable members of the Committee to give their support to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the days of Tom Mann, consumerism has been extremely important, and we seek to reflect that. The tragedy—to develop the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours)— is that not only will Jack Bury not be appointed but his views will not even be taken into account. Where is the democracy in that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Speech made by the hon. Member for Pembroke
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
was a mixture of sycophancy and paranoia. His sycophancy led him to look from time to time at the Secretary of State as though we were asking not for consultation, but for arbitration. I realise that the word "arbitration" is repugnant and unacceptable to Conservative Members—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If hon. Members keep interrupting my remarks, they will have to return to the Committee after the Division in the House. The principle has already been established, not in the so-called leaked document, which I had hoped to distribute three or four days before this sitting, but in the Bill. Under schedule 1, which deals with the constitution of health boards, is it provided that appointments shall be made after consultation with bodies such as local authorities. Surely, a principle that is already established for Scotland is not acceptable for the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who seemed to be opposing the amendment, was, in fact, opposing the entire Bill. Much as we should like to do that, we do not have the opportunity to do so in this short debate. The arguments for the amendment are overwhelming, so I invite the Committee to show its support for it and, if necessary, press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
