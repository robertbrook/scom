<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
<p>[continued from col. 393]</p>
<p>8.50 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchtnan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5 is clearly at the heart of the Bill. The Opposition are dedicated to frustrating it. Delay is the secret of the tactics that the Opposition feel that they can use to frustrate the Bill. We know that from the excellent document that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) so kindly circulated to the Press Gallery, and via that to the Committee. The Opposition believe that by creating a system of ballots they will make it impossible for more than a few units, whether hospitals or other establishments, to opt out —as the Opposition would say—or to become self-governing trusts—as Consevative Members would say. That proposal is at the heart of the Bill, and the part that the Opposition are most dedicated to frustrating, because it finally gets to grips with the inertia—<i>[Interruption.]</i> We listened to the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) with a courtesy that she does not seem to be keen to offer to others.<br><br>
The self-governing trust finally offers an opportunity to break down the inertia and waste that is virtually endemic in the Health Service. It will do that by fragmenting the organised groups of labour. I choose that term as a description not of the Opposition but of the work force in all grades, whether clinical and professional, or ancillary, workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay (Barnsley, West and Pennistone)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does it surprise the hon. Gentleman that in my surgeries it is not Labour supporters who are worried about that, but ex-Conservative voters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised in the slightest, in view of the enormous amount of disinformation and misinformation that has been put about, by the Opposition, and by the BMA in the notorious leaflets that it circulated through surgeries. Unfortunately, people do not understand what is proposed or the way in which the clause will work to the advantage of the patient and the Health Service. Organised labour—by which I mean the BMA, nurses' organisations and TUC-affiliated trade unions—is worried that what it has relied upon in order to control the Health Service— organised labour and national pay bargaining—will break down. The Opposition see ballots as a way of postponing the foundation of self-governing trusts until after the next election. When this group of amendments—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I have finished my sentence I shall be delighted to give way to the hon. Gentleman. When this group of amendments is defeated, I do not doubt that the hon. Member for Peckham will issue press releases. Indeed, she may have done it already. She has probably presumed the result of the vote and already written the first draft. The hon. Lady will say that the Conservative majority on the Committee is anti-democratic. My hon. Friends and I are not against democracy. We are in favour of democracy at the ballot box at the general election. We are sent here as representatives and not as delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman says. Is he suggesting that NHS trusts, the opt-out hospitals, will be set up on the whim of the Secretary of State for Health or the Secretary of State for Scotland without any pressure from other organisations and without any assessment of views?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not doubt that DHAs will conclude overwhelmingly, that self-governing trusts will be a way of breaking down the great block of national pay-bargaining—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is too much noise and it makes it difficult for me and for <i>Hansard</i> staff to hear. I am sure that no disrespect is intended. It would help if we could have a little more quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not humbug for the Opposition to talk about democracy? The Palace of Westminster is the home of democracy. Last Friday, when we were debating the Health Service and the Opposition's policies towards it and towards devolution, they were all in Scotland attending a sham convention rather than here at the home of democracy carrying out their duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I shall wind up because all my hon. Friends wish to oppose the amendments with their own speeches.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Livingston has slipped somewhat. [Hon. Members: "Where is he?"] I do not know. He is probably still having his supper. Is he sorting out the ambulance dispute? <i>[Interruption.]</i> He is on the television, is he? In moving amendment No. 33 he suggested that there should be a ballot of all the people living in the catchment area of the hospital or other establishment. Amendment No. 33 does not say that. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State will make no such order unless he has first held a ballot of all those living within the district in which".</p></blockquote>
They are two different things. The catchment area, especially of long-stay mental hospitals, may be as large as four London boroughs, four health districts, or even larger in rural areas. Such a ballot would be based on an artificial electoral roll. It would therefore be impossible to have a ballot based on a catchment area. But the amendment refers to a district rather than a catchment area. Therefore, all those who live in the catchment area of a hospital would be disfranchised from such a ballot. It would be meaningless.<br><br>
If the spurious ballots about which the hon. Member for Livingston waxed so eloquently had any currency, their questions would have made it clear that the NHS trusts will remain within the ambit of the NHS. The term

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
"opt-out" is the basis of the disinformation put about by the hon. Gentleman for almost a year now. I shall have no difficulty in voting against all the amendments.</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 36 is a modest amendment which would require the agreement of DHAs before any proposal to opt-out could be made or any interest in opting out could be pursued. It follows on from the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), which would require ballots at various levels. I am worried that the legislation will accord dictatorial powers to managers in the NHS. The nature of NHS management has changed over the past few years. The hospital and health authority managers whom I met when I was a member of a CHC in the 1970s and early 1980s were qualified and trained in NHS administration, and they were committed to the collective principles of the NHS.<br><br>
Since the Griffiths report on NHS management in the early 1980s, however, a new breed of manager has appeared. Many of the new managers are brought in from private businesses, or have other backgrounds irrelevant to the NHS. They are not committed to the principles of the NHS. I am worred about their powers, which will enable them to take decisions on behalf of patients and on behalf of hospital and community nursing staff, to express an interest in opting-out, and to transform the NHS in a way that we have not seen since the 1946 Act.<br><br>
I question the motivation of some of the managers in my constituency and elsewhere who have expressed an interest in opting-out, and wonder what they have to gain from it. Some may genuinely believe, because of their background in private commerce or industry, that the service will be improved by the new system. Some may believe, as do some Conservative members, that the market system is appropriate to health care. I disagree, and do not believe that it will offer a local health service to my constituents. I suspect that many others realise that they will gain personal financial advantage as a direct result of their health authority expressing an interest in opting-out.<br><br>
The Government are especially secretive about performance-related pay, and I have raised questions about it on several occasions. Highly-paid district and unit general managers receive payments for achieving aims that are not known to health authorities or to the public. Bonuses are paid, for example, for completing closure programmes and for discharging patients from psychiatric hospitals. I am worried about such financial incentives. Those proposals are not subject to public scrutiny. I have asked the Secretary of State for Health about the bonuses in connection with the opt-out proposals. I have received the vague answer that performance-related bonuses for district general managers who successfully steer through an expression of interest would be a matter for hospital trusts. I suspect that many unit and district general managers will realise the personal financial benefit of opting out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to help the hon. Gentleman with his earlier question—why people in our constituencies are considering the possibilities of self-governing hospital trusts. Does not he realise that local people think that they may be able to make better judgments than the present health boards, which are remote from their needs?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my constituency and in the health authority within it the opposite is the case. The people who are expressing an interest have no personal loyalty to Wakefield, as most of them do not live in the area, and have been imposed upon the health authority under the Griffiths's proposals.<br><br>
As Conservative hon. Members have said, the legislation gives managers incredible powers far beyond their present ones.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that Health Service managers will receive Government money if they push their services towards NHS trusts is either hysterial or extremely sinister. It behoves the Gentleman to justify or document it if he wants us to take it seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with a copy of the parliamentary answer that I received to a question about performance-related pay for district general managers who steer their services towards opting out. The answer was vague and gave me the impression that it was highly likely that there would be a financial advantage for those people.<br><br>
Some district general managers will foresee the way in which opting out will relieve them of many of their present problems. The legislation will give managers increased authority over the services within their areas. They will then be rid of the local accountability of DHAs. District general managers can be asked awkward questions. I say thank goodness for the union member and four local authority staff who sit on my authority, who are the only people who ask the district general manager about his odd schemes. I suspect that one motivation for district general managers' expressions of interest is that they want to rid themselves of a process whereby the local people elected through democratic ballots who sit on local authorities and represent local interests on the health authorities. Those people will rightly ask awkward questions. The district managers simply want to rid themselves of the current structure to move away from the limited accountability that exists to local people within the existing health authority structure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another reason is that with the changes people will go from DHAs to employment in the new self-governing trusts. The Government are clearly maintaining an arm's length relationship, and the lack of a pay restraint policy might mean that people will seek to secure more highly remunerated pay levels within the new trusts. That is a clear incentive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I supsect my hon. Friend's assessment is correct. District general managers now earn about £35,000 a year in the Yorkshire regions, which is a sizeable salary. They also receive performance related bonuses. Those are secret bonuses given for achieving aims that no one knows about—even MPs cannot ask.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said, the divisions between the lowest paid people, who do the cleaning and portering and whose wages have been driven down through competitive tendering, and managers will be worsened by this legislation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0557">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
The local proposals to opt out that we have received show that an attractive feature of the legislation is the way in which the local health authority can get away from the nationally organised and agreed payments and conditions of employment for people who work in the NHS.<br><br>
I said that amendment No. 36 was a modest amendment. It is so modest that I suspect that if the Government applied it to Wakefield it would not make a ha'p'orth of difference because the Wakefield health authority is entirely unrepresentative of the people in its area. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said, there are areas of concern and health authorities have voted against expression of interest and opting out.<br><br>
The Bill says nothing about the procedure before the Secretary of State makes an order under clause 5(1). Amendment No. 36 contains a reasonable and fair suggestion and I hope that the Government will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) said: I admit that when the word "ballot" is mentioned it sends a slight shiver down my spine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a spine?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should have a moment's silence because the hon. Gentleman cracked a joke that was reasonably funny.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was the hon. Gentleman "reasonably funny"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) is funny. There has been no doubt about that since he was elected.<br><br>
Some years ago when I stood unopposed for the vice-presidency of my student's union there was a misprint in the constitution which said that those who stood should perform or be elected by ballot—that is true and no one has bothered to change the rules!<br><br>
I admire the intellect of the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and the mischievous way in which he has moved his amendments but, with respect to him. I thought that some of this suggestions bordered on intellectual lunacy until I heard the speech of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). It was a fantastic experience to join that hon. Gentleman along the white-coated road to the Disneyland of conspiracy theory. The hon. Gentleman is a walking conspiracy, but I shall happily give way to him.</span></p>
<p>9.15</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Later in the proceedings on this Bill, I shall bring before the Committee a speech which I made on the Transport Bill in 1981, in which I made predictions about the effects of deregulation. They were denied by the then Secretary of State for Social Services, but they came true within four years, because I understand how the market works. Everything which I have said—if I catch your eye later, Dame Janet, I shall speak further on these matters—will happen. I understand the market and the hon. Gentleman does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rather like the hon. Gentleman,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
although I am not sure whether it is because he has a smile like the brass plate on a coffin or because he is the sort of gentleman who would raid a box of liquorice allsorts just to make sure that there was not a blue one in it. However, what the hon. Gentleman said was straying from reality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If there is any straying, it is by the hon. Member from the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are absolutely right, Dame Janet, and I bow to the Chair. The hon. Member of Workington does not understand the fundamental difference between a trust and a business. A business has to look after its shareholders, but trusts have to look after their beneficiaries, and the beneficiaries of these trusts are the patients in the Health Service.<br><br>
This set of amendments is about balloting, and the hon. Member for Livingston knows that what he put forward, interesting as it was, is completely unworkable. It was nothing more than mischievous politicking. I put it to him earlier that when a hospital closes, there is no ballot. There is consultation with the CHC, which is the property appointed statutory body for that. From the way in which the Opposition put it, one would suspect that the Secretary of State in the loneliness of his office, lighting a cigar behind closed doors without consultation with anyone, would decide. That is patent nonsense to anyone who has listened to what my right hon. and learned Friend has said on the Floor of the House on several occasions, where he has made it absolutely clear that the DHAs, CHCs and RHAs will be consulted, and most important of all, that consultants and staff working in the hospitals will be consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is neither poor nor particularly ignorant, except on this subject. It has been made clear on the Floor of the House—<i>Hansard</i> can be referred to - and there is flotilla of civil servants at the back of the Committee—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Are we not discussing the provisions of the Bill rather than conversations and comments which may be made by Ministers whose tenure of office may be ephemeral?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should be discussing amendments to a certain portion of the Bill and not merely the Bill. Perhaps that could be borne in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has shown that he knows a little about some things and absolutely nothing about everything else. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, on a number of occasions on the Floor of the House, has shown and said that there will be consultation. The decision will not be made in isolation. It would be foolish if the Committee did not take account what has been said on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
Let us consider the reality. The hon. Member for Workington referred to the Select Committee, he knows—or should know if he has read the report—that there was a minority report, signed by the majority of the Conservative members of the Committee. This stood true then as it stands true today: we said the plan would divide communities and hospital staffs, lead to bitterness and divert valuable time and resources away from patient care.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0558">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If those are the horrendous consequences, does that not suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the legislation is a thoroughly rotten and socially divisive work in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no. The hon. Gentleman is an intelligent—and amiable individual who generally makes fairly sensible comments on health. As my hon. Friends have made clear, it is not a question of hospitals opting out of the Health Service, as the literature from various Left-wing Labour councils, especially in my constituency, would have us believe. It is all very well to talk about wonderful polls and their questions. On the face of it, some appear quite reasonable, but one need only examine the literature accompanying those questions to see how public opinion was massaged to obtain the results that Opposition Members would want.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr Kennedy) is wrong. It cannot be right that many constituencies have such long waiting lists. Moreover, despite the enormous sums that the Government have pumped into the Health Service, it cannot be right that inefficiencies and major problems still exist. That is why this action was necessary.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr Couchman) made an interesting point. Ballots and consultation of the local community have been mentioned, what is the local community for Guy's hospital or Bart's hospital? What is the locality? For those hospitals, with many others that have large cross-boundary flows, people come from this or that health authority in the home counties area, or even from all over the country. How would those people be balloted? Amendments have been tabled about balloting consultants, staff and all kinds of people. What will happen if people in a so-called locality or community want a hospital to become a self-governing NHS trust, but those working in the hospital disagree? Who will make the decision and on what criteria? It would have to be the Secretary of State. The amendments have been tabled for nothing more than mischievous reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman always makes interesting speeches. Why are the Government so opposed to local ballots on ths issue, whereas on schools opting out of local education authority control and housing opting out of local authority control they suggested ballots? Why are the Government so opposed to ballots in this instance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked a good question and I can give him an answer quite simply. When tenants want to choose, by ballot, between a private and public landlord, the constituency is clear; the issues are clear.<br><br>
The government introduced democracy to the trade union movement and Labour Members voted against it.<br><br>
In one of his more lucid moments, the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) talked about schools, but the legislation makes it clear who must be balloted. The amendment is not clear, it muddies the waters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman define the constituency of a school?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have to define it because it is in the legislation. The clause is reasonable and sensible. Consultations will be held with medical staff, those who run the hospitals and most importantly, the CHC, the statutory body that looks after the interests of the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am mindful of the natural desire of legislators not to peg down with hasty promises of consultation any legislation as radical and wide-ranging as the Bill. I support the amendments because of that radical nature. The Bill is the most major review of the NHS for 40 years, and clause 5 lies at the heart of that review.<br><br>
For better or worse, communities have grown used to, and taken for granted, the relatively stable structure and character of the NHS. The Bill will transform that character. It is thus essential that there is a mechanism for the community to share in determining the shape of the creature that will emerge when the legislation is enacted.<br><br>
The Government claim that the Bill will liberate patient choice. They will sabotage that purpose if they do not allow the initial choice of patients and potential patients to express their views on the Health Service. Conservative Members are adamant in opposing the amendments, and that betrays two predilections. The first is an extraordinary faith in the process that gives the Secretary of State overweening powers in a service that is central to our society. The second is their unaccountable mistrust of the processes of democracy. They claim that mistrust derives from geographic and demographic technicalities. I suspect that it derives from their lack of confidence in the Bill, which is generated by its reception in the country.<br><br>
The Government should consider how communities will receive the Bill when they discover that they do not have a say in determining the character of their Health Service. It will be turned over to bodies that can best be described as quangos. In Wales, there is a profound mistrust of quangos, whether they are appointed by a Labour of a Conservative Administration. At heart they are undemocratic and their impact on an essential service like the NHS could be profound in a service as essential as the NHS.<br><br>
9.30 pm<br><br>
People, especially the young, are disillusioned with the political machinery in Britain. The proposal will disillusion them even more. I therefore hope that the committee will at least accept amendment No. 36, if not all the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr Cook) will probably accept that there are two matters on which both parties have common ground. They are: that the clause is crucial to the Bill; and that it raises the question of the credibility of what lies behind the Bill and the White paper.<br><br>
I refer to both subjects on Second Reading. I said then that I had listened to the hon. Gentleman with considerable assent at times over the past two years. I have considerable respect for his work on health matters. However, I regret that he is proposing spurious and - I shall argue - irrelevant ballots all over the country. I notice that one of the amendments mentions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0559">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
that a hospital in my constituency might be involved in balloting.<br><br>
I said on Second Reading that the hon. Member for Livingston might turn out to be right—I spelt out the consequences of that possibility—or wrong. If the latter, the thousands of people to whom he referred who voted in the ballots condemning NHS trusts, will feel a little foolish at having been led up the garden path. I also said that I would have no objection, after an NHS trust had been running for a couple of years, to a consultative ballot in the area to see what people thought of the trust's performance, although I do not want to tie down my hon. Friends on the Front Bench. If there has not been an improvement or if there has been a deterioration, my right hon. and lady Friend the Secretary of State and the people managing the trust would have to consider that.<br><br>
Such a ballot would be realistic. The ballot that the Opposition are proposing would be a waste, because it would be open to distortion and propaganda from vested interests, and from the Opposition, even before it was set up. I suspect that this is the Labour party's revenge on the Government for having successfully carried through, over the past 10 years, postal ballots in trades unions' affairs, which were resisted by the Labour Government.<br><br>
There is a considerable difference between requiring providers of a service, or producers of goods, to be subject to a ballot before they inflict inconvenience on the wider community, and the Opposition's proposal. Conservative Members argue that our reforms, of which NHS trusts are a key part, will provide a better service for the community. Of course, that may be inconvenient for some of the producers or providers of services in those trusts. We have discussed the power of the trusts to negotiate pay, but I do not want to be tempted down that path by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). Several of my hon. Friends, and a growing number of electors, will be attracted by the idea of more flexible pay arrangements which take account of local labour markets and regional differences. They might even encourage support for NHS trusts, perhaps in an eventual ballot.<br><br>
I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister for Health would spell out the advantages that will flow from the setting up of NHS trusts, because there is great superstitious opposition to them.<br><br>
Little reference has ben made to consultation, but the Government have made it clear in the document "Self-Governing Hospitals—an Initial Guide" that they expect all applications for trust status to be subject to proper consultation undertaken by the RHA. It will cover a wide range of interests: the local community health authority, the CHC, local GPs and the staff of the potential trust. The Governmnet will issue further guidance on consultation in due course; without consultation, the proposals will not work. But consultation is not the same as giving various interests the right of veto.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) that the amendments are a red herring designed to hold up progress towards the implementation of the Bill. I shall support the Government when we vote on them.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not normally provoked into replying to comments from Conservative Members but two issues need clarification.<br><br>
Much has been said about guidance on the requirement that the various levels in the Health Service consult. If Conservative Members believe in that, they should support the inclusion of consultation in the Bill. The difference bewteen the Bill and legislation connected with the closure of hospitals is that there is a statutory legal requirements on the CHC and other bodies to be involved in consultation leading up to decisions made at a local level by the DHA or passed through to the RHA or ultimately to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
If Conservative Members believe in this process, as comments by the hon. Members for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) and for Taunton (Mr Nicholson) suggest, they should accept the need to embody in the Bill the requirements to consult representatives, if only the CHC, to ensure that the relevant authorities consult the local community before they decide whether they support the setting up of a trust or the closure of a hospital. We ask that the legal framework for the closure of hospitals be embodied in the Bill. Conservative members have made that point and clearly support that view.<br><br>
As for ballots, I have served on a few Standing Committees since I became a Member of the House, and the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) served on the Standing Committee considering the Housing Act 1988. He talked with great enthusiasm of the need for ballots when local authority tenants were asked to opt out of local authority control. He argued against us about who should be involved in those ballots. The Government said that one could define who should be involved. Local authority tenants were allocated one vote per household, regardless of whether there was disagreement within the household. The Government decided that if someone died his or her vote should be counted as a yes vote.<br><br>
Similarly, on education, when there were arguments about who should vote in a ballott on whether a school should opt out, the Government were sure that they could define whether the parents, one parent or two parents should be involved. In arguments about future generations of children at a school linked to the school that was proposing to opt out, they were clear about whether parents should be involved. All sorts of anomalies could arise, but the Government were certain that the groups which should be involved in consultation and could take part in a ballott could be defined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. Can he tell which locality;s people should be ballotted: are they for Guy's, Bart's or even St Thomas's across the road?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We fall back on our amendment. We have proposed options for the groups to be consulted. Definition could clearly be more closely specified. The Government have argued that they would accept an amendment that referred to the staff in the hospital because they are a discreet group of people involved in the service of delivering health care to patients. That is much more clearly defined than reference to tenants,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
families of tenants, future generations and so on. In Manchester, 35,000 people are waiting for council accommodation. Would the hon. Gentleman involve them in an opt-out ballot? I am sure not, because he claims to be able to define those who will take part in a ballot.<br><br>
The amendment defines discreet groups, whether they be staff, the local community or consultants only. If the Government believe, as they have argued vehemently, that it is possible to define the electorate — as they did on housing and education legislation—there is no reason why they cannot support the electorate as we have defined it in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a scanner in Calderdale which the people of the two constituencies of Halifax and Calder Valley made great sacrifices to buy. Whatever may be thought of people going out with collecting boxes to assist in the purchase of vital National Health Service equipment, they did just that. I know the community whose members made those collections. I think that they should have a ballot on the question of whether the scanner becomes the property of a hospital trust. It is part and parcel of a contract, and there arises the question whether the private hospital in Calderdale will have first use of it because it will be able to pay the highest price. In such circumstances, the community has an absolute right to a vote on whether that expensive equipment will be used by the private sector. When the appeal was set up, a condition was that NHS patients, rather than private care patients used it on the basis of need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has advanced an excellent argument. I shall advance a similar one in due course.<br><br>
Christie hospital in my constituency is on the short list for opting out. It is well-known national and regional specialty hospital for cancer care. I shall speak briefly about it and another hospital which is trying hard to get on the short list to opt out—Stepping Hill in Stockport. The reason we are asking for consultation with defined groups on whether hospitals should opt out is that the way in which Christie hospital arrived on the short list makes us fearful about spurious statements from the Secretary of State about consultation.<br><br>
The fact that Christie hospital is on the short list has nothing to do with administration at any level, or democrats in the hospital, taking a view about whether the hospital should become a trust. There has been no discussion at the CHC or the DHA about whether it should become a self-managed hospital trust. The Government have siad that it is not relevant to consult because the Secretary of State will decide which hospitals are, in his opinion, viable for opting out. Having talked to staff at Christie hospital at all levels—nurses, doctors and ancillary or domestic staff—I know that the only reason they have given for opting out of the NHS is that they are starved of the resources required to deliver the care in which they believe. The only reason Christie hospital is on the list is that despite numerous representations to the Scretary of State and his Minister over the years about the under-funding of the South Manchester health authority, to which Christie hospital belongs, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
hospital isnable to deliver a range of facilities and care compatible with its position as a regional and national specialty hospital. The consultants, doctors, nurses and other staff are fed up with trying to meet those needs. They are tired of seeing cancer patients turned away because South Manchester health authority is underfunded.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
we have argued constantly for Christie hospital to be specially funded, but we want that special funding to be given within the NHS with democratic and local accountability for the hospital rather than the hospital opting out and into the ambit of private health care. Ultimately, that will happen, because it is the only way that it can deliver the required service. <i>[Interruption].</i> The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) laughs at my prophesy. Many Cheadle people who use Christie's facilities are applied at the possibility of the hospital being removed from local accountability. They will wreak great revenge on Tory Members who suport the removal of the hospital from local health care.<br><br>
I shall deal now with Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaops the hon. Gentleman will relate his comments more closely to the amendments rather than make a general speech on the nature of the trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Dame Janet.<br><br>
I was about to mention Stepping Hill hospital and balloting for health care. The hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) has made it clear that he wishes Stepping Hill hospital to be the first general hospital to opt out of NHS local control. He has said so many times. He is disappointed that it is not on the short list. Judging by his question in the House today, he believes that the reason for that is the incompetence -as he described it - of the health authority, which has not central services onto one side in Stockport to make the unit more suitable for opting out of the NHS.<br><br>
Having worked in the NHS in Stockport, I know that local people care deeply about the Health Service. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) said that the amount of money raised at Stepping Hill and Christie hospitals through voluntary contributions to fund essential services has run to many thousands of pounds. The Pat Seed centre in Christie hospital is a good example of thousands of pounds being given for facilities, extra equipment— and extra staff, in its case—to provide essential services. These people believe that they have the right to a say in whether the hospital should be removed from local control. In Stepping Hill's case, the feeling is similar.<br><br>
Would the hon. Member for Cheadle support the people of Cheadle and Stockport in a ballot on whether Stepping Hill hospital should opt out of local NHS control?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not be allowed to lay down the parameters of what I will or will not say. I rise to make a point that directly affects my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is running away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not running away. I was about to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
an important point on behalf of my constituents.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman clearly does not know when he is being amusing. I was not laughing at his remarks about Christie hospital: I was laughing at the constant references to privatisation proposals—a habit that he shares with many of his hon. Friends. I laughed because it is sad that many of my constituents have been constantly bemused and distracted by such accusations. I am amused when I hear someone who knows what the Bill is about, but denies its real content, continuing to repeat such ridiculous allegations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two simple points. First, I invite the hon. Gentleman to accompanying me to Christie hospital and meet the consultants who have said that the only way to make the hospital viable is to increase the number of private patients, and thereby prop up other services. If that is not the first step towards privatising health care, I do not know what is. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my invitation.<br><br>
Secondly, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will answer a question, and if he does not answer it, I can only assume that the answer is no. Does he accept that the people of Stockport and Cheadle have a right to vote on whether Stepping Hill hospital should opt out of local health service control?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked for it, and he will get it. The people in the area of Stockport and Stepping Hill obviously have an interest in what goes on at the local hospital, but that hospital is not used exclusively by the people who live in the immediate area, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) said, one cannot directly identify the people who would be balloted on such an issue.<br><br>
Secondly, I hope that I shall be permitted, Dame Janet, to take a little more of the Committee's time to answer the important question that relates to my constituency. If Stepping Hill hospital were to opt out of local DHA control, and if the hospital management believed that such a move would be to the advantage of my constituents, I would see nothing wrong in it. I accept that many local people would not accept that proposition at the moment, but that is not surprising when they have been told that the hospital is to leave the NHS. When the proposals are in place and the people of Stockport know the truth about them, the Labour party will get its comeuppance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind all hon. Members that interventions should be short.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From that intervention I can draw the conclusion that the hon. Member for Cheadle is prepared to let local people have a say, as long as he frames the question. On that basis, we can happily organise a ballot in Stockport, the hon. Gentleman can devise the question on behalf of local people, and we can put the matter to the test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will you also put out the leaflet that I have written?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My apologies, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Seated interventions are not welcome, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not noticed that seated interventions are the monopoly of one side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude my remarks. Despite the protestations of Conservative Members, we believe in local accountability for decisions. There was nothing in the speeches of Tory Members at the time of the general election to say that a Conservative Government would introduce these proposals to destroy the Health Service. The only way in which local people can have a say in the way that the Health Service meets their needs is to have a ballot. The ballot that we propose is wide ranging, and we have allowed the Government various options for ascertaining local views. The very least that they can do is to choose one of the amendments and use it to prove to themselves and to the public that they, too, believe in democracy and the rights of local people to determine the sort of health care that they want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on the amendments, not least because my hon. Friends have already exploded the myths that lie behind them. I look forward to voting against the amendments in due course. However, I should like to take up a point made on amendments Nos. 34 and 317 by the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe). The hon. Gentleman painted a caricature of the managerial system in the Health Service. We were led to believe that the managers were venal and self-seeking, and undermined the important points made about the Griffiths reforms. I served on Islington health authority shortly after those reforms were implemented—indeed, I was the only Conservative member of it, and it was a bracing experience—and I do not recognise the picture which the hon. Gentleman painted of those reforms or the devoted people who undertake the difficult work of management in the Health Service, which is at the heart of many of the reforms in the Bill. I shall intervene only briefly, to defend the managerial system and the individuals whom the hon. Member for Wakefield was attacking and undermining.<br><br>
They are an important part of these reforms and they do a difficult job. Although the hon. Gentleman may feel that they are highly paid, they could easily double or even quadruple their level of pay in the private sector, and it ill befits him to undermine them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen. McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My constituency has always been predominantly a mining area, and it paid for and built its original hospitals. The staff in those hospitals were proud to work in them, and when the National Health Service was formed, they were proud to move over to it. Therefore, the Minister's answers to my earlier questions came as surprise, as they will to my constituents. I asked him whether the people of Barnsley would continue with the services which they have now, and continue to move into Sheffield as they do now and whether the co-operation between Barnsley and Sheffield would continue. The Minister said no, emphatically no. I believe that my constituents should have a say in whether to continue with the service that they have, or have a service that means that they move from one area to another, which they clearly do not want.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0562">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
Many of the staff working in the general hospital now were at the old Beckett hospital, which was a miners' hospital and a general hospital, and I am certain that they do not want to move from the locality that they have served for many years. I think that they have the right to say whether they want the changes. Whatever Conservative Members may say, my constituents have shown in the views that they have put to me that they see this reform as the beginning of the end for the National Health Service, which has served this country for two generations. They also see it as a dilution of the service.<br><br>
All the talk about differentials in pay, incentives and movement from one area to another and one hospital to another worries me, because it will create not a two-tier service but a three-tier service—one which is private, and trust, and another. I think that the people have a right to decide before we go down that road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that we may be voting in the Chamber before long, but I want to discuss one or two matters and perhaps put to rights one or two of the outrageous remarks made by the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes). I hope that he will listen, as I would not want to criticise him when he is not listening.<br><br>
He made one glaring mistake about the Bill and what is contained in <i>Hansard.</i> The first lesson that a legal student is taught at college is that when a judge interprets a statute, he is told specifically that all he needs to see is the Bill or the Act, and that there is not need for him—</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.17 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Division in the House, I was reminding the Committe that a court would look only at the worlds contained in the act and the regulations. It would not take into account assurances reported in <i>Hansard,</i> which would not be worth the paper on which they were written. Therefore, we should prefer to listen not to the words of the hon. Member for Harlow, but to hear from Minister, when she winds up, whether there will be a consulation procedure for hospitals that seek trust status.<br><br>
During the past few months I have obtained a copy of the interesting speech given by the Secretary of State for Health at the Conservative party conference. It contains a profound statement, which I am sure received a resounding cheer. I cannot deliver it with the panache of the Secretary of State, but he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I want to prove that a giant service will work best when it gets used to the idea that the patient is kin."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will agree with that. Yet the patient is absent from the list of groups and organisations that can make an application for trust status. Paragraph 3.15 of the Government's White Paper states that such groups
<br><blockquote><p>"could include the District Health Authority (DHA), the hospital management team, a group of staff, or people from the local community who are active in the hospital's support."</p></blockquote>
It does not mention patients, yet the Secretary of State
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
stressed their needs at the Conservative party conference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that point. I have sat patiently through the debate to discover how the Opposition would enlighten me. I am in favour of ballots. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, and I have written a booklet called "Save our Schools", in which we advocate ballots for schools that want to opt-out. I do not understand how one could identify who should be balloted on NHS services and the Opposition have not enlightened me. Balloting the triangle of patients, staff and people who live in the community is more complex than balloting parents with children in schools that want to opt-out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should do me the courtesy of reading my amendment. Amendment No. 42 deals with that issue and suggests that the patients or potential patients of hospitals that seek trust status should be balloted. The amendment goes much further than other Opposition amendments. I am calling for the voice of the patient to be heard. I have listened carefully to all the contributions made by Conservative Members. I am puzzled by their resistance to the idea of ballots, because they were all in favour of ballots to enable housing to come out of local authority control. Conservatives also promoted ballots to enable schools to opt out of local authority control. But the Government did not get the results that they bargained for in those ballots. When people have been given the choice of retaining local authority control over housing, they have chosen overwhelmingly to stay with local authorities. In the only Welsh ballot on the proposal that schools should be able to opt out, people chose overwhelmingly to stay within the local authority system.<br><br>
Conservatives voted for those ballots because they thought that once the act was in place people would not be distracted by Opposition propaganda. However, virtually all the ballots have gone against the wishes of the Conservative party, which is why it is now against ballots. The Government are against a democratic right being exercised by people who disagree with their proposals.<br><br>
We can all punch holes in the way in which ballots are conducted. We can all find reasons why the proposed ballot should not be held, such as difficulties in defining constituencies. But that is similar to arguing that because the electoral register is 20 per cent. out of date due to deaths and population movements, we should not have an election until it is 100 per cent. correct. No one in his right mind would argue that. Conservative Members are against the ballot because they are sure that the result would go against them. When people are asked point blank whether they want the NHS to remain free at the point of delivery and as a statutory responsibility, they overwhelmingly say yes. They refute the argument that hospitals should become trusts.<br><br>
I accept the view expressed by people outside and no doubt inside the Committee that it is much easier to be against something than for it. When in opposition, it is always much easier to punch holes in an argument. We are not, however, debating a proposal that was thought up last week; the Government have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
had 18 months in which to persuade the public that they are right. But 18 months later the public are voting the other way.<br><br>
I believe that my proposal and proposals of other hon. Members will be defeated when put to a vote tonight. Conservative Members should understand, however, that if they vote against this set of amendments and thus deny patients the right to vote on the proposals, they will reap a great disaster for themselves. If people are denied the right to a ballot on NHS trusts, at the next general election they will tell Conservative Members what they think of their policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have placed much emphasis on the results of so-called elections that they have held. However, an important aspect is the image that is given to a poll and a subject apart from the merits or demerits of a question that is asked. I compliment Opposition Members on their success thus far—it has to be recognised—in the propaganda war to win hearts and minds, but that does not alter the central features of the Bill which, I am convinced, will benefit my constituents and the NHS general.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is too much noise. I can hardly hear the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Dame Janet. I am doing my best; I am almost shouting because of the noise.<br><br>
Opposition Members seem to have one motto, which the amendments exemplify, about reform of the NHS: stop it. They want to retain the NHS in a fossilised form. Yet they queue up to tell us the present difficulties of the very system that they wish to fossilise. Suppose that the Opposition's message were correct and that throwing money at the NHS were a solution to all its problems. As the Government are now spending 40 per cent, more in real terms and are spending more on the NHS than on defence, they should have solved its problems four times over. But that is not the case and Oppositions Members know that. Indeed, the founding fathers of the NHS said that it would never be so. It is a false premise for the Opposition to argue that lack of money is causing the problems of the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may repeat the question posed to the hon. Gentleman and ask for a direct answer? Is he in favour of Stepping Hill hospital opting out? Yes or no?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that would be in the interests of my constituents and of all those users of Stepping Hill hospital—the net goes far wider than my constituency —the answer is yes. As I represent it, any other answer would be stupid.<br><br>
It is sad that Labour Members found it necessary to attack my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) who is not present. I do not know my hon. Friend's views on the issue but he should not have been mentioned in the debate because he could not defend himself. <br><br>
10.30 pm<br><br>
Hon. Members are upset about the prospect of self-governing hospitals. I remind them that there is nothing radical in the proposal. The last self-governing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
hospitals in the NHS were abolished by the 1974 reforms. Those teaching hospitals resented having to relinquish their independent status and come under the control of the district health authority.<br><br>
The Opposition are distorting the arguments and misleading the public. There are myriad misleading leaflets in GPs' surgeries, although the Opposition have dropped many of their charges against the Bill and forgotten about them. The same will apply to the proposal for self-governing hospitals.<br><br>
In the short term, it may be politically useful for Opposition Members to use the proposal to attack the Government's committment to the NHS. But when the Bill is enacted and people realise that the proposals work, they will turn on those who made false accusations against the Government.<br><br>
I note that the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) is not listening to me. I shall vote for the Bill at every stage of its passage through Parliament, and my constituents will give me their vote of confidence in the proposals at the next election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not want a fossilised system for financing the NHS. Every hospital should, within its budget be able to veer between capital and revenue to raise alternative funds. We do not need the complicated bag of tricks in clause 5 to achieve the financial flexibility that should be part of the system. The mesh of cash limits on the NHS in the past 15 years—let us be honest about it—has led to this confusion.<br><br>
I hope that the procedures for consultation will be set out and that they will encompass the proposal in amendment No. 35 then consult all the doctors working in a hospital. Their judgment and commitment is vital to the success of the enterprise.<br><br>
If the Minister believes in what she is doing she will accept the spirit, if not the letter, of amendment No. 35 and include it in her proposals.<br><br>
I shall bring one detailed local matter to the Minister's attention because it is relevant to consultation. In the North Tyneside health authority area every consultant has not simply voted in a ballot but recorded at a meeting his wish for the health authority not opt out as a district. When there are whole district opt-outs, and entirely new set of complications for consultation and difficulties for the managers involved arises.<br><br>
Members of the North Tyneside district health authority have been pressing the district general manager who is sponsoring the whole district opt-out scheme, to clarify his interest. He is riding both purchaser and the provider horses. He is drawing up the business plan to be submitted to the Secretary of State for whole district opt-out and at the same time preparing plans for all purchasing requirements, many of which I admit, not all will lie with that authority.<br><br>
At the health authority's last meeting a handwritten photocopied piece of paper was handed out. It was headed "Sylvia", the name of the district health authority's chair, and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"For your information, Geoff Nicholl and I"</p></blockquote>
the two senior managers involved—
<br><blockquote><p>"saw Douglas Hague"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0564">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
the regional general manager for the Northern regional health authority—
<br><blockquote><p>"yesterday to discuss our positions as Trust Project Managers and we came to the following agreement:-"</p></blockquote>
The nature of that agreement was then set out. I do not consider that adequate or reputable. I note particularly that the paper contained the term "for your information" and that there was no suggestion that members of the district health authority as a collective entity had any rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman because this has nothing to do with him, but again there is a buzz of conversation. I know it is not easy, after spending many hours in the Committee, but Members must exercise more self-control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel like Jean Brodie, cut down in my prime.<br><br>
The paper, or document, strikes at the heart of many proposals although I realise that many opt-out proposals are not for whole districts. We must have early clarification if the credentials of staff, district health authorities and workers in the Health Service are to be challenged by removing their rights to take part in ballots or legitimise and authenticate proposals for opt-out plans. If that is the proposal, it is not adequate, either.<br><br>
The fundamental conflict of interests for the district manager who is preparing purchasing plans, sponsoring a whole district opt-out proposal and preparing the business plan for the opted-out hospital, is unacceptable.<br><br>
I hope that at an early date the Minister will clarify and make public how such conflicts of interests will be worked out. A district general manager cannot ride both purchasing and providing horses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome back the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) who was absent for much of the debate that he started. I shall also comment on the speeches by the hon. Members for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) and for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay).<br><br>
The hon. Member for Withington talked about the Government destroying the Health Service and the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone spoke of the end of the NHS. The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) went one better and said that in every important aspect NHS trusts would be identical to private hospitals, with which they would compete. The Opposition use the big lie technique: "If you say it often enough, people will believe you. People will believe that the NHS is being destroyed and that NHS trusts are private hospitals." Yet, clauses 5 to 10 provide that they will be an integral part of the NHS, and accountable to the Secretary of State. The words "Secretary of State" appear in almost every clause. NHS trusts will not be independent or private, but they will not be controlled by DHAs. They will receive Government money and employ NHS staff. The Opposition have talked nonsense this evening. When the NHS hospital trusts have been set up and the NHS reforms are in place, the public will ask why the Opposition lied. That happened when the Transport Act 1981 was implemented.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given the hon. Member considerable latitude. He must address himself to the amendments, which have scareley been mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments to clause 5 deal with ballots on NHS trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is impossible to debate ballots if the Committee has not discussed NHS trusts. The Opposition have misrepresented the Government's views often. The public have realised that and voted time and again for the Government in general elections. It is important to understand why the Labour party proposes holding ballots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must address himself to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My last word was "ballots", Dame Janet. The Labour party's technique was exposed in a document that was circulated among my hon. Friends two weeks ago that was designed to postpone the implementation of the Bill. The Labour party opposes reforms because its members hate diversity, flexibility and choice. The want DHAs to have a monopoly on health provision. Clause 5 provides for a middle way between the independent sector and the DHA NHS trusts that are state-funded and accountable to the Secretary of State. The Government should not accept proposals for ballots. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) said, patients are transitory. People are patients for two or three weeks until they are cured. National Health Service provision should be for the whole community, not only those who are patients at the time of a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some hospitals are being put forward for trust arrangements whose patients all live within the district. What is the hon. Gentleman's response to ballots in those hospitals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. No general hospital or health district accepts only patients within its own district. In my constituency in rural west Wales patients move between Carmarthen, Swansea and London. Are they to vote in ballots on St. Thomas's hospital, Guy's hospital and St. Bartholomew's hospital or merely on the Pembrokeshire health authority? That is the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchcliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not refer to a district general hospital. I was speaking about a hospital that wants to opt out and become a trust, even though it is used entirely by the district in which it is based. What is the hon. Gentleman's objection to a ballot of those living in the district who now have the sole use of that hospital?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. It does not work like that. The Withybush hospital in the Pembrokeshire district health authority is used by those outside that area. It is impossible to define a constituency that would deal only with those who use that specific hospital, and no other.</span></p>
<p>10.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the argument closely.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0565">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
Can the hon. Gentleman explain the sentence in paragraph 3.8 of Self-governing Hospitals working paper 1 which reads;
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Trust has contracts with more than one DHS, visitation rights should be vested in the CHC for the District where the hospital is located."</p></blockquote>
That means that all other community health councils should be excluded from visitation rights. Surely that suggests that the Goverment have identified health trusts as belonging to particular areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It suggests that CHCs in other districts would have had an interest but, to make it administratively possible, the Government have decided that only one CHC will have the visitation rights. It is strange that the hon. Gentleman does not understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hinchcliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to pursue this argument. The hon. Gentleman had dodged answering my specific question, so I shall put it another way. In my area, it has been suggested that community services should be opted out. At present, all those who receive those community services live within the district. What is the hon. Gentleman's objection to a ballot of those people? No one outside the area would be able to take part; it would be directed only to those who will be affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should have more confidence in the Secretary of State. If the situation is as the hon. Gentleman has outlined, the Secretary of State will make the right decision.<br><br>
I do not believe in the expense of holding a ballot on what is inevitably a technical matter involving personnel, management and staffing. It is not possible to phrase questions for a simple ballot that requires the answer yes or no. That is why ballots are not the best procedure.<br><br>
Finally, if hospitals were leaving the NHS there would be a good argument for ballots, but we are not talking about that. We are discussing a change in the management structure and hospitals that are being transferred from the control of DHAs within the NHS to direct accountability to the Secretary of State. They will still be part of the NHS. A ballot on the change in the management structure is not practical because questions could not be phrased simply enough to make it intelligible and require a yes or no answer. Moreover, the constituency could not be correctly defined and, it would make no sense if the fundamental structure of the NHS is not being changed. The hospitals are not leaving the NHS; they will still be an integral part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) had to leave. We understand that he had to go the television studio. Had he been able to stay for the rest of the debate, I think that he would have been impressed, as I have been, by the strength of feeling shown by Government supporters. My hon. Friends the Members for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson), for Cheadle (Mr. Day), for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) and for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) have all spoken robustly about the great
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
importance of NHS trusts in health care. The trusts offer an opportunity to provide flexible care. They will enable managers to have the discretion that they want, as well as greater control over resources, investment, and the development of services.<br><br>
Many of those who complain about the Health Service mention the frustrations, the bureaucracy and the monolithic nature of the controls. National Health Service trusts offer units the opportunity to govern their affairs, develop their services and exploit to the full the talents of those who work with and for them. The trusts provide care in situations where, to use the phrase of the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones), the patient is king. We believe strongly that NHS trusts will be a force for good. The scheme will establish centres of excellence, which will be an example for other parts of the Health Service.<br><br>
Opposition Members have spoken about whether this is a legitimate subject for a ballot. We believe strongly that it is not. The subject is complex and detailed. Once the Health Service trusts can make formal applications after the Bill's enactment, they will produce a prospectus document. The document will deal with the overall aims of the trusts, their progress in arranging contracts, the way in which they will develop their services, the quality that will be assured, their leadership and management arrangements, personnel issues, information systems, finance and estates. A simple ballot of a few words could not do justice to the complexity and importance of such a decision.<br><br>
We believe that there should be consulation. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said that the initial document made it clear that the RHAs should give local publicity to all proposals to seek self-governing status. The views of those interested will be sought, especially the health authorities concerned, hospital staff, general practioners, CHCs and the local community. People will be asked to submit their responses, together with any comments, my right hon. and lady Friend the Secretary of State for Health.<br><br>
The document entitled "Self-Governing Hospitals -an Initial Guide" makes it clear that once an application has been prepared, the RHA will again seek the views of health authorities, hospital staff, general practitioners CHCs and the local community. Each application will be subjected to careful consultation, given the complicated service, management and financial implications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister explain how the RHA will consult the local community?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'> I have spelt that out clearly on two occasions using two of the major documents about NHS trusts.<br><br>
We do not intend being too prescriptive. It will be important to have a flexible method of consultation in differing circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has quoted from the section on consultation to which I referred. How valid will such consultation be? If the local CHC health council, the district health authority and all bodies consulted say that they do not want to opt out, can we presume that the Minister will refuse the application?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that towards the end of my remarks because it is important in terms of the viability of NHS trusts and the work that they will be able to do within the community. We have made it clear that we shall be bringing forward guidance for RHAs on the question of consultation, but we do not believe that any of the specific examples given are remotely appropriate.<br><br>
The NHS is a managed, complex and enormously costly service in which the Government have invested extremely heavily. We have seen increasing patient care with a greater number of patients treated to a higher standard over the past years.<br><br>
However, the crucial point - one which, in a sense, answers the hon. Gentleman's question - is that for the NHS trusts to be successful it is important to work with the staff, with those who serve the hospital and with the local community. My right hon. and lady Friend the Secretary of State will have regard to those factors when making a decision on a NHS trust.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) listed the people whom he hoped would be consulted and taken into account. I assure him that all those people will certainly be considered in the consultation undertaken by the RHA. That is fundamental in ensuring an effective and efficient service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are listening to the Minister with care. By "we" I do not mean the prime ministerial "we"; I mean the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs Mahon) and myself. Will the Minister define the difference between those groups who will be considered in consultations and those groups who will be consulted? It strikes me that the two forms of wording do not have quite the same meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We make it clear that the RHA will be required to publicise the proposals for an NHS trust and it will take the views of all those with an interest. The fundamental criteria that my right hon. and lady Friend the Secretary of State will consider when he is deciding whether to make an order is whether there is strong and effective leadership and personnel management and the extent to which senior professional staff are involved in the management of the hospitals. It is clear throughout our proposals that we look to have NHS trusts where there is a measure of co-operation and agreement and an ability to work together. When the NHS trust is accepting contracts, relations with the local community and the local DHA will, of course be extremely important, and there are several areas where collaboration and a spirit of good will are of great significance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. David Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not consultation exactly this: seeking to achieve co-operation and to relate a matter to a local community, explaining, meeting fears and taking on board arguments and detail but not giving any group the right of veto?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We shall, of course, listen with care and thoroughness to all the interest groups but no one group will have the automatic right of veto. That is the crucial point that needs to be made.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
Savours) spoke about the motivation of the trust directors and the profit motive and compared the proposals with the model in the United States. I must make it clear to him that our NHS bears little resemblance to the provision of health care in the United States.<br><br>
At this time of the evening, it is time for a confession. The hon. Member for Workington has an advantage over me because earlier in his life he had experience in the private sector. I believe that he was involved in manufacturing clocks. He speaks of the private sector with venom, suspicion and mistrust —</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From experience.</span></p>
<p>11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be from experience my career history is different. I have always worked in the public sector, and I am only too aware of its shortcomings and difficulties. We have some of the best public services in the world, but management training and the effective use of resources are important. Opposition Members should read an article that was written in 1984 by Peter Kellner, which emphasised how important it was for the Labour party to understand the significance of market mechanisms. Those mechanisms introduce a cost element into welfare service provision and recognise the role of the consumer - the patient. We want to redress the balance and create the services that most meet the needs of patients. The NHS trusts will be able to develop as centres of excellence that will be examples to others. I deplore the cynical and negative response of many Opposition Members. The comments of the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) about NHS managers were especially distressing. The Government have been committed to improving the quality of NHS managers. Excellent progress has been made by appointing managers who have great commitment to their role and by increasing the collaboration and co-operation between managers and other NHS professionals.<br><br>
We believe that the NHS trusts will be a force for good and—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is entitled to be heard in courteous silence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. National Health Service trusts have a vital contribution to make. Consultation is important, but ballots are not the way forward. The Bill will establish NHS trusts that will provide high-quality health care and a rewarding environment for their staff and to their communitities. The amendments should be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it was important to provide a role for patients, but she appeared to envisage that role as being one of being moved, around when there are commercial problems within the market mechanism. Amendment No. 33 gives patients a role by allowing them to decide what happens to the hospitals that they use. The Minister's view of the patients' role does not include allowing them to decide what happens to their local health service.<br><br>
I am encouraged that the Minister said that the RHAs will take the view of the communities that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
serve about the proposals. That statement did not have the ringing affirmation and assurance of consultation that the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) had led us to believe was in the Ministers' mind. How will the RHAs take the view of the community? They will not do it by giving communities a vote, by asking the opinions of staff or by balloting consultants. All those consultation methods have been ruled out by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? </span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but I am conscious that we have only until 11.45 pm before we are interrupted again by a Division in the House. It would be convenient to the Committee if we moved along as swiftly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 33 draws attention to
<br><blockquote><p>"the district in which the hospital or other establishment or facility is situated".</p></blockquote>
Will the hon. Gentleman think about Stracathro hospital, which I am sure he knows well, and consider how he intends to consult people in Aberdeen, Perth, Dundee and the other areas from which that hospital receives patients, and whether it is viable to do what?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not familiar with the particular circumstances of that hospital. It is in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and if he does not know whom that hospital consults, it is not for me to assist him. I can guide him with the example of the hospital that I know best which is the one that treats my constituents. The West Lothian district general hospital's catchment area can be reading well defined. It serves a catchment area that is contiguous with the constituencies of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and coincides with one single district council. There would not be the slightest problem in defining the electorate. Local authority officials are well versed in giving the electorate the opportunity to vote.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms Harman) knows hospitals in London well and said that is is perfectly possible to establish a catchment area that coincides with hospitals. I know that you will not express a view on the matter, Dame Janet, but I am sure that in the heart of Plymouth there is an echo of what I am about to say. The rest of country is fed up to the back teeth of being told that they cannot have certain provisions in legislation because they would not suit London. It would suit vast areas of the provinces to have a ballot on what happens to their general hospitals and it would be perfectly reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way on this occasion, and then we must make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's much vaunted enthusiasm for ballots, will he tell us why, when the Labour Government nationalised hospitals in 1948, they did not ballot patients about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because we fought a general in 1945 setting out our policies in our manifestor and we were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
elected on a landslide. We had the mandate to do that. The hon. Gentleman knows that during the 1987 general election campaign he did not breathe a word of what he is voting for in this Committe party manifesto. The Government's behaviour in ramming the proposal through the House and refusing constituents any consultation period is a travesty of democracy and a shame upon the constitution. If the hon. Gentleman cannot work that out for himself, he should go to the other Committee where he spends the rest of this time.<br><br>
Having said that, Dame Janet, one of the most entertaining, uplifting and encouraging aspects of this debate is the miraculous powers with which my hon. Friends and I are credited for massaging public opinion. Having heard speeches about the way in which we have manipulated public opinion and achieved colossal ballot results, I am left wondering why we have spent the past 10 years in Opposition. Some of the Conservative Member's arguments over the past four hours would have done credit to those who opposed the Reform Act 1832. Conservative Members think that we cannot trust people to come to a ballot and that they might get hold of the wrong leaflets and be misled. The Minister of State produced a gem when she said that we cannot reduce complex decisions about the economy, defence and trade to a single decision between parties standing in elections. That argument has littered British history over the past 200 years. But we must trust people to make decisions about what they want and to make the right decision in the cut and thrust of public debate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) to say that people in her constituency had raised the money for a body scanner. They are perfectly entitled to say what happens to that body scanner, but I have to tell my hon. Friend that the situation is worse even than she suspects. As a result of the Bill and the working papers that accompany it, that hospital, should it opt out, will be obliged to reflect the initial cost of buyin that scanner in the price of the contracts charged to the district health authority that provides for the health care of the people who paid for the scanner. It is madness that such people are entitled to have the predominant view of what happens to their hospital.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) described successive promises that the Secretary of State would consult various groups, such as district health authorities, community health councils and consultants. They are all recorded in <i>Hansard</i>. The hon. Member for Harlow referred a flotilla of civil servants waiting to find and furnish us with the appropriate references. Having listened to the Minister's speech, that flotilla of civil servants does not appear to have sailed. We did not hear one reference to the many promises, which are told we slumbered through. If the Secretary of State is committed to that panoply of consultation, why are we arguing about including it in the Bill? Why can we not agree on the amendment, which would enshrine those commitments in the Bill?<br><br>
The hon Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0568">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
Kennedy) has tabled an amendment to require consultation with health councils. We would be happy to support the hon. Gentleman if he pressed the amendment to a division. Doubtless, the hon. Member for Harlow will support the amendment because, as he told the Committee, it would avoid doubt about the Secretary of State's commitment, which it would then be in black and white. Where is the Secretary of State's consultation? He has made much publicity of the 70-odd hospitals that have expressed an interest in forming an NHS trust. It is bogus to say that they will consult when applications are made because the application is already in and discussions and negotiations are already taking place. Hospital staff are working full-time on the proposal to form an NHS trust. There is no consultation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Withington said, the application is being conducted in secrecy, behind closed doors.<br><br>
The Minister said that we should proceed in a spirit of good will. The consultants at Guy's were so fed up with their management's spirit of ill will and the fixed results of management surveys that they called in the Electoral Reform Society to conduct an independent ballot. When we asked the previous Minister of State to tell Parliament who had expressed interest on behalf of those hospitals, he refused to tell us who had nominated the hospitals. I wrote to every district manager about the proposal that they should form an NHS trust. I received a rather tart letter from some of them saying that they did not know, and that I should speak to those hospitals that had expressed an interest. That is not open consultation nor is it a public debate. It is clearly a private attempt to make the minimum credible case that the hospital, as an abstract unit, has expressed an interest and to ensure that the decision is made in maximum secrecy.<br><br>
Much the most revealing and helpful observation in the debate came from the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Bay). At the end of his speech, he said that the one objective of the amendments was to stop the Bill. The only way in which the amendments could stop clause 5 from taking effect was if all those who had the right to ballot chose to exercise their right to stop the clause taking effect in their area. As the hon. Member for Cheadle well knows, the amendments will stop the clause taking effect only because Conservative Members know that they could not win a ballot. Because they cannot win, they want to stop democracy.<br><br>
