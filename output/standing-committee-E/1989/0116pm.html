<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. This morning, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) referred to the chairman of the Ealing health authority, Mrs. Diana Eccles. I have since had the chance to speak to members of the Ealing health authority, including my sister, who is a local councillor serving with Diana Eccles. My information should be put on record because it contradicts some things that were said by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, who is unfortunately not in his place this afternoon.<br><br>
Far from being accepted by both sides of the health authority, Mrs. Eccles' chairpersonship has been severely criticised by both Labour and Conservative members. As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) mentioned, Mrs. Eccles has no connection with Ealing. She lives in Yorkshire and Westminster and is as director of Yorkshire Television. She was a member of the Widdicombe inquiry into local government which led to the Local Government Act 1987.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0438">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
Pertinent to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is the fact that when Mrs. Eccles was chair of the health authority, the unit general manager, Mr. Tom McLuskey, who is manager of St. Bernard's, the mental health hospital, was found to be transferring patients from the health authority hospitals to his private nursing home. Clearly a conflict of interest arose as a result of that.<br><br>
The hon. Member the Member for Ealing, Acton also said that members of the health authority were happy with the way in which Diana Eccles was conducting its business. My informattion suggests that she has reduced the number of times that the health authority meets. It meets every other month, and in the second month members of the health authority take part in a seminar. A motion was passed by Ealing health authority opposing the proposals in the White Paper. As she is connected with the Government through her membership of various committees Mrs. Eccles refused to allow the motion, criticising the White paper and the Government's health policy to be debated in public.<br><br>
Finally, I refer to a letter dated 3 April 1988 and written to the <i>Ealing Gazette</i> by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton in which the—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are on a point of order, and I am trying desperately to find out what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of order is simple: it is that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton gave information to the Committee this morning on the basis of which hon. Members voted in a Division. I am drawing to the Committee's attention the fact that some of the information was inaccurate and misleading.</span></p>
<p><i>Several Hon. Members rose—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. What the hon. Gentleman says is not a matter for the Chair. What affects the voting behaviour of members of the Committee is a matter for them. May we continue with what we are supposed to be debating which is amendment No. 197?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Did the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) give my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) notice that he would raise the matter this afternoon?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that question impossible to answer, because I am not telepathic. It is a matter for the hon. Members involved. We should return to the debate, which might benefit the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This morning my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms.Harman) outlined her worries about the possible lack of consultation and representation of women on what will be the new family practitioner committees. My hon. Friend was taken to task by Conservative Ministers who dismissed her argument as irrelevant, although they did not put forward any counter argument.<br><br>
I shall give the Committee an example of how wrong representation can lead to drastic—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should appreciate the opportunity to listen to the hon. Lady's argument. The sartorial elegance or otherwise of members of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
Committee is not a matter for our consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It would be most helpful to hon. Members in the nether regions of the Committee Room if the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) would speak up. I appreciate that she is doing her best against background noise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Member sits where he chooses. I remind hon. Members that they must address the Chair, and if they sit so far down the Room that they cannot hear an hon. Member speak it is their problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My local district health authority is facing a financial deficit for 1990–91 of over 1 million. Yet again it has had to propose cuts. A £500,000 package is being considered over the next few weeks.<br><br>
One of the proposals is to close the children's ward of the Royal Halifax infirmary; in fact it was closed on Christmas Eve. I have received representations from constituents who are upset that their children were moved to adult wards on Christmas Eve—a distressing experience. It is proposed that the overflow of children from the remaining ward will be boarded in an adult ward for up to 15 per cent. of the time. The ward proposed is the gynaecology ward of the Halifax General hospital.<br><br>
I have found it difficult to express my feelings of outrage at the insensitivity of the proposal, not only because I thought that we had gone past the time when children and adults were mixed but because it is incredible that children, and perhaps young babies, should be put in a gynaecology ward, where women could be recovering from emotional illnesses and treatments involving children, including abortions, or sterilisations.<br><br>
I do not believe that that decision would have been reached had the architects of it come from a more suitable background in the National Health Service. The main architects were the general manager of the Calderdale health authority, who is an ex-manager from British Steel and a man, and the chairman, who is an insurance broker. That vindicates our arguments. I hope that the Minister notes that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the hon. Lady's account of cuts in the Health Service in her constituency. She would have been more gracious, and would have given a better sense of proportion to the subject, if she had added that in her constituency, Halifax, a new district general hospital has just been approved, costing £21 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind talking about the new district general hospital, because I have been talking about it for 20 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we shall not talk about it on this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall believe in the hospital when I see it. We were due to have a new laundry, but the Minister changed his mind after the 1983 general election. I am a little sceptical about any of the Government's promises of new hospitals. We have faced ward closures and cuts over the past 10 years, and later on I shall be happy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
to give the hon. Gentleman details of the massive loss of beds and ward closures that we have suffered in Calderdale. I ask the Minister to consider my example, and to tell the general manager and the chairman of the district that it is not appropriate to mix children and gynaecology patients.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:
The debate has been dominated by hon. Members from both sides of the Committee recognising the importance of the family practitioner services. Indeed, those services are one of the greatest strengths of the National Health Service. Recently, the Government have sought to enhance their role in the White Papers entitled 'Promoting Better Health' and 'Working for Patients'. Those White Papers make it clear that we want to develop the responsibilities of the family practitioner services and to encourage them to plan, assess and manage the extremely costly services for which they are responsible. The amendments specify the qualities that we want to see in members of family health service authorities. The issue has been well debated. We want individuals of distinction and experience who have skills that can improve and maintain effective, high-quality primary health care services.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) suggested that the proposals were a vote of no confidence in the family practitioner committees. Nothing could be further from the truth. We want to build, develop and refine all that we have learnt, and ensure that family health service authorities are well-equipped to provide their important services.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have suggested that members of an authority should live or work in the area. Local people will have a strong interest in the provision of local services. Many members of the authorities will live or work within the area. The issue that is being debated, however, is whether that should be a criterion for their appointment. Local knowledge is extremely important but we do not want to be unduly prescriptive and require that members of the authority live or work in the area when they may have worked there all their lives and moved away recently. They may have been involved in a voluntary organisation in the vicinity, but be excluded by the requirement that they live and work there.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members will feel reassured that we appreciate and understand that local knowledge is an important factor, but we do not want unduly to tie the hands of those making the appointments. We want high-quality, effective, skilled people who will ensure that the billions of pounds that are spent on the family practitioners service are spent effectively in the interests of patients.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye spoke about the significance of continuity. In "Working for Patients" we made it clear that we would ensure that the new lay membership would preserve a measure of continuity with the family practitioner committees, as currently constituted. I hope that that will reassure those who are concerned about what could otherwise mean substantial changes for groups who are already taking on a number of important new responsibilities.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
We do not take the view that it is appropriate for ear-marked places to be kept for members of local authorities. Nevertheless many local authority members who served with distinction will no doubt continue to be appointed to the new authorities. They are not debarred. We merely wish to bring an end to the representative nature of the existing relationship.<br><br>
Similarly, community health council will continue to play an extremely important part in representing local views. They will still be required to hold annual meetings with the family health services authorities, and they will still be able to attend the public sessions of the FHSA meetings.<br><br>
I come now to the subject that seems to have exercised the minds of many members of the Committee-one on which I, too, hold strong views. It is the dilemma of whether it is possible to ensure that particular groups receive services of the quality that we would all wish by stipulating that certain percentages of those groups are represented on the authority. Conservative Members refute that notion. We do not believe that only a disabled person can ensure that services for the disabled are to a high standard, that only a woman can ensure that services for women are to a high standard, that only someone from an ethnic minority can ensure that services for ethnic minorities are to the right standard.<br><br>
My hon. Friends made the matter clear in our debate on clause 1. Whether one comes from an ethnic majority, whether one is part of the majority and a woman, or whether one is disabled, what one wants is high-quality, effective and reliable services. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) referred in mocking tones to people with experience in the Army and to one individual, in particular, who said that he derived great satisfaction from meeting deadlines, as though it were a subject of great mirth. In my view, to involve anyone in health care who takes great satisfaction in meeting deadlines cannot be other than a major advantage. What most people want, irrrespective of whether they are pushing a double buggy into the local GP clinic, is clean, efficient and effective services for which they do not have to wait unduly, and information that is readily available. Once the new GP contract is in place, there will be a great improvement in many of the services. By having information available about family practitioner services, by making GPs advertise their times, and by generally enhancing the role of parents in the family practitioner services—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, I wholly accept her argument, but it may reassure Opposition Members if she can confirm that both the number of general practitioners from the ethnic minorities and the number of general practitioners who are women have increased substantially in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that. About half of medical undergraduates are female. I recently announced an increase in the number of hospital doctors and there was a dramatic increase in females taking senior positions. Thirty-five per cent. of family practitioner committee members are women and 25 per cent. of FPC chairmen are women.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister. Is she saying that there is no need for black and Asian people, women and the disabled to serve on the committees? If all that concerns her is standards, surely she will concede the need for those people to be represented and accept that the Secretary of State's legislative proposals must allow for appropriate representation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have made it clear that we wish to encourage any group to feel that it has a part to play in the family health service authorities. In particular, our guidance on appointments stresses the desirability of encouraging women and ethnic minorities to come forward. This is different from saying that they be appointed on the basis of that attribute. I bitterly dispute any such suggestion. We welcome those who serve and make an important contribution, but the key to providing service is going out and assessing and monitoring the needs of the various groups. I am pleased to say that recently we issued guidance to FPCs on the importance of consumer surveying to assess consumer satisfaction and wishes. That is the way forward. Similarly, we recently issued a circular setting up the medical audit advisory group. That again is a way of achieving high-quality health care.</span></p>
<p>I can—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. My admonition about trying to keep conservations quiet applies equally to both sides of the Committee. I should appreciate being allowed to listen to the Minister without interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
I can meet the concerns of the hon. Member for Peckham about quality. It is the key to health care provision and we are united in our determination to achieve high-quality services.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye spoke of the importance of the complaints procedures. I pay tribute to the services committees of the FPC for their work in investigating complaints. We envisage that work continuing under the new family health services authorities. They ensure a fair system for both patients and practitioners.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Peckham asked a number of questions about the complaints procedure. We are already taking steps to enable patients to complain orally if they have literacy difficulties. We are also extending the time limit within which complaints can be brought. The new authorities will be able to deal with less serious complaints through informal procedures instead of the more formal present arrangements.<br><br>
Mr hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) and the hon. Member for Ynys M6n (Mr. Jones) spoke about the nature of the medical representation. My hon. Friend raised similar points when we discussed district health authorities under clause 1.<br><br>
We made it clear in "Working for Patients" that we anticipate that the new authorities will consist of four professional members-a general medical practitioner, a general dental practitioner, a community pharmacist and a nurse with community experience. I give a clear assurance that we shall provide in regulations for these members. As with lay members, professional members will be appointed in a personal capacity, not as a sole
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
Source of professional advice to their authority. We expect the family health service authorities to secure proper professional advice from a variety of sources. With the advances in and sophistication of health needs, it may be naive to think that one or two medical practitioners on a family health services authority could provide the full range of necessary professional advice. We shall be looking to these authorities to ensure that there is a range of medical and other professional advice. It would not be possible to reflect that in the membership without turning these bodies into a kaleidoscope of the varied representative interests that we want taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Mon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister assuring us that regulations will include a specific commitment that the professional organisations that represent, say, the medical profession, will be allowed to appoint to the authority, or does she intend there to be consultation with them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that regulations will specify the nature of the four professional members of the family health services authority. As to a particular group of professionals having nomination rights, I give no such undertaking. No doubt the local medical committee and others will put forward names, but these appointments will be a matter for the regional health authorities under the new regime. They will gather names from a number of sources: for instance, from the faculties of the Royal College of General Practitioners, or the university departments of general practice. What is important is a clear assurance that the professional view will still be part of the family health services authorities but, like all members, professionals will be appointed on an individual basis because of their professional skill and not in their representative capacity.<br><br>
I hope that I have been able to satisfy the Committee that we are determined that the FHSAs will have the necessary expertise to be of the size to allow for effective decisions to be taken to ensure, above all, that the many patients, including ourselves, who are the beneficiaries of these essential family practitioner primary health care services continue to have their needs met, and to an ever higher standard.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 22, line 34, leave out from 'of to 'any' in line 35 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'31st July 1992'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 139, in page 22, line 35, after 'appointed', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'by an order subject to approval by a Resolution of the House of Commons'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first Scottish debate on the structure of the Health Service in Scotland. For the benefit of English and Welsh Members perhaps I should say a brief word about the differences between the two systems to enable hon. Members to follow the debate with a little more understanding than they would do otherwise.<br><br>
It is worth pointing out that whereas the English part of the Bill stands on its own, The Scottish part amends previous legislation and, in particular, The National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. I am grateful to the Minister for assuring me that copies of the 1978 Act will be available this evening.<br><br>
The second major difference is that Scotland has a single-tier structure of health administration. There are 15 health boards covering Scotland in that structure which are responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland. They are all appointed. Unlike the English health authorites at both regional and district levels, no appointments are made from local authorities and no people are appointed by anyone else. They are all directly appointed by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will tell me at some time during our debates that people and organisations are entitled to nominate people to the health boards before the Secretary of State makes his final decision)—I am sorry that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health has disappeared. It is worth pointing out that under statute, the Secretary of State is obliged to consult a range of organisations before he appoints anyone to the health boards. It is in their favour, if not much so, that the Secretary of State for Scotland and his junior Minister do not propose to do away with that consultation in the new arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If for ideological reasons there was a division of opinion on nominations between the junior Minister responsible for health and the Secretary of State, could my hon. Friend advise me what might happen?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a question that I find easy to answer. The evidence on other issues over the past months is that the junior Minister is the powerful figure in the Scottish Office as opposed to the Secretary of State, who these days, appears to be very much the Prime Minister's lackey. The right hon. Lady's mouthpiece in Scotland is the Under-Secretary of State with responsibilities for health. The hon. Gentleman is also chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland. He was appointed, not elected as might happen in other parties, directly by the Prime Minister against, according to every source that I know, the wishes of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who did not wish him to take the role.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Genetleman will not pursue that line. The amendment is not about the internal machinations of the Tory party in Scotland or elsewhere. I invite the hon. Gentleman to return to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. McWilliam, for allowing my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) to divert me down that road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recognise that you, Mr. McWilliam, made an important point that is significant to the Bill in so far as we know that many of the nominations would be made by the Scottish Conservative party. Its internal machinations must, therefore, have a bearing on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. I shall return to it and to the Minister's ideological position.<br><br>
I am sure that Conservative Members realise why the amendment refers to 31 July 1992. I estimate that 15 or 16 July is the last date on which the next general election can be held, if it has not been held before, and the amendment would prevent the implementation of this part of the Bill before that election. I may not be permitted to debate them, but I shall table similar amendments to delay the implementation of the whole Bill in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed. I thought that the hon. Gentleman had chosen the date because it marked the completion of legislation on the Common Market. That would provide us with a wider range of possibilities for striking the kind of contract—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will not follow the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) in pursuing that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. McWilliam, that I do not intend to do so. The hon. Gentleman understands the amendment's intention.<br><br>
There are three reasons why the Bill should not be implemented in Scotland until after the next general election, and one reason why it should be delayed even longer. First, the Government have no mandate to implement the Bill in Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) said earlier that they have no such mandate in the United Kingdom. The reforms of the National Health Service were not in the Tory manifesto for the June 1987 general election. The British people did not have the opportunity to vote on the changes. The evidence— the outcry, opinion polls and so on—shows that the British people may not have voted for the Government if they had known of the proposals. The legislation has been rejected by the professions and by the public. It is difficult to find anyone, apart from Ministers and Back Benchers, who supports it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. The amendments relate to appointments to health boards. Is he criticising the system in Scotland whereby appointments to health boards are made by the Secretary of State? Does he suggest that there is no mandate for that? The system
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
of which he is so critical was introduced by a Labour Government and canvassed in a Green Paper by the Labour party in 1968. There are no proposals to change that system; I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman talks about a mandate for a matter related to appointments to health boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may not have heard what I said earlier. His ideological hang-ups make it difficult for him to listen to anyone unless he agrees with what they say. I made it clear that I was using the general proposals for the NHS as a tag for this debate because I propose to table similar amendments throughout the Bill to try to delay its implementation. The people of Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom did not ask for the Bill. This is my first opportunity to speak of the subject and I am entitled to take it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend said was absolutely right. The Scottish people did not vote for the right of the chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland to make nominations to health boards, and we all know it. If I am mistaken, perhaps the Minister will show me where it appears in the campaign handbook.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Minister's power goes beyond that introduced in 1978 and 1968. He will have the power to sack all health board members and to appoint different people to those boards. That is what we object to.<br><br>
The Government have no madate for these proposals in the United Kingdom, let alone in Scotland. They have no mandate in Scotland for any legislation. Before the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) starts jumping up and down about unified Parliaments in the United Kingdom, let me make it clear that I do not deny that any Government have the constitutional right to push through legislation. That is not what mandate means. Mandate means the support of the people on a particular issue. The Government have no mandate to legislate separately for Scotland on any basis, whether it be on the poll tax, on transport, on education or on the NHS. The Government suffered an overwhelming defeat at the last general election in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is to argue on those lines, he must explain why large sections of industry in Scotland and England were nationalised without a mandate to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Cathcart may argue for the amendments as they apply to Scotland. The amendments relate, however, to health provisions, not to Scottish industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned the poll tax, which is one example among several, including the Bill. The Government do not have a mandate in Scotland for this or any other legislation. The were beaten in 1979, in 1983 and in 1987, when the number of Tory Members in Scotland fell to 10. The only reason why the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), is the Minister with responsibility for the Health Service is that there was no one else, except the hon. Member for Tayside, North, to put in his place. The Tories were decimated at the last election. If Ministers in the previous
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
Government had remained in Parliament, the hon. Member for Stirling would not be a Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The National Health Service Act 1977 was introduced by a minority Labour Government that did not have a mandate from the people of England. It was brought in on the backs of Scottish Labour Members. The hon. Gentleman's argument is pointless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not understand that there is separate legislation for Scotland. There is no Department of State for England alone.<br><br>
There have been many promises from Ministers and in Tory propaganda about the Bill. We are assured that it is not about privatising the Health Service, or about commercialisation or about putting it all into the hands of insurance companies. The people of Scotland do not trust the Under-Secretary of State with responsibilities for health because of his ideology on the Health Service. That makes it extremely difficult for the Scottish people to accept that he has the right to legislate and to appoint board members without their being given the opportunity to approve or disapprove at a general election.<br><br>
I shall not take up the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member of Workington and speculate on whether the Minister retains his interest in the health company, but prior to becoming a Member of Parliament and a Minister he basically made his living from a privatised part of the Health Service. He is and was a committed member, one of the leading members, of the Adam Smith Institute—that Right-wing think-tank. Well, think-tank is a contradiction in terms when applied to the expression Right-wing. Certainly, those days that institute is a Right-wing advisory body for the Prime Minister and other organisations.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Among the Minister's proposals is, of course, the ultimate privatisation and commercialisation of the Health Service. Before he became a Member of Parliament and a Minister, he was clear in his contempt for the Health Service and all for which it stood. If he had his way, he would introduce the American-type insurance system with only the very poor being reliant on a public health service. That is his view; that is what he would like. That was his track record prior to becoming a Minister in the Scottish Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As for mandates, what mandate did the Labour Government have for most of their policies in England after 1974, especially for the cuts in hospital-building programmes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had explained that. I shall not repeat myself.<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
in such a way it amounts to a personal attack on one Committee member rather than a discussion that is central to the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must direct the hon. Gentleman's attention to the amendment, which is extremely broad. I cannot constrain the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) any further than he is constraining himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a personal attack on the Minister for what he has done as an individual, but it is an attack on him for his political views and stance. He is a Minister, and anyone is entitled to say what I have said.<br><br>
Since the hon. Gentleman became a Minister, he has had to express a different view in his White Papers, and so on, from what I believe he really thinks. But let us consider his track record as a Minister. When he has the compliance of general managers like Laurence Peterken and the Greater Glasgow health board, he has ruthlessly driven Scottish health boards towards privatisation. Prior to his becoming a Minister, the boards refused to follow that course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Minister can respond to the arguments in relation to Scotland. It would, however, benefit the Committee if the hon. Gentleman said where the Bill contains a reference to privatisation. It is much better for the Committee to consider the reality of what is before us—that is, the improvement of the Health Service— rather than speculate on what might or might not happen under certain Administrations in certain conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the hon. Gentleman makes the argument which I have obviously not expressed that well. There is a difference between the wording of the Bill, the White Paper, the concept that Ministers are trying to promote and the Minister's track record. That is my argument, and that is why Scottish people should have the right to make a judgement between the words and the track record before the measure is enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is unnecessary for the Bill to mention the word "Privatisation"? The important point is to expose the intent behind the the Bill. My hon. Friend mentioned the American experience. The Prime Minister and other senior Ministers, including the Secretaries of State for Health and for Education and Science, have made it clear how much they admire the American system. The student loans system was based on the American system. The intent behind this legislation is to produce the sort of health service that is found in America, which I have seen at first hand, and which I am sure the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has also seen and no doubt much admires.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Prior to becoming a Minister, the hon. Gentleman made little secret of the fact that he admired the American system and commercial medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a series of accusations. Everything that I have said is a matter of record, as are the pamphlets that I have published.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister bring them here?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to sell some to the hon. Gentleman if I am allowed to do so without declaring it as an interest.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) made a series of accusations which, surely, he should be able to substantiate. I do not know any colleagues of mine who have expressed open admiration in such general terms for the American system. I recall, however, that the hon. Gentleman's Front Bench colleagues, including the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), returned from the United States saying that they much admired those aspects of the American system which placed more emphasis on patient care and consumer choice. That was the Labour party's view. It is the first time that I can recall in this Parliament when politicians have welcomed and admired the American system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asks me for evidence, but he is taking things well out of context.<br><br>
Perhaps I may reply to the point raised by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) some time ago in his intervention. We are talking about appointments to health boards. Much of the future commercialisation of the Health Service will not require legislation, but it will require appointments to boards of people who will carry it out. One of those whom the Minister has appointed to the Greater Glasgow health board is the same Laurence Peterken whom I have already mentioned. He is the general manager of the health board which has ruthlessly, with the Minister's full consent, pushed privatisation in the Greater Glasgow health board to the point at which it is now considering the privatisation of the radiography, laboratory, X-ray and medical record services. Believe it or not, it is considering the privatisation of the hospital car parks. That is the ultimate silliness in privatisation.<br><br>
People in Scotland will probably look at the Minister's track record and say, in effect, that they want to judge whether he has the right to appoint a new health board before the next general election because they do not believe that he can be trusted to give them the Health Service that they want.<br><br>
On 14 March 1989, less than 12 months ago, a press release revealed that the Secretary of State for Scotland had
<br><blockquote><p>"appointed 92 members to fill vacancies on all 15 Health Boards in Scotland with effect from April 1, 1989."—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>[<i>Interruption.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I find that sedentary interventions never add to a debate and that they are usually much less witty than the people who utter them think they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless I am making them!<br><br>
That press release stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The appointments are for periods of four years to March 31, 1993, unless otherwise indicated.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The White Paper 'Working for Patients' indicated that in future Boards would be somewhat smaller than the current range of 14-22 members and their composition would reflect the changing requirements with members appointed on the basis of the personal contributions which they can make. The appointments now being announced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0445">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
reflect this and the range of membership from April 1, 1989 is now 13–18.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Following the recommendation contained in the White Paper, the General Manager of each Board has been appointed a full member of his Health Board with effect from April 1,1989."</p></blockquote>
Even leaving aside all other factors which I mentioned, and which I believe are relevant to the amendment and to the actions of this Minister and the Government, why have these provisions been introduced? Less than a year ago, the Minister and his right hon. and learned Friend appointed new health boards on the basis of the White Paper, which led to the Bill. What is the purpose of clause 25? Surely it is right for us to wait until after the next general election before we push the appointment of more members to the health boards? My amendment seeks to cut their term of office by almost a year, which may be a little unkind, because the incoming Labour Government may wish to consider the membership of the health boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a most interesting point. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has been complaining that the Conservative party has packed the health boards with its supporters and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is saying that he wants to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. As the hon. Gentleman likes to make his pomposities as often as he possibly can, he does not listen. I know the set up. I said that we might wish to look at the membership of health boards. If we did, we would make them considerably more balanced. However, we would not get rid of all members of the Tory party or the appointees of the CBI. We would ensure that there were more representatives of local authorities on those boards and more appointees from the trade union movement to give them a proper balance. They had a proper balance in the 1970s as you, Mr. Mcwilliam, are aware because you were in Scottish politics when the Labour Government made appointments to health boards. I used to complain sometimes because it seemed to me that the Labour Government were always appointing people from the other side! This Government have never fallen into that trap.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening with fascination to how the hon. Gentleman thinks the board should be compromised—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Compromised is the right word because I want the hon. Gentleman to tell the Committee what percentage of the board should be trade unionists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going down that road—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the hon. Gentleman why. If the hon. Gentleman reads—being an assiduous Member of the Committee I am sure that he will have done so—schedule 5 and the amendments I have tabled, he will see that I have proposed that a certain number of trade unionists should be on the health boards. I shall develop that point further when we discuss the appropriate amendments, which is the right thing to do.<br><br>
In 1992, after the general election, the next Labour Government should have the opportunity to look at the composition of health boards to make them more balanced and, perhaps, extend them. I do not believe
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 198</span>
that smaller boards are necessarily a good thing. For those good reasons, clause 25 and the rest of the Bill as it affects Scotland should be postponed until after 1992. I hope that the Committee will support me accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have just listened to the standard speech from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). It started with mandates and continued with no mandates and no one having the right to do anything. We have heard it all before many times. He shows the frustrations of a gentleman who aspires to be a member of Government. If he follows the example of his predecessors in Government, all the grand speeches he has made in Opposition will quickly be forgotten. The hon. Gentleman will bring into practice the things that he has complained about. The Government of the day, of whatever colour or complexion, puts into practice whatever they believe in. No one should argue against that because that is how democracy works and functions.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart alleges that the amendments are designed to prevent the Government from stacking the committee with their supporters. If I were not a Dundonian born and bred, had not cut my teeth on the politics of Dundee and had not learnt about the practices of Labour administrations in Dundee, perhaps I would have taken on board the hon. Gentleman's good will and good intentions.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will forgive me when I say that my views are conditioned by my experiences in Dundee where the Labour party stacked everything with its supporters at every possible opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman, who often wears a kilt round the House of Commons, feel for the aspirations of 84 per cent. of the Scottish population who reject his philosophy?</span></p>
<p>5.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with the support that I receive in my constituency, Before the hon. Gentleman makes such observations, he should realise that we are all here because we have support in our constituencies. Anyone who thinks that the hon. Gentleman or I, or anyone else, has much influence outside of our own constituencies is not living in the real world.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) and I do not live in the same world. The hon. Gentleman receives support further north in the highlands than I and it is a well-known fact that highlanders hold different views to the people in the lowlands.<br><br>
Highlanders will certainly agree, however, that in the central lowland belt of Scotland—Glasgow, Dundee, Edinburgh or Lothian—the practice of Labour politicians when in office has been to stack whatever is going with their supporters. To say otherwise is not to understand the Scottish political scene. I also spent some years in the north of England and found that the only school with a headmaster who was not a Labour supporter was the headmaster of Johnston grammar school. He was appointed on the day the Labour party called a special meeting. The only people at the election meeting were non-Labour members and he got the job. He certainly would not have secured it otherwise. Johnston was the only grammar school in the north of England.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0446">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 199</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to his constituency position as a Member and said that he was here to represent his constituents, which is where his affinity lies, so he recognises the importance of that. If the majority of Members in Scotland holding those views have a collective position, surely they should aspire to the policy applied in Scotland. That is the hon. Gentleman's own argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that astonishing. The hon. Gentleman's seat disappeared in a by-election and he had to win it back. That occurred in circumstances whereby the Government of the day were a minority Government without support in England where 80 per cent. of the electorate live. They inflicted on England the wishes of the Scottish Members of Parliament because that is where their majority came from.<br><br>
The Labour party cannot have it both ways. If it wants—I believe that it does and the hon. Member for Cathcart certainly does—to occupy the Treasury Bench and make decisions affecting the Health Service in Scotland, the hon. Gentleman must accept that, if history is anything to go by, he may be part of a Government who do not have a majority in England where more than 80 per cent. of the electorate live. The hon. Gentleman must make up his mind about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman keeps referring to my policital aspirations, I shall make them clear to him. Following the next general election, I hope to be a Minister in the Scottish Office team, but thereafter, and reasonably rapidly, I hope to be a member of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, taking decisions on the Scottish Health Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished when the hon. Gentleman says these things. I have never understood why he and some of his colleagues do not join the Scottish National party. At least that party is honest about its aspirations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The puzzle that faces hon. Members from England and Wales about the Labour Front Bench is even greater. The hon. Members for Livingston (Mr. Cook), who is a member of the Committee, for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who is unfortunately ill, and for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) are all Labour spokesmen elected for Scottish constituencies who speak on English health matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I said that this was a broad amendment, and it is, but it is not quite that broad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is only one reason why my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) is transgressing: we are debating whether the Government should accept the amendments, and the basis for acceptance is the allegation made by the hon. Member for Cathcart that the Government have no mandate for what they want to do and should therefore accept the amendments. According to his argument, he is speaking on behalf of a mandate, in which case, it is not unreasonable to argue the other side of the coin. The hon. Gentleman has aspirations to be a Minister and to sit on the Treasury Bench, but if and when that opportunity ever occurs—in my view, it is unlikely to occur in the immediate or near future; by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
that, I mean the next general election, possibly even the one after that—the hon. Gentleman will be too old. He is still of the opinion, however, that Conservative Members should vote for amendments tabled by him and his hon. Friends so that thier mandate can be seen to be accepted. That being so, it is not unreasonable for my hon. Friends representing Welsh and English constituencies to say, "We are not prepared to agree with that, because when the hon. Gentleman and his team are in office they will behave as they have done in the past: they will pay no attention to the lack of mandate in England, and it will not inhibit them from doing some of the things that Labour Governments have done in the past." the hon. Gentleman accepted, when he was elected to this Parliament, as I did, that it is the party that can form the Government in this unitary Parliament that decides the programme of legislation, and it is the duty of the Government, of whatever political persuasion, to carry that out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentlman says, as he always does, that he is in favour of the unitary Parliament, why does he support separate Scottish legislation? Why does he not campaign for the genuine unification of the United Kingdom so that everything, including the Health Service comes under United Kingdom Departments. The hon. Gentleman will not campaign for that, because if he did, he would not hold his seat at the next election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is astonishing. He has been in the House as long as I have yet he does not seem to understand that when I say that I believe in the unitary Parliament that includes—[<i>Interruption</i>], The hon. Gentleman should listen carefully. I have always said that I am in favour of harmonisation, and I believe that most of the legislation going through this place should be dealt with by United Kingdom Committees. There is nothing new in my view. I yield to no one—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Couchman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Is it appropriate for the hon. Gentleman who spoke to the amendment to spend the entire time listening with his mouth?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Cathcart seemed to be listening, and how one listens with one's mouth, I do not know. I have already asked hon. Members to try not to make sedentary interjections. I have also asked hon. Members not to carry on conversations when someone is speaking, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) for drawing that to the Committee's attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister chided me for producing evidence of his views on the Health Service, perhaps the hon. Member for Tayside, North will give me the <i>Hansard</i> references, pamphlets, speeches and press cuttings that he has to support the views that he is expressing about a unified Partliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Cathcart never listens to Radio Clyde and has never seen me on Scottish television, but I know that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) has heard me say the same things many times on Grampian television. If the hon. Member for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
Cathcart is doubting my unionist credentials he has picked on the wrong chap, because it is clear from questions that I have tabled in the House for almost 11 years that I do not qualify what I say. I support the unitary Parliament. I would like much more harmonisation of the legal system, amending some English laws to bring them into line with Scottish laws.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWillams. Fascinating as these constitutional arguments are between my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), I seem to have heard most of them many times before. Would it be possible for us to adopt the procedure that is followed in the United States Congress and have them read into the record? Perhaps they could be put on video, and we could then watch them at our leisure at weekends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order. I hope that we are not about to have a debate on the Scottish legal system, because I should have to rule it out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is so vigorous in his views on a unitary arrangement and the need to legislate in that way, why did he vote for the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland one year before its introduction in the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is wholly wide of the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will not pursue that line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps at some future date the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) will visit my constituency, where the Labour party is lucky to save its deposit and where I should be happy for him to make the comments that he makes in this Committee, because it would increase my majority. In some measure, my majority reflects my personal views. Similarly, the following that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye has in the Highlands reflects his views, and it is reasonable for me to assume that the Highlands like people who speak their mind. They know where they stand with them. That is why I am happy to extend my invitation to the hon. Member for Workington to the hon. Member for Cathcart, because Red Clydesiders are not popular in the Highlands. I am delighted that the Scottish National party has selected a Red Clydesider to oppose me at the next general election, because he will be about as popular—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am tolerant, but the hon. Gentleman is pressing my tolerance too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given his great popularity, perhaps the hon. Member for Tayside, North will tell the Committee what percentage of the vote he obtained in 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing to do with the amendment, and I hope that we can return to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall now end my short contribution, because I believe that the argument about mandates advanced by the hon. Member for Cathcart has been shown to be entirely hollow, has no basis, and should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
not be listened to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to support the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I do not want to rehearse the mandate argument, which has been washed fairly well, yet again, in public. Which side of the argument washes whiter than white will never be resolved when more than two Scots come together in a debating forum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see what I can have said so far to cause the hon. Gentleman to challenge me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wise not to advance the mandate argument because I believe that he was elected as an SDP Member but now sits as an SLD Member, and there has been no election in between.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly not be drawn into the highways and byways of that argument. It would be out or order from your viewpoint, Mr. McWillian, and it would depress me thoroughly to return to some of the convolutions which the merger of the two parties involved 18 months ago.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
A tangential part of the mandate argument in the context of the Bill and its application to Scotland is that, within a United Kingdom Health Service, a distinct Scottish component has been recognised by the Scottish Home and Health Departments by virtue of the existence of that and through the differences that lie within a United Kingdom taxpayer funded system, which I admit has a slightly different structure north of the border from that south of it. Irrespective of the Government in power—this is a view that I have heard expressed by many who may have been critical of the Government from a Health Service professionals' point of view over the past 10 years—I still feel that at times the Scottish Home and Health Departments have either been behind the changes taking place in England and have benefitted from the English making their mistakes first, or have had a distinctive way of either organising or delivering services in Scotland and have felt at times that that distinctiveness has served Scotland well, whatever the hue of the party in power. Over the same period there have been signs that it has not always been so appropriate or so popular with those at the receiving end in England and Wales.<br><br>
I say that in the context of a mandate for Scotland. I am casting my mind back to the original reason for a review of the National Health Service being announced by the Prime Minister, apparently off the cuff, without the advance knowledge of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security—who saw his Department split and himself moved out of Cabinet and replaced by the present incumbent who serves on this Committee. I realise that that was mainly in response to what the Government perceived, as their overwhelming political difficulty south of the Border at the time—convincing the English electorate that, in the hallowed phrase, the NHS was safe in their hands. I do not say that they succeeded in convincing the Scots that it was safe in their hands: health matters and a number of other issues contributed to the difficulties in which the Conservative party found itself, especially in Scotland, at the 1987 general election.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0448">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
The political impetus for the reforms which the Bill have given us was the result of pressures and political difficulties. These manifested themselves most of all in England, more generally in England and Wales, and less so in Scotland, because of either the structure or the set-up of the Health Service there. That is why—I do not wish to go down the highways and byways of political mandates but my sympathy is very much with the arguments of the hon. Member for Cathcart—I consider it legitimate to say that given that there has been an institutional recognition that has traversed Governments of differing political hues as regards the Health Service in Scotland, its delivery mechanisms and structure, so, ideally, it would have been more appropriate to have separate Scottish legislation. Failing that, there has to be recognition that a distinctive Scottish component exists. There is a legitimate argument that the public did not have a chance to vote on such an issue at the last United Kingdom general election and the argument is especially strong in respect of Scotland. The basis of the amendment is justified, and the dates and the delaying mechanism that it would put into the Bill's Scottish component are right. I support the amendment.<br><br>
The Bill is a paving or enabling measure—an increasing feature of Government policy. It has been employed for the poll tax and—along the Corridor, more vividly than for any other measure—for the Student Loans Bill. Bills are becoming shorter and crisper, but less clear and defined. Departments are taking it upon themselves to introduce enabling legislation and to fill in the nuts and bolts.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman), referred to my point of order at the beginning of the sitting as the practicalities of the matter and said that we are now debating the principles. I do not agree. There have to be follow-through regulations for all legislation, but the ex Government have begun to make them the customary modus vivendi. They pass into legislation only the principle. All we are given in debates such as this, which should relate to practical application of the detail, are a few acknowledgements or indications from Ministers of what is perhaps intended or envisaged. We are not given the bones of the measure until regulations or orders are brought before the House or Committee perhaps eight, 12 or 18 months later, depending upon legislation proposals. This increasingly makes a mockery of the Standing Committee system and allows further inadequacies to be built in to our methods of examining Bills.<br><br>
Let us take an example of that with the Bill. Health boards in Scotland have no written constitution, unlike their counterparts om England and Wales. Therefore because the Bill is an enabling measure, much of what it prooposes in principle will be carried out in practice by regulations later.<br><br>
The British Medical Association has asked a pertinent question—I shall assume that the Scottish health Minister will respond to the debate. On the question of future appointments following terminations, will he seek to ensure that there will be continuing medical representation on the successor health boards?<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Cathcart rightly said, all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
membership of health boards in Scotland is within the gift of the Secretary of State. Apart from straightforward medical representation, and given the new set-up that the Bill will impose on Scotland, with free-standing hospitals, the altered position of general practitioners, and budgets, does the Minister envisage having a different sort of personnel on Scottish health boards from that to which we have been accustomed? The fact that none of this information is on the printed page and that it has to be teased out, depending on how much the Minister feels he wants to give away this evening, is deeply unsatisfactory. These facts may not become clear even after the regulations are approved— presumably at a morning sitting in a room such as this several months down the track—and that is even more unsatisfactory. It cannot be good news for those of us who seek to build in provisions to improve the Bill, to try to delay its application, or to discover what the Government are planning.<br><br>
All that adds a general air of uncertainty for many professional people in the Health Service who seek professional representation at health board level for a sensitive ear and understanding of their attitudes, anxieties and priorities. In addition, it adds an air of uncertainty for patients generally. If patients are supposed to come first, the Government should have volunteered the information. It should be in the clause but, as it is not, the Minister should clarify his thinking for the long term in response to the hon. Member for Cathcart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that a former city treasurer of Edinburgh should chair our proceedings, Mr. McWilliam. There was ademocratic input in the City of Edinburgh that would be a breath of fresh air to the future Health Service in Scotland.<br><br>
I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). Two issues have dominated the debate, and I shall try not to become personally absorbed with either in my short contribution. First, there is the mandate argument, and secondly there are the references to the Minister, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth).<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart dealt with the mandate argument crisply and superbly, as we would expect. I was a little surprised by the remarks of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) but I accept that he was repeating the view that he has often expressed in the House and elsewhere. At no time during the Committee's proceedings has he or any other Member said, "Let's wait until the election, when in England, Wales and Scotland the people will give their support to the Government's proposals." The Government may resist my hon. Friend's reasonable amendment because they know that the people of Scotland do not support their policies. In any test of opinion they would be overwhelmingly rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No Conservative Member made such an observation because no Government have made them either. No Government supporter would ever do so. The Labour Government would not have said, "Let's leave nationalisation until after the next general election." If they had done so, they would have lost it. They were a minority Government for much of their period of office.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every Government since the war, of whatever complexion, have had a greater feeling for the sensitivities of the Scottish people than this one, perhaps because of the small number of Conservatives representing Scotland.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Tayside, North believes in a unified Parliament, his support for policies such as this, that are so repugnant to the people of Scotland, presents its greatest challenge.<br><br>
I have no personal grudge against the Minister, although many might think that there are reasons why I should have. I disagree profoundly with his views and his philosophy. I recall an occasion in the halcyon days when there was a Select Committe on Scottish Affairs, of which the Minister and I were members. We visited the island of Eigg, and had a chat as we trooped through the heather and the small lanes of that lovely island. I did my best to try to change the hon. Gentleman's outlook but I failed miserably. Having failed then, I shall not take up the Committee's time in trying to do so again. I have no personal objection to the hon. Gentleman, but his influence on Scottish policies will be seen in the not-too-distant future as an aberration. It is an attempt to impose alien policies, which the hon. Member for Tayside, North seems to ignore, and an alien philosophy, especially in the Health Service. That is unacceptable to the Scottish people and to us.<br><br>
6.16 pm<br><br>
That alien philosophy is reflected in the clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart argued, the present system of appointments is far from ideal. It is undemocratic and a change is needed. If the Minister listened to the people of Scotland, he would be in no doubt about that. The Minister appears to believe that there should be no opposition, which is intolerable. For example, in Lanarkshire, every Member of Parliament and every district council is Labour. The Government removed Edward Dowdalls—a distinguished ex-provost and former principal of Coatbridge college and former vice-president of the convention of Royal boroughs-from a health board. He had made a tremendous contribution to the Health Service but he was replaced at a stroke for political reasons. There is no other explanation for the decision, and it is not unique. Representatives from the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland dominate the Forth Valley health board and are out of all proportion to the number of constituents in each locality.<br><br>
Conservative Members claim that if women, ethnic minorities and disabled people were to be represented on health boards, that would narrow the choice, but neither the Minister nor the Secretary of State blushed when they made appointments that seemed to represent only the views of Conservative Central Office.<br><br>
Given that background, how can we have faith in a Government that ask us to reduce the number of appointments and to leave it to them to take the decisions? If we did, there would be no democratic input into the Scottish Health Service. People demand that because they know that the Scottish Health Service faces difficult times. There is no response to those problems in the Bill, in the Minister's pamphlets or in the various White Papers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
An aging population is a problem elsewhere in the Unitd Kingdom, but there are no Government proposals to deal with it. In Scotland, the Government's proposals are irrelevant. We have the highest death rate from heart disease and respiratory illness per head of population in western Europe. I accept that lifestyles and the quality of life have a great effect on deaths, but these fragmented proposals do nothing to tackle the problem. That is all the more reason for insisting that those involved in formulating policy in the Health Service communicate with patients.<br><br>
The Minister's narrow approach, and his decision about appointments do not suggest that he and his tiny band of supporters represent the fountain of all wisdom. Our proposals would correct that. There is a more than reasonable case for delaying a decision, as suggested in the amendment by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart.<br><br>
Why are the Government so afraid of the views of the people? I have served on other Committees. I do not want to stray too far off the subject, but I have heard Ministers discussing employment legislation argue that unions should be handed back to the membership. Why are the Government taking the Scottish Health Service away from the patients? That is what this clause would do. People will continue to ask questions about the role of preventive medicine and the immunisation programme in Scotland. Is best practice to be confined to one area? Is there to be a strategy throughout Scotland? In the past, that was the only way to solve the problems of illnesses such as tuberculosis and rickets. The people of Scotland saw that they had a Health Service that was recognised as such. They had some democratic input. They are entitled to express their views on the efficiency or otherwise of that service to a greater extent than this Minister will allow.<br><br>
I promised to be brief, so I shall conclude by saying that, in common with our other amendments, this amendment is perfectly workable, logical and reasonable. If the Minister's reply is consistent with all the replies given so far to this Committee, and if he resists something as reasonable as this, the Scottish people will conclude that the Prime Minister misled them when she came to Perth before the last election and said that the Health Service was safe only in her hands. The Scottish people want the Health Service back where it should be—in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate. I shall not be drawn too far on the mandate argument, but I should like to make one observation in support of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) about the unitary Parliament.<br><br>
Because of the formula funding of the Scottish Office, our current arrangement enables the Health Service in Scotland to be in a unique position. The Secretary of State can decide how much resource is allocated to the Health Service, and it receives as an automatic consequence the funding that is provided for the Health Service in England. The result is that the Health Service in Scotland has been some 25 per cent. better funded than the Health Service in the south. I have yet to hear a speech from any Opposition Member who has argued that, as a result, it is better than the Health Service south of the border or that all the problems have been resolved.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) represents a constituency in the best funded board in the United Kingdom—the Greater Glasgow health board—and all we hear from the Labour party are complaints about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been cut.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has never been cut; it has had growth in funding every year. The only year when the Greater Glasgow health board had to face cuts was during the last Labour Government when the IMF forced it to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just made a very interesting comment. Why does Scotland get more money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to stray too far out of order, but the hon. Gentleman will recall that the Labour party promised an Assembly for Scotland which it was unable to deliver in the House of Commons. As a result of that, an agreement was reached that funding for the Scottish Office should be on the basis of a formula which gives 10/85ths of the funding which is provided on another basis. That is why we have additional expenditure on the Health Service in Scotland. The other reason is that the Government, in the Scottish Office, have decided to make resource available within the block for the Health Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point, and raising it now may save debate later. The Goschen formula, to which my hon. Friend referred, which was amended by Joel Barnett in 1978, also applies to Wales. We receive 5/58ths, which means that Wales is in a better position than England in terms of Health Service funding. There has been a 45 per cent. increase in Health Service spending in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The clause does not apply to Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to a historic decision which I am sure was welcomed by many of my hon. Friends. Does he feel that the additional money is justified, irrespective of decisions that were taken earlier and, if so, why does he defend its allocation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem is not mine; it is for the hon. Gentleman's party. I welcome his interest in affairs north of the border, and I am delighted at his interest in me. Perhaps he will now listen to my argument, which is particularly important for those Opposition Members who represent English constituencies.<br><br>
The Labour party is arguing that the Health Service and other services in Scotland should be controlled and run by a Scottish Assembly, which should have tax-raising powers. That would mean that additional funding would have to be raised in Scotland. Across the board, including the Health Service, that additional revenue amounts to £2.6 billion. Raising that money in Scotland would be the equivalent of putting an extra 20 pence on income tax, so there is a real benefit to the Health Service from the unitary Parliament and the existing system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer my question? How does he defend that additional expen-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
diture? He tells us that Scotland receives more. He refers to the health board in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). Why does that board now receive more? Does the Minister feel that it deserves more, or that it is receiving too much? Does he defend what it receives?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only do I defend it, but when we decided to allocate additional expenditure, we were in a position to do so, unlike the previous Labour Government which presided over cuts in the Health Service in Scotland.<br><br>
We would like a change in the composition of the health boards because although the resource is required, providing it is not the be all and end all. What is important is how it is deployed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart talked about privatisation. There has been no privatisation in the Health Service in Scotland. There has been competitive tendering, which has released £62 million of additional resources to the Health Service. Three-quarters of contracts have been won by NUPE and COHSE—the in-house work force. Competitive tendering is not the same as privatisation. The hon. Gentleman seeks to confuse them. Competitive tendering is entirely reasonable and has released £62 million of additional revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the fact that threequarters of those contracts have been let to COHSE and NUPE reveals that there was a great deal of spare in the system before, and that some of the old Spanish practices have been dispensed with?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The result is that £62 million has been available to health boards to spend on extra patient services such as additional nurses, doctors and service departments, some of which has taken place in the constituency of the hon. Member for Cathcart.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart said that the point of the amendment was to delay implementation of the provisions until the next general election. He argued for a separate Scottish Bill to deal with the matter.—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interventions do not help. I wish hon. Members would refrain from making them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not respond to that sedentary intervention, but the Labour party position on Second Reading was that there should be a separate Scottish Bill. I am glad if that stance has now changed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart will be aware that his intention to table an amendment seeking that everything should be delayed until after the next election is hardly in the interests of the Health Service in Scotland. We believe that the reforms will improve the Health Service. It is important that they are brought into effect so that patients can benefit from them and so that there is increased choice.<br><br>
The Labour party argues strongly that Scottish interests have not been considered, no Scottish Labour Back Bench member spoke of the Bill on Second

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
Reading. A total of 27 amendments were tabled to the Scottish clauses, many of which were straightforward copies of English amendments. If the hon. Member for Cathcart seriously argues that he represents the Scottish interests—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Is it proper for a Minister to challenge Mr. Speaker's selection of Back Benchers to speak in a debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. The selection of who speaks in the House—or in Committee—is entirely a matter for the Chair. It is not a matter for comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not seeking to challenge Mr. Speaker. Before he can call hon. Members, they have to be present in the Chamber. The hon. Gentleman is incorrect, I took careful note of who was—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The admonition I gave about sedentary interventions applies to all members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is not exempt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart is mistaken. His argument that implementation should not take place until after the next general election may arise from a confusion about what that particular power is about. It is a one-off opportunity to reduce the size of the health boards. The hon. Gentleman seemed to assume that everyone who had been appointed until 1993 would be removed from their membership of a health board, they can be reappointed. The purpose is to get a balanced board when it is reduced.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) asked me to say what sort of people should be appointed. The boards will have important new responsibilities. They will be responsible for defining the nature of the Health Service in their area, and for making contracts with hospitals within their control, with self-governing hospitals and with the private sector. They will be involved in the strategic planning of the delivery of the health service. Board members should have expertise, knowledge and ability. They should be there for what they know, not because of who nominated them. They should be appointed because of their experience and expertise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The gravamen of the Opposition's charge appears to be that my hon. Friend the Minister is making political appointments and that more local councillors should serve on those boards. I suspect that those arguments are logically inconsistent. Is it true that local councillors give better service on such boards—he has evidence of their attendance and their commitment—given their other heavy responsibilities? Can he deal with the charge that he has made primarily political appointments during his time as Minister with responsibility for health?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The system set up by the Labour Government in Scotland, which does not provide for the automatic appointment of councillors, has resulted in councillors being appointed to health boards in Scotland. For understandable reasons, many have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
found it difficult to attend meetings, and their attendance is poorer than that of other board members. That is one reason why we do not want automatic membership for councillors of the sort suggested.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Cathcart and for Ross, Cromarty and Skye raised the subject of political appointments more or less obliquely earlier today. I have answered several questions about appointments to health boards. Those answers set out clearly the composition of health boards. I answered a question on 27 July 1988 at c.<b>314,</b> and another on 14 April 1989 at c.<b>758.</b> Those answers list all the people who have been appointed to health boards, and who the nominating bodies are.</span></p>

<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>6.50 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to two parliamentary answers on the composition of the health boards and nominating bodies. Some Opposition Members have complained that the health boards are being packed with political appointees. The nominating bodies—for example, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Midwives and so on—would take great offence at the suggestion that they are a front for the Conservative party.<br><br>
I had covered most of the issues that were directly relevant to the amendments. The streamlined health bodies that we wish to see in Scotland will continue to have members appointed on the basis not of whom they represent—that is what the Opposition seem to want—but of what they know. Those people will have first-class skills and experience and will be committed to making decisions for the benefit of all patients without beating the drum for sectional interests. The health boards will spend with maximum effect the vast resources—this year they will exceed £3 billion in Scotland for the first time—devoted to patient care. They will use their expertise to secure top quality, best value health services, to widen patient choice and to plan wisely and imaginatively for future needs. The basis on which the boards will be appointed was set out by the Labour Government in their Green Paper in 1968, when they stated that the Secretary of State is responsible to Parliament for the Health Service and that it is therefore right and appropriate that the Secretary of State's appointees should form the health boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for missing the first minute of his speech. When he replied to my point about the composition of health boards, did the tenor of his comments mean that he believes that there is a continuing need and role for medical representation by experts and those who are knowledgeable in specific medical matters on health boards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Genetleman reads what I said about the required qualities, it would be odd if health boards did not include professional interests and representation. The representatives may not be consultants employed by the health board on which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0452">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
they sit, but it is important that the boards have the range of expertise that is necessary to carry out their considerable responsibilities.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's constituency is in the Highland health board area. The health boards in Scotland are diverse; they vary in size and in the nature of their communities. The Greater Glasgow health board is large and approximately one quarter of the expenditure in Scotland is attributable to that board; Shetland health board is at the other extreme. Therefore, we have not specified a rigid structure in appointments to health boards. We prefer small boards reflecting the required expertise and having an adaptable structure to meet their responsibilities and the health needs of specific areas. I am sure that that is the correct solution for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the Minister, I do not wish to delay the Committee. However, I expected a more comprehensive reply to the debate than he gave us. The Minister referred to certain elementary replies. Does he recall, as reported in yesterday's <i>Hansard</i> at column 70, that he replied to a question from the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and mentioned that the number of beds for mentally-ill patients had declined by 3,000 since 1979. Given that the community has obligations in that area, I had hoped that the Minister would say something about community care. Will he bear that in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will probably be more aware of our proposals on community care than other hon. Members. I have made responsibilities of health boards perfectly clear. I have explained at some length that we do not intend to have people on health boards who represent particular sectional interests. Rather, we want people with the expertise necessary to carry out the boards' important responsibilities. Community care responsibilities will fall on the local authorities. The principal responsibilities of the health boards will be to examine the situation in their areas-especially diverse in Scotland-to determine needs and make the contractual arrangements to meet them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Monklands, West says that he is disappointed in my response. Most speeches were not directly related to the amendment, although they were, of course, in order or you would not have allowed them to proceed, Mr. McWilliam. The only points of substance that have been raised relate to the composition of the boards, and I have dealt with that. I was asked why that matter had not been dealt with earlier when we declared our intention to slim down the boards. The hon. Member for Cathcart read out a press release, which explained why. It is also right for the boards to be balanced. That is why we have retained the appropriate power on a one-off basis.<br><br>
As we shall see when we debate later amendments, there is a great inconsistency in the Opposition's position, for they wish to extend the range of the boards' members who can be dismissed by the Secretary of State to include chairmen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to confirm that if hon. Members had made points that were out of order, you would have so ruled, Mr. McWilliam. Opposition Members are more than a little worried
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
when the Minister refers to community care as a sectional interest. Are we to assume that appointed persons will share the Minister's views on such a crucial matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart, who talked about political appointments, should know that during the adjournment I spoke to one of his parliamentary colleagues whose wife is a member of a health board and does a splendid job. That should correct the hon. Gentleman's views about appointments. If the hon. Gentleman were fair, he would examine the appointments, the nominating bodies and the answers that I have given and recognise that we want people with appropriate expertise to run the boards. Some say that the expertise should relate to community care; others believe it should relate to other services. I therefore suggest that the hon. Member for Cathcart should withdraw his amendment, especially after the assurances that I have given about the Health Service in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my intention to withdraw my amendment after a few words, but let me tell the Minster that my withdrawal has nothing to do with any of the assurances that he has given me. I withdraw the amendment for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman's abysmal climbdown after a few lyrical words from the Minister. I am reassured by the Minister's remarks on the detail, but I remain hostile to the basis of the Bill. The purpose of the amendment is to insert a date. That would put the measure beyond reach of the next general election. Politically, we should push the Minister on this point.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has a guilty conscience as he was not present when his amendment was put to a vote. I know that the son of Jimmy Mack may have problems on this Committee. Jimmy Mack is a Scottish disc jockey who moved from BBC radio to another station just before Christmas and was replaced on the BBC programme during the holiday period by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Moonlighting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should debate again, and vote on, this important matter on Report, so I shall not press the amendment now. I am glad that the Scottish Office Minister issued a press release, which he had to do as I gather that the Scottish Office is currently holding a press reception.<br><br>
I am sure that when the Secretary of State for Scotland appointed all those good people to health boards less than 12 months ago and asked them to give up valuable time for just their expenses, he did not tell them that they would be dismissed within a short period and replaced by people who would receive salaries. He was told by the Secretary of State for Health that the provisions in the part of the Bill relating to Scotland must be similar to those in other parts of the Bill and he had to obey that order.<br><br>
As I wish to raise this matter later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 140, in page 22, line 43, leave out subsection (2).<br><br>
This will not take long. I do not understand why when every member of the board will be dismissed, the chairman is to stay in place. Can the Minister explain that provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was prepared to give careful consideration to the arguments on this particular amendment, and even though the hon. Gentleman has not advanced any arguments I shall give him an explanation. He has assumed throughout that those who were appointed will be dismissed. That is not the position. Nothing in the Bill sets out the timing of the power, or when it will be used. The power exists, and if the Secretary of State were to exercise it, for example, on 1 April 1991, half the membership of the health boards in Scotland would have demitted office anyway. Those appointed already may continue in office and additional appointments may be made.<br><br>
The power exists to ensure flexibility and balance. Also, to ensure continuity, it was not thought appropriate to extend it to the chairman of the boards, the Committee Services Agency and the state hospitals. If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), having argued that this power should not be used, now argues that it should be extended to include the chairmen, I am happy to consider those arguments and to give an undertaking to consider his amendment, but it might be wiser for him to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful. In three and a half years' time someone may discover this probing amendment and may start putting leaflets around Glasgow about it. I take the Ministers point. The chairman is the one person who is paid a salary. It may not be so easy to get rid of him as it is to get rid of the rest of the board. However, the Minister is totally wrong because the clause says:
<br><blockquote><p>"a member of a Health Board shall cease to be such a member."</p></blockquote>
It is irrelvant whether the Minister then reappoints him. He ceases to be a member when the Minister so decides. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one quick point to make to the Minister who was complaining that I had not tabled enough amendments. One of the reasons for that is that the Scottish Bill amends the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 almost in its entirety. This is the first time that I have been able to get a copy of it, outside the Library. It was not available to hon. Members in the Vote Office, so it was not possible to amend it. I still have in my pocket the card that I got from the Vote Office which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"With regret the papers that you ordered are now out of print."</p></blockquote>
That makes the job of Opposition spokesmen rather difficult.<br><br>
The amendments run contrary to the principles which the Minister has been adducing. There is a major conflict of opinion between us here. He believes in appointing managerial style health boards to run the Health Service. I do not believe that his hon. Friend's who are non-executive members of companies —I gather that the Under-Secretary had a long list of directorships until be became a Minister—believe that they are there to run the company. They are there to decide the policy and to advise the company on how best to run its affairs. They are not there to manage. The same applies to health boards. Members of health boards are not there to manage; they are there to advise, to set policy and to set the tone of the health boards. There are people below them who will run it.<br><br>
Those who run the companies should perhaps be on the board. Under Amendment No. 179 one of the appointees must be the general manager of the health board. A health board that is working in an area should have some relationship with the community and its political complexion. The system of boards has gone so wrong over the past 10 years because the Minister and the Secretary of States have failed to take account of the political representations and the views, represented through the political structure, of those whom the board is supposed to serve. As my hon. Friend for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said earlier, Lanarkshire health board on which there is not a single Conservative Member of Parliament and hardly a Conservative regional or district councillor, is essentially dominated by those who are of the same political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0454">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
persuasion as the Minister who appoints them. The Greater Glasgow health board has no Conservative Member of Parliament, no regional councillor and only four district councillors. That is the only representation from the Conservative party, yet the health board is dominated by nominees of the same political persuasion as the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
Naturally, the Minister makes appointments from the nominations received. He said that it was an insult to the royal colleges not to accept their recommendations. But the royal colleges compile a list of suitable nominees, as does the Scottish Trade Union Council, the CBI and local authorities, from which the Minister selects members, if he wishes. He chooses a person whom he considers to be closest to him politically.<br><br>
The lack of ethnic representation on Scottish health boards is a disgrace. The aristocracy outnumbers by three to one members of the ethnic minorities in Scotland serving on Scottish health boards. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) may be interested to know that. Lady Sanderson of Bowden is a member of the Borders health board. Her name may ring a bell with some hon. Members. Lord Sanderson of Bowden is Minister in the Scottish Office. I assume that it is his wife who is a member of the Borders health board.<br><br>
Another member of the aristocracy on a health board is the Countess of Dalkeith. I believe that her brother-in-law is Michael Ancram, who was a Minister in the previous Government. If he hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) would do the decent thing, according to his standards, and retire at the next general election, no doubt Michael Ancram would compete strongly for that seat. Perhaps the reason why the hon. Gentleman is not retiring at the next general election is that he is not keen on that gentleman.<br><br>
Lady Goold is a member of the Greater Glasgow health board. She is the wife of the Under-Secretary's predecessor, who is chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland. He was elevated to the peerage and now occasionally speaks for the Conservative party in the other place.<br><br>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) has left the Room as, having said that the ethnic minorities are outnumbered by three to one, I realise that the members whom I have listed are all women.<br><br>
The manner in which appointments have been made over the past 10 years has destroyed the relationship between health boards and the areas that they serve. There should be a democratic link. I do not claim that what I suggest is a perfect solution; it is not. If I had my way, when we come to power in 1991 or 1992, we should have, as a short-term solution, a similar arrangement to the present one, but thereafter, when we have a Scottish assembly, we should review the democratic structure of the health boards in Scotland and perhaps come up with more democratic suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it true that the largest single ethnic minority in Scotland are the English?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends on how one defines an ethnic minority. The Scottish group is well represented. I hasten to add that I am not a member of that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
so-called ethnic minority. My background is entirely Scottish, even though I was born in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the parliamentary Labour party for Scotland has a fair representation of English ethnic members?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point. If we had our way we would ensure a higher ethnic representation on health boards, because ethnic groups play an important part in society in cities such as Glasgow.</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying from the amendment. The argument about ethnic minorities and other countries' groups may become embarrassing to the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that we should put forward such arguments. My amendment suggests a solution to the unrepresentative nature of the present boards. If the Minister will not accept my amendment, he should say how he intends to make boards more democratic. We have a major difference of opinion. The Opposition believe that health boards should represent the communities in which they operate. They should not have members who are elected simply for their managerial skills; I say that in particular because I do not have a high opinion of managers in Scotland.<br><br>
Amendment No. 181 denies with a specific part of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 which says that no health board should insist on its consultants being full-time members. Why is that so? I do not think that it is because it seeks to ensure that married women can go back to work. Rather, it seeks to ensure that consultants may carry out private medicine if they wish.<br><br>
Amendment No. 182 deals with the remuneration of loss of earnings with which health boards can assist a member of the board. It is slightly absurd simultaneously to pay all members employed by a health board a salary and to remunerate them for their loss of earnings. I assume that that is an oversight, and that the Minister may accept that amendment.<br><br>
If the Minister will not accept amendment No. 180, he should remove the right of people to be paid to be members of health boards. Why does the Minister believe that payment for health board members is so important, especially when the Government are cutting back so dramatically on local councillors' allowances in the major conurbations and counties of Scotland? Some councils will not lose out, but many will. At the same time as cutting back, the Minister is giving a salary to his place men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Place persons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. How does the Minister intend to pay them and why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he was unable to obtain a copy of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978, which is why no Scottish amendments have been tabled. I think that I have unearthed the mystery of why I was able to obtain copy from the Vote Office and the hon. Gentleman was not. I think that he asked for chapter 13 of the Act which is the Northern Ireland education measure.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, it is entirely the Vote Office's fault, because I asked them for the Act by name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask that this matter be pursued through House of Commons channels. We must get on with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to suggest that the hon. Gentleman is at fault. I want to make Members of the Committee aware that the Act is available.<br><br>
I shall deal first with the suggested scheme for the health boards and how that will affect the hon. Gentleman's health board, the Greater Glasgow health board, if we accept amendments Nos. 178 and 179 which give various bodies rights of appointment. Because the Greater Glasgow health board is covered by five district councils, all of which will have nomination rights, a total of 15 people will be nominated by local authorities. On the hon. Gentleman's formula, the Greater Glasgow health board will become a body with about 30 members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should get his sums right. It is clearly stated that there will be two members from each regional council—only one is included in the Greater Glasgow health board, Strathclyde—and one from each district council. The Minister said that there are five district councils in the area, which I accept. The total is therefore seven members, not 15.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. There are also the nominations from the universities and other bodies—[Interruption.] Let us not waste the Committee's time. If the hon. Gentleman goes through the calculations he will find that his formula will produce for the Greater Glasgow health board 30 or more members, depending on how many people the Secretary of State has to appoint to make up the 40 per cent. quota of women. That will produce a huge body with executive functions that is unwieldy and unworkable. That is a recipe for talk, not action.<br><br>
The other amendments that we are being asked to consider seek to give the Secretary of State power to require all consultants employed by health boards to work full time. — [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Cathcart is interrupting me from a sedantry position. I am happy to give away to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments will give a health board exactly the same powers in relation to consultants as it has for any other employees within its board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 181 clearly seeks to remove a restriction on the Secretary of State's regulation power to give him a power that no Secretary of State will sensibly wish to use. Is the hon Gentleman arguing that he wishes to outlaw part-time status? I know what he is driving at. He is worried about people doing private work within the Health Service. The effect of that amendment will be to provide a power which will prevent people from working part time, particularly women consultants with young children. I simply do not think that any Secretary of State will wish to use such a power.<br><br>
Amendment No. 182 makes it obvious that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about remuneration for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
members of health boards. He is wrong in what he says about the Government's proposals in respect of the remuneration of councillors. Members of the Committee who represent English constituencies may be interested to know that councillors in Scotland claim 40 per cent. more in attendance allowances and remuneration than councillors south of the border. The sum totals £4 million and will not be reduced.<br><br>
The argument is that to get the high-powered people we want on health boards we should have a power that provides for remuneration. There will be consultation about that, but no commitment has been given to use that power at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A different point which I believe is contained in amendment No. 179 may be of interest to the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and other members of the Committee. The Minister has not made it clear where the Government stand on joint planning in Scotland and we are entitled to know his view. Griffiths, for example, thought that this point was so important that he saw a lead role for local government.<br><br>
I will press the Minister because we are entitled to know whether the Government, having failed to implement the joint planning mechanism of the National Health Service (Amendment) Act 1986, are now declining to accept even the Griffiths recommendation, despite the pressure for joint planning from professional and voluntary bodies in Scotland. Will he briefly explain the Government's attitude to joint planning in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I always try to give a courteous response to all members of the Committee. I cannot see how joint planning relates to the composition of health boards, which is what amendments Nos. 178 and 179 are about, or to the Secretary of State's power to require all consultants with health boards to work full time, which is what amendment No. 181 is about. Amendment No. 182 seeks to remove the right of members of health boards and their committees to claim compensation for loss of earnings. Amendment No. 180 seeks to remove the Secretary of State's proposed new power to remunerate non-executuve health board members. The amendments deal with the composition of health boards and the basis on which expenses and remuneration of their members should be dealt with. A separate issue is whether we should outlaw part-time working for consultants in Scotland. I repeat that I cannot see how joint planning relates to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly worried because it seems that the Minister cannot see the relationship between appointments to health boards and joint planning. Joint planning ought to mean—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is right. We are discussing not that relationship but this group of amendments. If the hon. Member wishes to develop his point he must do so on another group of amendments or the schedule, but certainly he cannot develop it on this group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, I shall give way to him.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0456">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister as I wish to intervene.<br><br>
I accept your ruling, Mr. McWilliam, but it may later be possible to draw the Minister's attention to the crucial importance of health boards working with local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that health boards should work with those authorities and especially with regional authorities, but confusion has permeated the minds of Opposition Members. They associate the desire for health boards to carry out their responsibilities with the appointment of members of various interest groups. That is completely unworkable. We want people of calibre to be members of our health boards and for the Bill to provide power to enable the Secretary of State to make appropriate arrangements for the remuneration or compensation for loss of earnings to ensure that appropriate people will participate in an important public service to their communities.<br><br>
Sometimes, I get the impression that some Opposition Members oppose for the sake of opposition. How is it possible for the Labour party in Scotland to argue that it is important that councillors should receive remuneration so that people will come forward to serve in local government, and for the hon. Member for Monklands, West to argue in Committee against the Bill providing power to enable us to remunerate members of health boards? The argument is inconsistent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not pay the others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has not participated in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Lady wishes to participate in the debate I hope that she will not do so from a sedentary position. I have already told off the Committee about such behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Bill, we propose a flexible system which will enable appointments and remuneration to be established according to the circumstances of various boards. None of the amendments is desirable and I ask for them to be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to amendment No. 182, it is astonishing that the Minister should say that he will pay health board members a salary. If they have another job and lose pay when they are away from it, they will be paid for that loss of earnings, too. He is using double standards if he is prepared to pay his appointees in that way.<br><br>
I do not necessarily have reservations about paying people, but I reiterate my argument about local councillors. The councillors of large authorities, who must attend many meetings during the day, lose out while councillors of the smaller authorities areas who meet in the evenings gain as a result of the Government's cash-limited changes. Councillors in Scotland are paid more because they attend more meetings and have more to do as the councils tend to be bigger, since the larger councils in England were abolished.</span></p>
<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going down a blind alley and I want to save the Committee's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
time. There is provision to pay for loss of earnings because that provision applies to members of health board committees who may not be members of the health board. The hon. Gentleman misunderstood the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It applies to members of the health board, too. I read the original schedule to obtain that information—I am not sure whether the Minister has done that<br><br>
There is an important difference of opinion about the nature of health boards, which is shown in the amendments. We believe that they should be managerial in style and small in number.<br><br>
A board must represent the community and ensure that people are properly represented. It should have a sufficient number of women and representatives from local authorities. A board in Glasgow of 30 covering an area which has 1 million people is not necessarily a bad thing. Our amendment is not perfect but it would be more democratic, so I ask my hon. Friends to support it.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the provision that allows staff to be transferred. I have tabled a starred amendment to deal with that provision as the matter has been raised with me recently by people who are worried about it. It would be wrong for a doctor or nurse in Glasgow to be transferred against their wishes to work on the islands of Lewis, Orkney or Shetland. Some people might wish to be transferred to such lovely islands, but it cannot be right for the boards to be given that power. Therefore, I shall table the amendment again on Report, when I hope to be able to debate it.</span></p>
