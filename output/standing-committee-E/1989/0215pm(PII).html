	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, Dame Janet, the arguments about the amendment were confused. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hin-chliffe) said that he wanted resources to be used effectively. The Government agree with that. The decision to use residential care is a serious one. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands how the Government believe that they should deal with local government. The idea that the procedure for an assessment within local government should be centrally dictated scarcely bears contemplation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who suggested that central Government should dictate how to carry out an assessment to local government? The amendments are about the allocation of resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomely</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deals with inserting the words
	<br><q><p>"at Chief Officer level."</p></q>
The responsibility for the overall management of the social services department lies with the social services committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). Paragraph 3.3.5 of the White Paper states:
	<br><q><p>"The Government also sees advantage in linking case management with delegated responsibility for budgetary management."</p></q>
That is a comment on a useful practice, not a direction. My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) spoke about Kent where—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gillingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can advise me on every aspect of the geography of Kent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. John McWilliam 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Kent, social workers have used case management and it has been useful and effective. But the Government will not require that people use case management or budgetary management. The hon. Member for Wakefield talked about resources for community care plans. Those are a matter for the public expenditure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1052</span>
discussions. Adequate resources will be available, but they must be used effectively. Provisions in the Bill will achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister see any differences between the two amendments? We did not necessarily choose that they should be grouped together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central issue behind amendment No. 649 is the need to monitor at a senior level the use of resources for institutional care. Why should the system for adults in care differ from the system for children in care? The question of resources remains the same. There is no logical reason why adults and children should be treated differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand to be corrected, but we do not specify in legislation the level of the social services officer who must authorise any decision to place children in care. Social services departments are entrusted with making enormously important decisions about the lives of clients and their carers. It is important that the management structure enables such decisions to be made thoughtfully, carefully and with regard to available resources. The development of proper complaints procedures is part and parcel of good social work practice and the provision of care to the frail and vulnerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that much can be gained from pursuing the important points that have been made in this short debate. It is clear that the Minister has not understood the practical concerns expressed by my hon. Friend for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and myself. We said that there was a potential conflict between the results of assessment and the allocation of resources to meet the required provision. Will the Minister undertake to read the record of what was said by my hon. Friend and myself, and say how she and her right hon. and learned Friend will ensure that the monitoring and allocation of resources are not done on a junior level. A danger of that arises in paragraph 3.3.5 of the White Paper. We all know the difficulty faced by social services in meeting the legal requirements that are placed upon them, and the furore that breaks out when occasional cases cause problems. I ask the Minister to undertake to write in detail about these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

have to return on Report to the serious topic that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hin-chliffe) have raised, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 433, in page 42, line 12, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(c) No disposal of the person's assets (including property, whether owned, leased or rented) shall be permitted until an assessment has been made which indicates the need for permanent residential accommodation.".</p></q>
I shall be extremely brief in speaking to the amendment, which would ensure that owner-occupiers and tenants who go into permanent residential accommodation do not lose their homes or other property until a proper assessment has been made of their needs. My local social services department in Haverfordwest has told me that many times clients have been placed in temporary accommodation which has had to become permanent because of the loss of tenancy of a local authority or housing association property. On other occaions, relatives have persuaded clients to sell their houses. A house is a person's most valuable asset. While an assessment is in hand there should be a safeguard to ensure that it is not disposed of in such a way as to present the local authority with a fait accompli.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) has raised a worrying matter which Lady Wagner outlined in her report. It is a question of good practice, and we have already issued further guidelines. As has been said in the Commitee several times, the period after a person is admitted to a residential home is a time of assessment, the outcome of which is often unpredictable. Many elderly people can recover remarkably after a small amount of care, intervention or medical assistance. An assessment is not a photograph, it is a cine film. Understanding a person's problem and finding a solution takes a little time. The distinction between temporary and permanent care is important when it comes to charging, as was noted earlier this week. It was made clear that our regulations would not let the mechanisms of charging undermine rehabilitative work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke will be satisfied with that. The amendment contains some legal imprecisions, but I thank him for drawing the matter to the Committee's attention. We shall certainly press local authorities to be aware of it in the execution of their tasks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reply is not good enough. The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) has asked for an undertaking and tried to drive the amendment into the Bill. He is worried that local authorities may not abide by guidance notes. What is wrong with accepting that principle within the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Minister, and on the basis of her assurance I shall not press the amendment. When the guidance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1054</span>
notes are issued, will the Department of Health, and the Welsh and Scottish Office departments of health, monitor how they are observed? If practice does not change, and authorities are still confronted with many people in danger of losing their property, will the Department re-examine the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The Department, the National Institute for Social Work and other organisations will continue to look at the matter to ensure that the guidance is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advice and guidance may be clear, but a local authority may ignore it. What would the Government do then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discuss the Secretary of State's powers of intervention under clause 44,1 suspect that the same Opposition Members who have queried whether the Bill will be satisfactorily operated will change their colour entirely and complain about the Secretary of State's powers of direction. Those powers will ensure that the Bill's provisions will be translated into action. The Secretary of State will not hesitate to use them if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I press my hon. Friend the Minister a little further? Will the Department monitor observance and ensure that a report is made after a year, perhaps through the inspectorate's annual report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstands our purpose in questioning the Secretary of State's use of his powers. We are interested in protecting the consumer's interest. Why cannot this eminently sensible amendment be accepted? Why should we rely on notes of guidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the first time this Parliament, the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) has raised an important issue. Does the Minister agree with the policy of the Department of Social Security on the continued payment of housing benefit to those who enter residential care? Would it be possible for a person to receive housing benefit long enough for them to reconsider whether institutional care was his best course of action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some techincal points that I had hoped to spare the Committee. The amendment refers only to residential and not nursing homes. It would not provide for people who wanted to sell their homes. It assumes that a local authority has such a power. The amendment would have to be altogether different if it were to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) referred to housing benefit, which is more properly a matter for the Department of Social Security. I have made clear that it is important not to undermine rehabilitation. The outcome of an individual entering a residential home is not always predictable. The decision to go into such a home is serious, should not be taken lightly and should not be irreversible. We shall continue to draw those considerations to the attention of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1055</span>
I cannot give my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke the commitment that we shall report within a year because, after the measures are implemented, we shall offer advice and monitoring on many fronts. However, I assure him that we shall continue to consider his point and incorporate it in the overall review of the way in which the policy is implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 769, in page 42, line 22, after "directions", insert—
	<br><q><p>"subject to subsection (2A) above".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 645 requires a detailed statement in writing of the outcome of an individual assessment. A written assessment would have the status of a contract and a client would be in a better position to require the provision of services if the assessment were set out clearly in writing. An assessment should be a serious and important process that must be recorded properly, with a copy of that record going to the client and to anybody else involved in the outcome of the assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper gave a commitment to the consultation process and to the involvement of service users. The consumer can make an informed choice only if he or she knows the services available and the outcome of an assessment. That should be put in writing. A purely
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1056</span>
oral report of an assessment is tailor-made for ambiguity and confusion and could cause a dispute between the client and the Department involved. A written assessment would be a safeguard to the client and to the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 30 anticipates that some clients would dispute the outcome of an assessment. For example, an assessment recommending an institutional placement may be disputed by individuals who feel that they have a right to demand services in the community. I look forward to when people do demand their right to such services rather than accepting that the only alternative is to enter institutional care. There should be a procedure by which people can appeal against decisions and have a right to a second hearing when their feelings may be taken on board by another party. The amendments make sense and we hope the the Government agree.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 683 is remarkably similar to amendment No. 645. I support the remarks of the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe). The amendment is supported by the Association of Directors of Social Services, which would be responsible for providing the written assessment. The professionals responsible for the assessment process would greatly value that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) will probably want to speak to the amendment dealing with appeals. We are discussing important services. At present, there is no process by which people can appeal or complain. A person who is wrongly denied services cannot do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 9 is similar to amendment No. 770 but, for some reason, it has not been grouped with it. It would provide an appeals or complaints machinery. There is an appeal process within local authorities for housing benefits. If people believe that they have had a raw deal, they do not have to accept the instant decision of whoever assesses their housing benefit. A similar safety valve should be contained in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Government's argument against cluttering the statute book, people working to rule and so on, but financial pressure will be placed on local authorities in future. They will examine the law to see what they have to do, and what they do not have to do. The Bill and other legislation places certain obligations on them which they cannot avoid. My hon. Friend the Minister outlined the duties that she hopes local authorities will undertake. She expects them to do certain things and she will reinforce such obligations by guidance. If, however, local authorities have to decide between breaking the law or spending too much, clearly they will stay within the law and not undertake the obligations that my hon. Friend has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are dangers in omitting some provisions, but not others, from the statute book, especially when other pieces of legislation that have nothing to do with the Department of Health place obligations on local authorities—for example, children's legislation. It is a risky strategy to put only some provisions in the Bill because important measures may be left out. We are left with the fall-back procedure in clause 44, which is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1057</span>
fairly dramatic weapon with which the Secretary of State can march in and direct local authorities to put matters right. By that time, the damage would have been done. We could build in to the entire process a complaints procedure that would avoid our ever reaching that stage. Although I understand my hon. Friend's argument, it runs the risk of local authorities saying, "We do not have the resources. We shall do only what we have to do, and we do not have to do that."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Dame Janet Fookes 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) anticipated correctly that I wish to speak to amendment No. 770.1 welcome and endorse the hon. Gentleman's comments about the need to establish a proper appeals system for people who are not satisfied with the local authority's assessment. I hope that the hon. Member will respond positively to the amendment because the absence of such a mechanism in the Bill makes the legislation deficient. Now is the opportunity for the Government to do something about it. The White Paper gives local authorities the responsibility for arranging for people's assessments and states:
	<br><q><p>"assessment should not focus only on the user's suitability for a particular existing service".</p></q>
I endorse that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wider issues are involved. They open up the possibility that people will not consider that the category into which they have been placed is appropriate. They should have the right to appeal against that assessment. The amendment sets out a three-stage, right-of-appeal process in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), and I hope that it commends itself to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Committee just one of the examples that the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux provided: a CAB in north Wales reported a 75-year-old client discharged from hospital after eight months. She needed help as she was still very weak; no social service help was offered and when the CAB rang the social services department it was told that the client would be contacted—if it was possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NACAB quotes other good and similar examples of people who should have the right to the mechanism suggested in amendment No. 770. The amendment also has the support of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, another body with considerable experience in these matters. The amendment raises a serious point, and I think that the Bill, from the user's point of view, would be much improved if the proposed independent right were built into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with amendments Nos. 645 and 683, as it would be good practice and common justice that the user should have his or her assessment or care plan—I am not sure which would be the more useful—in written form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a week ago I visited Birmingham and looked at the community care arrangements there. I was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1058</span>
impressed by the way in which the user was given a card explaining his care plan. Many carers say that users can accept a "No", but find it hard to live with a "Maybe" or other equivocal reply. Carers and users need to know precisely what arrangements are being made. Many users may be confused and have communication difficulties, and therefore I believe that there is an overwhelming case for them to receive information in writing. Of course, in some circumstances, for example when the users are blind, writing is not the best medium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not think that it is appropriate that such detail should be written into the Bill. It is an important part of good practice, and I have every reason to believe that once local authorities get the mechanism under way, they will ensure that those who are being assessed have their results in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) had suggestions to make about appeals, but the mechanism in his amendment is somehwat cumbersome and bureaucratic. I should like to spell out in a little detail what we are doing now. The social services inspectorate is currently undertaking a project to consult interested parties about complaints procedures, and it also intends to introduce guidance and promotion material. The inspectorate is to identify the essential ingredients of complaints procedures and methods of publicising them; it will examine monitoring and management arrangements for complaints, the means of implementing procedural arrangements, and all training implications. The study will lead to reports on the development of the work, and to further promotional activities to assist authorities to set up their own arrangements for complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, we are giving a high priority to ensure that local authorities have effective complaints procedures. Many Members of Parliament, and those who have been councillors, feel that we have represented the only complaints procedure in the past. That mechanism will no doubt continue, but we do not think that it is good enough. Local authorities must have credible complaints procedures. This is something towards which the Secretary of State would be prepared to use his powers of direction, and with that unequivocal and clear commitment to the written assessment and to the importance of convincing complaints procedures, I hope that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the information that the Minister has given on the current and planned activities of the inspectorate, and I agree that it seems to be a sensible approach in so far as it goes. There is a distinction between complaints and people having redress for their complaints, and her comments on the mechanisms and intentions of the Secretary of State do not deal with the most important point—that it is not enough for a complaint to disappear into some as yet ill defined set of national guidelines. More underpinning is needed to ensure that the individual will have redress. How will that key aspect, without which the whole idea becomes meaningless, be dealt with?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be right or helpful for local authorities to embark upon a cumbersome,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1059</span>
bureaucratic system of appeals at this time, when they already have many new proposals on their agenda. A well advertised and convincing complaints procedure is the right approach. I take the hon. Gentleman's point: it does not have the same potential effectiveness in every case as a comprehensive, bureaucratic, costly appeals system. It would not be appropriate to write such a measure into the Bill or to ask local authorities to take on that task now, when they are committed to ensuring that they have ready their policies for care in the community and their procedures under the Children Act 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that further response. Her argument is not about whether such a system is right or wrong; it is that it would be costly and bureaucratic and that local authorities have enough on their plate with other aspects of the Bill and cannot take on anything else, including individual redress. I shall not push the matter further. I shall simply say that that is highly specious argumentation and it is pretty thin ice for the Department to be skating on. I think that this will blow back in its face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this is the last group of amendments I shall move tonight, I had hoped to end on an agreeable note. Instead we must end on only a partially agreeable note. The Minister has said that she is in sympathy with amendment No. 645. I hope that we shall hear assurances later that written assessments will be part of the schedule associated with this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) about appeals. The Government should take them more seriously. The amendments may be cumbersome and their terminology may not be appropriate, but we are arguing for their principle. Assessment decisions will be crucial to the lives of thousands of people and they should have the right to object and put forward alternatives if they are aggrieved. I hope that we shall return to the issue, and we should consider the possibility of tabling further amendments on report. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 525, in page 42, line 12, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(1A) Where a local authority carries out its duties under subsection (1) above, nothing in that subsection shall give a power to that authority to give to any person other than the person assessed, or a person authorised in writing by that person or their authorised representative within the meaning of section 1 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act or a person holding power of attorney in respect of the person assessed, any information, details or documents setting out or describing or referring to the assessment of the needs of the person for services, or the decision about whether his needs call for the provision by them of any services."</p></q>
I have tabled the amendment so as to have an opportunity to inquire of the Minister what safeguards there are for the sensitive documents that will reveal a great deal about a client. We need to know that, even with the best will in the world, a care manager or someone else will not think that it would be beneficial to pass the information on to another agency. I am more worried
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1060</span>
about well intentioned benevolence than I am about malice aforethought. It is difficult to guard against malice, but it is important that there should be both training and safeguards against those assessments being made available to anybody without the consent of the person about whom they were written.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to supplement the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) by drawing attention to the fact that confidentiality is crucial for alcoholics seeking advice. That is why they often prefer initially to go to voluntary agenciers. They should be encouraged to seek help but they must be sure that the matter will be treated in confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends are right to stress the importance of confidentiality of the information obtained by social service authorities. That is why the Welsh Office and the Department of Health have set out ways to ensure confidentiality while enabling authorities to carry out effectively their social work functions in the interests of individuals. The guidance also draws attention to strictly limited exceptions where the law or the public interest has to override the general right to confidentiality. The statutory guidance was published in 1988 and is the working paper for the social services. It gives statutory guidance and was issued in pursuance of the powers of the Secretary of State under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. Local Authorities are therefore required to have regard to the guidance in carrying out their social services functions. The guidance also makes it clear that anyone who is given information must be asked to undertake to follow the guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I sympathise with the concern of my hon. Friends that information gathered in the course of assessments should be treated as confidential, the effect of the amendment would be to hinder the provision of services following assessment and that would not be in the interests of the person in need of care. The amendment would also, quite unacceptably, prevent disclosure in the wider public interest, for instance where disclosure would help to prevent, detect or prosecute a serious crime, or to prevent a serious risk to public health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social services authorities are required by the guidance to draw up a clear procedure for disclosing information, in accordance with the guidance we have issued. I am assured that the arrangements are working well. They will be reviewed regularly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing statutory guidance covers the points that worry my hon. Friend and I invite him to consider withdrawing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My purpose has been served. I wanted to be certain that the Government are fully committed to proper scrutiny of confidentiallity.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 785, in page 42, line 12, at end insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 786, in page 42, line 12, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"((3)) A person may be authorised to represent a person being assessed under this section, if—
	<ol>
	<li>the assessed person so decides;</li>
	<li>it appears to the local authority after consulting with any relevant persons or bodies representing the interests of the assessed person that it is in the interests of the assessed person to be so represented.".</li></ol>
</p></q>
</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with those who are being assessed but who are not able to represent adequately their own interest. The White Paper makes it clear that the options for care and support should be evolved in as co-operative a way as possible with the individual. That is what the amendment would ensure. The White Paper acknowledges that a person's views should be taken into account, but the Bill does not give much encouragement to that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not everyone is able to represent himself, either because he lacks confidence, or because he suffers from a ailment that makes it difficult to get over to those who are assessing him what would be best for him. The importance of advocacy schemes for individuals should be highlighted at this stage. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) is not in Committee, but I should guess that that matter is covered under the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. Other categories of people—those not necessarily registered disabled, but suffering from certain conditions requiring them to have an advocate to speak on their behalf—will not come within the remit of that Act, so will miss the similar safeguide that should be available under this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A nominated advocate could be someone from the local community health council, the citizens advice bureau, a neighbour or a friend. It is important, too, that the type of care and so on is relevant not just to the individual but to the needs of the carer. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is anticipating the implementation of sections 1 and 2 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986.1 cannot accept his amendments at this stage. We make it clear that the assessment should be informal, taking account of all those who support the individual user. We spoke at length about the role of carers and I endorse the principle that the carer should not only be an advocate for the user, but that his or her needs should be considered as well. I cannot accept the amendments as that would mean an additional formal burden on local authorities at a time when their priorities should be clear. By 1 April 1991, they must be able to undertake new tasks that will be entrusted to them and which they have eagerly anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1062</span>
If we give local authorities an enormous agenda, the ideal will be the enemy of the good. It will not be possible to achieve the outcome that I think the hon. Gentleman and I would share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the amendments were anticipatory of sections 1 and 2 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. Do we have a positive commitment from the Government on the date of implementation of those sections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Later amendments refer to that matter in more detail. However, until resources are available, the Government do not think that it would be right to implement those sections when there are even higher priorities for social services departments to undertake. None of us would underestimate the heavy burden on local authorities and social services departments, notwithstanding the enormous increase in social workers that we have seen recently. They have important priorities and we do not believe that they are ready and able to undertake this one at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we set the two ministerial replies against each other, they are not worth the paper on which they are written. I shall not re-open all the arguments that we have had many times before about the failure to implement those sections of the 1986 Act. When the Minister talks in her mild-mannered and reassuring way about anticipating that measure, it is rather like "Waiting for Godot" and we wonder when those sections will be implemented. I supported the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) and the Secretary of State for Social Security gave all sorts of commitments when we debated the Bill. A tremendous head of steam had built up among Conservative Back-Benchers and there would have been acute political embarrassment if the Government had not accepted that measure. Clearly, they accepted it cynically, with a view to neither early or effective implementation. Nothing has happened yet. Without such implementation, the Minister's comments are far from watertight and not in the least reassuring. However, I shall not push the matter further and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 716, in page 42, line 26, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"But which must include consultation with all relevant government departments including housing department.".</p></q>
The amendment gives the Minister the opportunity to respond to the observations made by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) about the need for consultation with housing authorities to be written into the Bill. I assume that the Minister will give us assurances about what will happen under the legislation. I have received two separate written answers from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales. He says:
	<br><q><p>"It is essential that housing authorities play a major role in the production of social care plans as part of the Care in Community

strategy to assist his process.—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 12 February 1990; Vol.167, c.9].</p></q>
In a separate reply about resources, the Under-Secretary managed to refer to the resources that are available to local authorities for the implementation of community care provisions without making a single reference to housing or offering resources. We need the reassurance that the amendment would provide. The White Paper refers to housing being
	<br><q><p>"a vital component of community care … often the key to independent living".</p></q>
Paragraph 3.5 states
	<br><q><p>"Social Services authorities will need to work closely with housing authorities, housing associations and other providers of housing".</p></q>
The principle in the amendment is already accepted by the Government in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Government accepted amendment No. 604, which will do the same thing, in the Scottish parts of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton said, it would be inconsistent for the Government not to accept my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is likely to be disappointed. I do not think that that will come as a complete surprise, as he has confused social care plans and assessments. Housing must be taken into account in an assessment, but not in the same way as suggested in the amendment. We discussed that matter on amendment No. 604, when my hon. Friend explained that the best way to move forward was with guidance and with good practice. Clearly, housing would be taken into account in an assessment, but not in the way in which the amendment seeks to do. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) has managed to muddle up plans and assessments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister reads his reply, compares it with the debate on Scotland this morning, takes note of the remarks of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and reads his two written answers to me, I think that he will be forced to agree that I am right. In order that the topic is not killed off, and in the hope of returning to it on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sat quietly all day, but am increasingly angry at the way that the Government have dismissed this important clause and the reasonable amendments that have been made by both sides of Committee in support of assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish to limit the duties placed on local authorities because they do not believe that they have the goodwill to undertake them. Nothing could be further from the truth. Social services departments are keen to undertake assessments to ensure that care packages meet the needs of individuals. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1064</span>
(Mr. Cousins) pointed out, the link between social services departments and health care does not feature in the Bill, and we must ensure that they are integrated. Furthermore, social services are reluctant to undertake duties only because they lack the necessary resources and staff. We shall discuss this in more detail when we debate ringfencing, but resources will be needed to match care packages to individual assessment and the requirements of those representing individuals seeking care packages must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to this matter on the Floor of the House. I am staggered that the Minister stated that she did not want sections 1, 2, 3 and 7 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 implemented, because departments did not have the necessary resources to undertake these responsibilities. What could be a greater condemnation of the Government than that they are not prepared to provide resources for essential requisites for disabled persons? Section 1 of the 1986 Act deals with the
	<br><q><p>"Appointment of authorised representatives of disabled persons."</p></q>
Section 2 with the
	<br><q><p>"Rights of authorised representatives of disabled persons."</p></q>
Section 3 with the
	<br><q><p>"Assessment by local authorities of needs of disabled persons"</p></q>
and section 7 with "Persons discharged from hospital" to be assessed for their future needs. If the Government admit that social services departments do not have the necessary resources to enact that legislation what faith can we have that the Bill will provide resources to meet the needs of people who require care in the community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to organisaitons such as the Crossroads care attendance schemes especially the one in south Manchester where Mrs. Dorothy Thompson organises care day after day, to ensure that people are not seeking residential or hospital care. That scheme receives no resources. I also pay tribute to city councils, such as Manchester, that develop elderly persons resources centres, one of which I opened only two weeks ago, to ensure that assessment takes place—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> You may laugh, Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must remember that he must address the Chair, not the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you are equally surprised, Dame Janet, that the Minister was laughing at an initiative taken by Manchester city council to ensure that people are assessed in the community, that resources are put into the community and that a new centre is opened. The thrust of their legislation will be limited because resources from money available to city councils from poll tax assessments will not allow developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must say that she will commit the Government to implement sections 1,2,3 and 7 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 and will ensure that resources will be made available. If she does not, we shall return

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was commenting that Ministers have not offered even draft guidelines about how the clause will operate. There is no regulation-making power which Parliament would have the opportunity of scrutinising. Little has been written into the Bill and we have been told that guidelines will be issued later. We are being asked to accept a lot on trust. Would it be possible to publish some draft guidance before Report? I would be happier if more information about the operation of the clause were given. There will be demands for that from another place and it would help those who must implement the legislation, who will not have much time to prepare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not discussed reassessment. People's conditions and needs change and that requires reassessment. I do not suggest that every patient be assessed, say, every three years, but it is easy to envisage a scandal in which an elderly or handicapped person came to grief through care that was no longer appropriate. Such a patient may have been seen from time to time by an appropriate person under a care plan but that would not be an objective reassessment. I hope that that will be covered in the guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) about the need for the Committee to see a document that would give some idea of the guidance that will be given to local authorities. We would happily accept that the draft guidance was several stages away from its ultimate form. That would help the interests—and I do not use the term in the sense that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has—that Committee Members represent. It is vital that we receive such guidance so that we can speak meaningfully and sensibly, relay our proceedings to those whom we represent and allow them to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given my hon. Friend the Minister notice of the short intervention that I wish to make.

assessment, yet those assessments are an important part of their professional skill and development and it is essential that the Bill does not undermine it. The professions are trying to minimise the damage, but budget holding GPs and community care plans could squeeze out an important part of their professional skill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will keep a close eye on that danger.'</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is fundamental to the Bill. The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) made many unjustified points. The Government have made it clear that adequate resources will be available. The Committee is comprised of individuals, many of whom can imagine further areas for development and expansion. It is important that, whatever the resources, local authorities make the best use of them, for the sake of the users and the carers, who will be given a central role for the first time. The key point is the misuse, or ineffective use, of resources in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister believes, as we do, that the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 underpins the commitment to a successful implementation of the Bill, yet admits that resources are not available to implement that Act, how can we be confident that they will be available to ensure that the provisions in the Bill can be successful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are consulting local authorities about the key task of implementing subsections (1), (2) and (3), and their cost. The Government are determined to entrust those tasks to local authorities and to protect them from the various obligations and responsibilities that hon. Members, albeit with good intentions, have sought to write into the Bill. We must give local authorities achievable tasks and not burden them with so many new areas of activity that they are bound to fail. The Government have taken initiatives about providing people who are released from a psychiatric hospital with a named case manager. There is widespread recognition that the successful campaign to release many mentally ill people from institutions has accelerated and that many are discharged without proper care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made the cheap remark that I had laughed at Manchester's initiative. That was a travesty of the truth, because I was actually smiling with delight at the excellent headway made by yet another local authority. The Committee has heard many examples of the progress made by local authorities. I paid tribute to Newcastle, Birmingham and Bromley—I showed no party bias. However, there is much to be developed. Hon. Members have understandably asked for draft guidance before we have completed the process. I hope that hon. Members believe that it is important to make headway with the legislation. It is right to make progress on the Griffiths report and tie it with our proposals to update and improve the Health Service. We are embarked, however, on a major programme of consultation with local authorities on specific local authority voluntary organisations, such as Crossroads, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I refer him to the letter that I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1067</span>
circulated which has beens sent to all directors of social services, which makes clear the detail that is going into the preparation of the assessment. To anticipate or cut short that consultation process—the trial areas, the projects and the pilot projects where assessment is being undertaken—would be both difficult and unfortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's assurance that her smile was one of pleasure at Manchester's resource centre.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the work undertaken by the social services inspectorate goes a long way towards dealing with the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims). I shall see whether we can come back with more detail, but we do not wish to tie the hands of local authorities regarding what is workable and achievable. I am a parliamentarian, and I agree that the deliberations on this issue are very important. We are entrusting the local authorities to undertake the work, and are collaborating with them to produce a usable tool. The White Paper, of course, has detailed information on the assessment process.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with issues that have been debated in Committee today. It is essential when examining the needs of an ill person to take into account the needs of the the carer. A local authority should make provision for both needs in the services that it discharges. It is insufficient to deal solely with the individual ill person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 735 raises the issue of consultation with the person or a representative. Full and adequate representation must be provided for. It is essential to ensure that that happens. The Minister may say that that will happen, and I am pleased that one of his amendments allows medical practitioners to be consulted in certain cases. That is right. Scottish law demands a fuller account because of the additional complexities of Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 737 deals with an appeal system that should established in the Bill. Individuals should

have rights to appeal. Those rights already exist in Scotland, where local authorities are familiar with appeals procedures in certain parts of their work: for example placement in schools under the Education Act 1981, and compiling children's needs. Why should that sort of appeals system not be established and provided for in the Bill? Our proposals are even better as they by-pass the sheriff, who is involved in some appeals under the Education Act 1981.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) may not be surprised to hear that though I have a good deal of sympathy with some of the sentiments behind the amendments, I am not in favour of setting up a bureaucratic and inflexible appeals procedure. Nevertheless, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that guidance issued on assessment will have regard to both the statutory and voluntary sectors, and of users and carers. It will be realistic and flexible. In so far as teeth are required for enforcement, it will be backed where necessary by the direction-making power of the Secretary of State. That should meet the sentiment of the amendment. I hope that with those assurances the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to say a little more about that. If I may say so, it is not right to confuse a carer with a person subject to assessent by the local authority. It is appropriate that carers' needs should be considered. Indeed, carers themselves may be subject to assessment, but it would arise from the fact that they were carers. I take the point that local authorities should consider carers' needs at the same time, but that does not need to be written into the Bill. It should be a matter of good practice. I shall certainly consider that when drafting any guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I hope that the Minister takes account of the fact that, for carers, respite care is one of the essentials of the service. It must be in relation to the person, not the carer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is again to ensure that having drawn up an assessment of an individual's needs, the local authority should carry out the needs higlighted. It is not enough simply to make an assessment. There should be a statutory obligation on the local authority and the Government to ensure that finance is provided to carry out the assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have personal experience of the matter. The registration of special needs for children in schools, under the Education Act 1981 imposes an obligation upon the local authority to make an assessment that a child needs extra tuition or needs to go to a special school and to ensure that those requirements are provided. A similar provision is necessary in the Bill. It would be most worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The heart of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is definitely in the right place. Once again, however, I am unable to accept his amendment. Although I have no doubt that every effort will be made to meet individuals' needs more systematically, it would be unrealistic to make the immediate fulfillment of each and every need a statutory requirement. I am sure that having recognised that, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point, but I emphasise again the obligation under the Education Act 1981.

My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) has aked me to apologise for his absence this evening. His mother is in hospital and he had to go home. My hon. Friend put a gread deal of work into the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986, and it is assumed that section 3 of that Act is already in force. It is not, but the amendment would ensure that it is soon brought into operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has already touched on this matter. The timetable for the implementation of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 has not been changed, except that, for the meantime at least, the provisions of section 7 will be superceded by those of the Bill that we are discussing. The reasons that were put forward by the Government during the passage of the 1986 Act through the House still stand good. I join the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) in hoping that the mother of the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) makes a speedy recovery. I cannot commend the amendment to the Committee and I hope that he will feel able to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 739, in page 47, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(5) Where a person is to be discharged from hospital or residential accommodation, after having resided as an in-patient for a continuous period of not less than six months, ending with the date on which he is to be discharged, the managers of the hospital or residential accommodation shall give written notification of that date to the local authority in whose area it appears to them that the person is likely to reside, as soon as is reasonably practicable, and the local authority shall decide whether an assessment of their need for community care services is called for.".</p></q>
The issues behind this important amendment have been debated before, but the popular view of care in the community is jaundiced by the disappearance into the streets of people who have been discharged from hospitals or from residential care. Nobody knows what is happening to them or where they are. Many slip into crime or, more importantly, become the victims of crime. The amendment would try to ensure that that happens no more. When a person leaves a hospital or residential accommodation, the local authority to which that person is thought likely to go must be notified. It may be the local authority in which the hospital is located if the person has no obvious place to go or it may be the local authority in the place where the person originally came from and which he considers to be his home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential not to repeat the mistakes that have been made here. The principle of the amendment must be accepted even if the words are wrong. The Minister may say that that will happen anyway and that it will be taken into account, but it is important to raise the issue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1072</span>
and to try to solve the problem. If we do not, the whole concept of community care will fall into disrepute. We must convince the public that people should not be in hospital or in residential care if they could be at home or in their communities living a normal life. If these people end up on the streets, that will bring this measure into disrepute. I hope that the Minister will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the principle of the amendment although I am not sure of the detail as it is presented. I spent some time with those who sleep rough in London. One of the things that emerged from my researches—I am still working on them—is that there is a weakness in our system. People are discharged from homes and mental institutions with no follow-up to ensure that they are integrating properly into society. We should be concerned about those individuals. I thought that the Committee might be interested to hear of the experience I gained by sleeping out rough with the people on the streets of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart said, from a sedentary position, that he had slept out on the streets of Paris, and I recall reading about the experiences of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) at Lincoln's Inn. In the face of such cross-party determination that I should accept the spirit of the amendment, I can do nothing other than give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. I cannot assure him that it will be written into the Bill because arrangements relating to the discharge of patients are not matters for legislation but for good professional practice where codes of guidance are more appropriate. However, I have every sympathy with the purpose of the amendments and am happy to give the Committee the assurance that its aims will be met by other means. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment on the basis of that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My only slight concern is that one assumes that there has been good practice in the past and that people have been well intentioned when discharging people from hospitals. If the Minister assures me that there will be better pratice in future, I accept that. It was during the Algerian crisis that I slept out on the streets of Paris and I nearly got picked up as an Algerian terrorist, but that was a long time ago. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 740, in page 47, line 30, at end insert—

	<ol>
	<li>another local authority having functions under this Act, the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 or parts I and II of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987;</li>
	<li>a Health Board;</li>
	<li>Scottish Homes; or</li></ol></p></q>
This comes back to the concept of care in the community as a multi-disciplinary approach which cannot always be performed by the local authority making the assessment alone. Sometimes that will be possible, but at others it will need to consult other organisations. We

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1073</span>
include housing authorities in that group, because housing is a broad matter and does not involve only the district councils but some sheltered accommodation provided by the regions. The island authorities are also involved. Scottish Homes has an important role to play, as do the health boards and development corporations which the Minister has not mentioned. They should have been included in his amendment, to which his hon. Friend the Member for Ealing Acton (Sir G. Young) objected so strongly. The development corporations for the new towns are also housing authorities.

There may well be occasions when local authorities wish to consult various bodies about the services which they can provide. Inevitably, requirements will be placed on them to consult others. However, as these matters are surely for local decision, they should not be written into statute. Perhaps consultation could be dealt with in the code on assessment. I am happy to give the hon.

I tried to talk to some my party colleagues about the shenanigans on the Floor of the House, but I have no encouraging news to report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I wish to take up a matter with the Minister which is a direct reflection on the amendment that I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1074</span>
tabled to the previous clause in relation to England and Wales. My question is about assessment and the right of authorisation on the part of people who want someone to act, represent or speak for them as an advocate. I should like to know the Minister's thinking on that matter, specifically in the Scottish context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to a matter which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) may have raised. I ask the Committee's forgiveness if he did so. It relates to representations which some hon. Members have received from Scottish Action on Dementia. My question reflects points which were made in debates on another clause that we debated this evening and it is about involving in assessments those carers who deal with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify those two points? I had wanted to raise them at an earlier stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not in the room earlier. We appreciate the good work that he was doing on our behalf. We do not have difficulty with the idea of people being represented, but writing it into the Bill as part of the process of assessment will result in additional cost and inflexibility. There is no reason why people cannot perform a representational role in the process of assessment, but it is not necessary to write such a provision into the statute. I hope that that meets the hon. Gentleman's worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to cost and said that he does not want the system to be too rigid. We are concerned about those people for whom advocacy would be important, such as those who are not so articulate or self-confident. Such people might not even know that representation is available. If a strict legislative provision is not put into the Bill, some local authorities will not provide such a service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. A formal right for making representations may not be necessary in several cases, but I accept the argument that it may be necessary in others and that there may be a failure in the system. I shall consider the matter when drafting the code of guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. My final query relates to the point made by Scottish Action on Dementia about the importance of involving the carer in the consultation process for assessment. Can the Minister reassure us about that, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the person concerned and his carer are involved in the process. It is a matter of good practice, but, again, it is not necessary to write it into the legislation. It is essential that rigidity is not built into the code of guidance, and that we do not involve local authorities in expenditure that could otherwise be directed towards providing direct care. A balance must be struck, and I have no difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share the hon. Gentleman's concern about carers. We shall make a grant of about £30,000 towards

the cost of a new office in Scotland for the carers' organisation. The Government attach importance to the role of carers, and we wish to ensure that it is properly taken into account. The organisation will play a important role, and I am grateful to the hon.

Clause 43 deals with the inspection of premises used for the provision of community care services.

A criticism of the present regime is that there is a perverse incentive for old people to go into nursing homes and residential care homes, and, once there, they are protected. The Government are now trying to move towards a spectrum of continuing care whereby elements of a package are gradually assembled, and there is no incentive or need for a person to transfer to a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it right to continue a system whereby a person who has moved into a home has all the protection of clause 43, but until he or she reaches that end of the spectrum they have no protection at all because the social services department cannot inspect or register the community care services? Many of them are intimate services and if they are to be provided to children, we would insist on some scheme for inspection. People in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1076</span>
social services departments are worried because they will have no opportunity to ensure that people in the voluntary or independent sectors who provide services have the necessary skills or qualifications, so cannot ensure that the elderly and the disabled are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 550 would build on to the existing scheme and extend into other elements of the care package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). Many voluntary organisations that provide—and are in some cases pioneering the provision of—community care services are worried that, without some requirement such as that in the hon. Gentleman's amendment, they will be undercut and unable to compete in the new provider market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not thinking only of residential provision. It is most important that the voluntary organisations that have pioneered high standards of service should not be disadvantaged by the lack of a registration and inspection system that would take account of their good work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given an assurance to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) that I shall not elaborate at length on the work being done to extend the arm's length inspection units, but they are about to extend their influence over local authority residential homes. I understand the worries expressed by my hon. Friend and by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) about the need for safeguards for the new forms of community care but I cannot accept the amendment. We do not think it realistic in the time available to take on yet another responsibility, but I can assure my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman that there are a number of ways in which quality will be safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first method will be in the placing of contracts, which will contain mechanisms for monitoring and for ensuring that quality is being secured. Secondly, the process of case management will ensure that those who receive community care will continue to have their cases reviewed. Thirdly, we are aware of the importance of local authorities establishing and promoting their complaints procedures to ensure that difficulties are dealt with satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the clause gives the Secretary of State powers to inspect premises where community care is being undertaken, particularly those premises that are not safeguarded by existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, but I assure him that we will continue to watch these services, and that there are in the Bill other safeguards to ensure quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment would correct a drafting flaw in the clause. The Minister may suggest that there is a drafting flaw in the amendment also, but this gives us an opportunity to raise a point that will not lead to a difference of opinion between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Sir George Young 	<i>in the Chair]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anomaly is not intentional. The results could be very different from what the Government intend. The phrasing of the clause is meant to help protect elderly and disabled people where such protection does not exist and allow access and inspection when, for instance, there are fewer than four persons in a property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows any person authorised by the Secretary of State to enter and inspect any premises:
	<br><q><p>"in which community care services are or are proposed to be provided by a local authority".</p></q>
That is clearly intended to look after people's interests in those circumstances, but the wording appears to allow inspectors access to homes in which elements of community care are involved. Presumably that means that people potentially open themselves up to the inspection process by accepting domiciliary services such as home help or meals on wheels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that ministerial guidance would recommend that such an interpretation would not be sustained, but those words bear a wide interpretation that could be acted on as a result of change in ministerial guidance or by an excess of zeal at some level of the process. Subsection (7) contains a more draconian element:
	<br><q><p>"Any person who intentionally obstructs another in the exercise of that power"—</p></q>
the power to inspect and so on—
	<br><q><p>"shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale."</p></q>
The Government's intention to protect people and ensure that access and inspection can be achieved in appropriate circumstances is worthy, but the drafting is defective. At this late hour, I do not want to start a long debate, but my hon. Friends and I want an undertaking from the Minister to examine this and perhaps to bring forward an amendment that would provide some constraint on the wide ambit of the clause. We want reassurance on that point, which could be a breach of civil liberties and protection of the home. The Minister would not wish that to be the result of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment deals with the inspection of premises used for the provision of community care services. I wish to establish whether the Government will make sufficient resources available for these provisions, which have important and far-reaching resource implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, there are about 100 members of the social services inspectorate. They have already had additional duties imposed on them by the Children Act 1989, and their resources are thinly stretched. Will there be enough of them to cope with the additional duties imposed by this legislation? What assessment have the Government made? If additional resources will be required, can the Minister give an assurance that the cash will be made available? As the Minister responsible for health in Scotland seems to be throwing largesse around late at night, perhaps his counterpart south of the border will do the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raise as a late substitute, for reasons which will be evident to the Chair, to move the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not protect the privacy and independence of people receiving community care services who are subject to inspections. The amendment would enshrine in the Bill an assurance that interviews and medical examinations, which are bound to be intimate processes, are undertaken only with the consent of people receiving community care services or, when they are not competent to give such consent, of their representative. That is a humane precaution and I hope that the Government will consider it seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no idea, Sir George, that I would not be addressing you in my reply to the amendment. Nevertheless, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) will do just as well. Members of the Committee can take that as they choose. In any event, the argument is the same. It is a good argument, but it does not hold water for pratical reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, social services inspectors would not force anyone. They do not do so now and they would not do so in the future. The hon. Gentleman's fear is unwarranted, but in homes where everything is not ideal, which is where inspectors should go, if this became an absolute condition, steps might be taken by unscrupulous people to pressurise inmates not to give consent in advance. There might also be difficulty if an unexpected investigation were made because pressure might be brought to bear in an unseemly way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be better to leave matters as they are so that the inspector is trusted to make his own judgment in such circumstances and does not seek to frighten the residents or to extract evidence without consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
