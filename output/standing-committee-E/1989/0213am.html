	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 742, in page 48, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The Nursing Homes Registration (Scotland) Act 1938 shall be amended as follows—
	<ol>
	<li>for the words "Health Board" and "Board" where they appear throughout there shall be substituted the words "Local Authority" and "Authority", respectively.</li>
	<li>in section 5(1) (inspect of nursing homes), for the words from the beginning to "authorised by the Board" there shall be substituted the words "any duly authorised officer of the local authority.".'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment is similar to some of the amendments relating to England that we discussed until late on Thursday. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who will reply, will be aware of the similarities, but it is recognised that in practice the systems for registration and other social service matters differ in England, Scotland and Wales. In the debate on Thursday, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Basically, we agree that the local authorities and health authorities would have to work closely together, not only on this matter but generally in the provision of services to people in the locality. Certainly in Wales we look to the local authorities to take the lead to set joint care plans, which is slightly different from the arrangements in England."
— 	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 8 February 1990; c. 853.]</p></blockquote>
That is a fair point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in Scotland believe that in this, as in other community care matters, the Welsh model sets a good example to the rest of the United Kingdom. The ingenuity of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and his stout determination to defend Scotland, will lead him to produce arguments different from the persuasive ones employed by the Under-Secretary of State for Wales on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require nursing homes to be registered by the new local authority inspection units, as residential care homes will be. As local authorities will be responsible for funding both types of home, it is important that an efficient and workable system be established— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can scarcely hear the hon. Member's speech because of the chattering that is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been told that the White Paper, which lay behind the Government's drafting of this clause, is about introducing a considered and rational approach to the management of community care services, and to
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
overseeing such services. We have been told that it is also about identifying accountability. But if split responsibility for registration is retained, it will be more difficult to have a sustained and rational approach, and to pin down accountability. Furthermore, if responsibility remains split between health boards and local authorities, wasteful dual registration systems will have to be retained, and extra liaison between registration staff in the two authorities will be necessary. From experience, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will know that some unscrupulous owners will be tempted to play one authority against the other by making the arrangement unacceptable. That is not a fantasy. It has happened under the existing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Committee intended to improve services that were not working as well as we would like. If the existing arrangements for nursing home registrations are retained, under the Government's proposed financial arrangements local authority staff will have to visit nursing homes to check on standards for placements purchased through the local authority, using funds from the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonsense to go to such lengths to unify and simplify the financial payment system for nursing homes, by bringing it within the responsibility of the local authority alongside the financial system for residential care homes, and yet to leave the registration system split. If there is no move to unify the registration system we shall be left with an awkward arrangement whereby the new arms-length and more objective registration system for residential care homes will not apply to nursing homes; and the old and less independent registration system will continue. That is surely unacceptable and inefficient, especially as we are all convinced of the need for arms-length inspections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it will be much more difficult to apply to nursing homes any new standards that might be introduced by the Government or by subsequent Governments following the Bill's enactment. One of the Government's reasons for not changing arrangements might be worries expressed by the medical professions. But, there should be no cause for such worry, as I would still expect local authority registration units formally to seek health board approval for the nursing component before finalising registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments before the Committee prove inadequate, and if the Government accept our principles, we should return to the problems of registration on Report. Our proposed system would be no different from the system under which local authorities seek the opinions of fire masters and building control and planning departments of district councils to ensure that proposed residential homes meet the applicable regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are advancing strong arguments. It might be said that we represent the opinions only of those involved in social work. We do represent their opinions, but support for our view goes far beyond that and embraces people who are involved in the Health Service and in nursing care provision. Of course, as we would expect, our opinions are supported by Age Concern (Scotland), as well as by many organisations involved in the Scottish working group on care in the community: for instance, the Association of Directors of Social Work, and the Church of Scotland (Committee on Social Responsibility). We are entitled to claim the support of the Psychiatric Nurses Association (Scotland), the Scottish Council on Disability, the Scottish Society for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
Mentally Handicapped, Alzheimer's Scotland, and, significantly, the Association of Scottish Local Health Councils. The group's paper, which is available to hon. Members, expresses our view. Among the organisations involved in that paper are Community Service Volunteers —Scotland and the Scottish Association for Mental Health. A significant body of opinion tells us that we should seize this opportunity to abolish dual registration. In the paper, "Care in the Community—Scottish Working Group", the group states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to ensure consistency, the local authority power to register residential accommodation should be extended to include nursing homes given that they will, after April 1991, be responsible for meeting the care costs of their residents."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would mean that like residential care homes, nursing homes would be registered by the new local authority inspection units as the Scottish working group advocates. It is important to ensure consistency in the quality of service provision. Given the pressures on local authority time, it is unlikely that contractual conditions with nursing home providers would be enforced strictly enough to check standards. Many professionals believe that the system of dual registration allows homes to provide a poor service. It is unacceptable that some establishments have been refused registration as residential care homes by the local authority, yet succeeded in being registered as nursing homes. In theory nursing homes should be required to provide a higher standard of service as they deal with vulnerable people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as having worrying implications for the quality of care, the distinction made between nursing homes and residential care homes is largely historical and of limited relevance today. The Bill gives us the opportunity to correct what is wrong. The amendment would avoid confusion and contradictions in applying high standards and would avoid wasteful duplication of effort. We are told that that is the Government's objective. Certainly it was the main thrust of some of the Griffiths report's recommendations. If our amendment is accepted, we shall have made considerable progress on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) has made his case well, but there is a distinction between residential care homes and nursing homes. They have things in common, of course. Nursing care is provided by health professionals and both need to meet health care standards. It seems appropriate therefore that the bodies that have expertise in that area, the health boards, should be responsible for the registration of homes—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Chattering is breaking out in the Committee. The hon. Member is entitled to silence, as is any other hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your protection, Mr. McWilliam. Nursing homes should, therefore, be subject to registration by the health boards, which are the experts. If the hon. Member for Monklands, West examines the Nursing Homes Registration (Scotland) Act 1938 he will find that it extends not only to nursing homes but to independent hospitals, which provide acute medical or surgical care. Local authorities have no skill or experience in providing nursing or more intensive care. A move towards local nursing homes and independent hospitals
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
being registered with local authorities would increase the number of staff rather than eliminate duplication, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. I therefore ask him to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed, as, I am sure, are my hon. Friends, that the Under-Secretary did not say anything. The Opposition have put forward a first-class case. In their first few sentences, Ministers almost always acknowledge that, but then invite the Committee not to accept our amendments. I find that rather sad, especially as this is a marvellous opportunity for the Under-Secretary to show that he is fighting for Scotland. I thought that I had given him the opportunity to do that when I explained that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales had correctly identified the different approaches in England, Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will know that in 1636 the English Government introduced a tax on dogs' tails. I suppose that he would call that a woof tax. It did not mean that the Scots felt any obligation to follow. On the contrary, two years later—I hope that I am not losing the support of my hon. Friends—the Scots invaded England and defeated them at the battle of Newburn. I was not there at the time, but the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) might want to testify to my accuracy. Perhaps some think that we have added insult to injury, because my Scots colleague the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) represents the constituency in which the battle took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted our argument, for the Opposition's policy has great support in Scotland. However, I shall be consistent. As I told the Under-Secretary of State for Wales recently, the matter is sufficiently important for the Opposition to consider returning to it on Report. For that reason, rather than because I find the Under-Secretary's argument convincing, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

May I appeal to you, Mr. McWilliam, not to leave the Chair while I speak to the amendment? I had an awful fright last week when I turned round to address the Chair, only to find that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) was sitting there glaring at me. I find Dame Janet quite frightening at times, but the prospect of being chaired again by my hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>863</span>
The amendment deals with the Opposition's worries about clause 38. It would exempt local authorities from their duty to arrange accommodation for people who are already resident in private or voluntary residential care homes or nursing homes. The clause will apply to them unless they are of a description specified in regulations, although it is not clear what those specifications will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much concern about clause 38. Let me give one or two examples. We discussed at length last week the problem which all hon. Members of Parliament have experienced in constituency cases of a significant shortfall in the funding available to individuals for the cost of private or voluntary care. The hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) cited the example of Florence Smith. We have all had similar constituency cases but, unfortunately, the Government did not satisfy us that the situation would change over the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about shortfalls in funding. The Department of Social Security clearly wishes to reduce its commitment to provide income support for people in residential care, and I am fairly certain that income support payments are unlikely to increase significantly over the next few years. If anything, they will continue not to keep pace with the increase in the cost of care, which causes all sorts of problems for people in private residential homes. 	<i>Care Weekly</i> has not been published for a long time, but it has given an interesting insight into the business problems of the private sector and, in particular, the problem of rising interest rates, which affect mortgage repayments on the homes, and inflation, which has a direct bearing on the costs which the homes have to meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gap between the resources available to people in private care and the cost of private care will continue to increase and more people will have to meet the shortfall. They cannot by law have a top-up from local authorities, or be accommodated by them under clause 38 if they are asked to leave because of inability to pay. What will happen to them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that there is sometimes a significant and marked change in the care needs of an individual in a private or voluntary home. We have all had constituency cases, no doubt—I have had many—where people have gone into a home with certain physical capacities which they have lost over time and then been regarded by the home as being no longer suitable for it. The home says that it can no longer cope with the person's problems. The normal procedure in my experience is that the local authority then offers the person accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred last week to the local authority sector being a dustbin for the private homes sector, when the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes)—who is now chattering to one of his hon. Friends—made an intervention. Unfortunately, many people who have been rejected by private homes do end up in local authority care. Under clause 38, the local authority would not be able to help in those circumstances. I am worried about what will happen to these vulnerable and dependent people when they are told by a private or possibly a voluntary home that their condition is such that it can no longer care for them, and that because they need more care than it can offer they should leave and find alternative accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be management problems in the home where the individual is. There may be a home closure because of bankruptcy, for example, which is not infrequent in the private sector. Many private homes, especially the smaller homes, work on a tight profit margin and many have gone
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
to the wall. It is a competitive area, and many homes find that they can no longer continue making the profit which they expected to make, for a variety of reasons. What will happen to the residents when that happens, or when something else serious happens to the home, such as a fire which may mean that it can no longer accommodate them? Who will care for those people? According to the clause, local authorities cannot give the help that they have given in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of amendment No. 643 is to enable the people affected to appeal to local authorities, although I accept that it does not provide a solution to the shortfall in income support payments. We need a genuine commitment from the Department of Social Security to deal with the problem cases. What criteria will the Secretary of State use in exercising his powers under subsection (3); and will flexibility be allowed in the cases that I have described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), and merely seek to draw attention to what is happening in local authority homes. As my hon. Friend said, many people in private homes have to move out when their condition deteriorates, because the homes are not equipped to deal with people who are very old and who perhaps become doubly incontinent. Often such people can walk when they go into a home, but later need wheelchairs. So local authority homes have become mini psycho-geriatric hospitals—small units that accept people who were once nursed in a geriatric ward—and whether or not that is suitable, it is a fact that parts of most local authority homes are now given over to such patients. Local authority homes have become dumping grounds for the patients with whom the private sector cannot cope, and that is the reason for many of the problems, including inadequate staffing levels. There is also the problem of placing such patients in rooms where they cannot be observed. The initial reason for geriatric wards was that staff could keep an eye on the patients and the patients were easy to get at. Now the accommodation for them is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the clause, local authorities will be unable to re-accommodate elderly and sick people who need a different form of accommodation, and unless the Secretary of State accepts this modest amendment, people who are frail, elderly and very sick will be left without any choice. The Conservative party is always talking about choice, so the right hon. and learned Gentleman should agree to my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I want to ask the Secretary of State what the regulations in subsection (3) will include.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) are going over much of the ground that we covered last week. On Thursday, we spoke at length about the arrangements under the new regime, and made it clear that people in residential homes on 1 April 1991 will be safeguarded under the present system. Some hon. Members argued about the advantages of the present system, but a new system of financing those in local authority care is needed, as the hon. Gentleman is aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>865</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that those already in residential homes have the security of knowing that their position will not be re-evaluated. An overwhelming priority is to safeguard the local authorities' position of ensuring that the needs of those who are new to the homes can be properly assessed and met. Local authorities should invest their energy in establishing the new system from the word "go". However, there is a regulation-making power in clause 38 to exempt certain groups from the arrangement. The groups that we envisage will be subject to the regulations are those beneath pension age who currently receive assistance from local authorities. That will also apply to those beneath pension age in nursing homes and in residential homes. Hon. Gentlemen mentioned the predicament of those in nursing homes: the proposal will improve their position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Wakefield would lead to what might be described as a novelty. It would be unpredictable and lead to a lack of accountability if an individual could choose whether to continue with the existing system of income limits or to go into the new system of financing placements. Apart from that, our fundamental objection to the amendment is that it is important to start the new regime from 1 April 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about two points: first, the Government's assumption that the local authority residential care sector will still exist as a safety net. I am anxious lest before long there will not be a local authority residential care sector to act as a safety net. Secondly, what criterion will the Secretary of State use in exercising his powers under clause 38(3)? That is the crux of the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's second point first. We shall bring forward regulations later in the year and continue to look at the position until the regulations are laid down. Our criterion will be to consider those beneath pension age in residential homes who currently receive assistance. There may be others who are not covered by income support protection—for example, those who are temporarily resident in a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existence of the local authority sector will be debated at greater length under subsequent clauses. Under the existing regime there is a major disincentive to a local authority to place any individual in a local authority home. There could not be a greater incentive to use the private sector than the present system of financing, under which the local authority does not have to find any resources. Under the new regime, which we shall discuss in more detail, once the housing benefit and income support contributions have been taken into consideration, the local authority will need to fill the gap between the cost of the place that it has purchased and an individual's means.

In terms of incentive for the local authority sector, as opposed to the private sector, the regime will mean a more level playing field. That is not to underestimate the ethos of our proposals, which is one of a mixed economy in care and the encouragement of the voluntary and private sectors. But we made clear in the White Paper that we envisage local authorities continuing as providers. The main difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's amendment is that it would effectively undermine the principles on which the new provision is to be established, and I cannot accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

not come within the Bill's terms. If their circumstances and condition became such that they were no longer suitable to stay in a residential home and needed to be transferred to a nursing home, would it still be possible for the local authority to examine their case?

If, on the other hand, his situation improved greatly and it was possible for him to return to the community, he would be able to apply to the local authority in the usual way for domiciliary or day care services.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was about the power of the local authority to assess that the fact that a person was in, say, private accommodation would not preclude its making an assessment that a person's health had deteriorated and he needed a different type of care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He would go through the various steps, which no doubt would include taking advice from different agencies. He would not be part and parcel of the formal assessment process that we expect local authorities to have established by April 1991. That is not to say that he would not receive advice or guidance, as at present. His position would be as now, with a number of people having contributed to the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation that the hon. Lady described would continue as at present.

present range of facilities in residential and nursing homes, and hospitals, will be adequate. If there is evidence that some individuals may become homeless or be caused severe hardship, there is scope in the regulation-making power to incorporate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not closing the debate, because we need to pursue this matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to save my remarks until clause stand part, but since my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) has opened such an interesting and wide-ranging exchange, and the amendment goes to the heart of the clause, it might be convenient for the Committee if I and other hon. Members who are similarly minded made our comments now. I think that my remarks will be in order, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we debated the subject last Thursday, but we are now on a different clause and the consideration before us is different from that before us last Thursday. The consideration now is that clause 38 excludes from the new arrangements everyone now in residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found part of the Minister's reply helpful in clarifying what the clause means although she did not reassure us about what will happen to these people. It is quite clear now, thanks to my hon. Friend's pressure, that the intention is to use the regulations primarily for those below pension age, who in any event now qualify for the right to a top-up from local authorities, and to exclude those of pension age. We are therefore talking about 100,000 residents in private residential care who are currently of pension age and in receipt of income support; they will effectively be excluded under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the preserved scheme would give those 100,000 people security. I think that those were the words she used, but she can correct me if I misheard her. I would welcome that, as it was an extraordinary statement. If the Minister had discussed with those people or their relatives the appalling gap between their income support and the charges for the homes, she would know that they would not recognise what she offers as security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone doubts this, the press release from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, helpfully circulated to Committee members since last Thursday, details a number of cases which would be caught by the amendment but would otherwise be left excluded and unprotected by clause 38. Let me give a couple of examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the case from Haslemere citizens advice bureau of a 92-year-old blind women who was discharged from hospital after breaking a leg which refused to heal and who was placed in a nursing home by the hospital. I have to tell the Minister that the flow of elderly people from private residential care into hospitals is directly
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
contrary to her thinking—the pressure from her Department is to get elderly people out of hospital and into private care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The elderly women was taken out of hospital, where accommodation is free—for perfectly honourable and understandable reasons: to release a bed for another patient—and put into a nursing home where accommodation was charged, which left her with charges of £100 a week more than her income support. She is currently meeting the gap with £30 a week from a charity and £70 a week from her savings. It will not be long before her savings vanish. If she is on income support, by definition she can have only a few thousand pounds in savings. Her savings will run out in perhaps two years, and as the citizens' advice bureau says, she has no idea what will happen then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the case of Mrs. Smith, who is 80. She suffered from a stroke and has since been living in a residential home. She is quoted by the citizens' advice bureau in the following terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am always worried about money and really feel I should not have to worry like this at my age. It would be absolutely shattering for me to have to leave this home, but my savings are running out and I don't know what I will do then."</p></blockquote>
There is a particular poignancy in both those cases, because I understand that they both concern constituents of the Minister. They could be constituents of any Committee member, because such cases exist throughout the country, but those are cases in the Minister's own back yard. She has an obligation to find a way in which to resolve their needs, and the needs of our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is relying on the notes on clauses, which say that regulations will be used if her constituent of 92 years of age or Mrs. Smith are about to be put out on the street and become homeless, it is not offering them security. Why should a woman of 80 or 92 in such a difficult and unstable situation be told that the Government will intervene when she is homeless and about to be put out on the street? They want intervention now to give them peace of mind, not to have to worry over the next two years about whether the regulations will be triggered in time to prevent them from becoming homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a serious problem and not a partisan issue. It is a human issue affecting individual constituents of all Committee members. It is ironical that for once—it will probably be the only time—the majority of the income support claimants are in the constituencies of Conservative Members rather than ours, because those are the constituencies which tend to have residential homes. For once, Conservative Members have a greater interest in the problems of claimants than we have, and it is much in the interest of their constituents to resolve this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the problem be resolved? I have to say in a spirit of comradeship to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield that I am not attracted to the method embodied in his amendment, because it would pass the burden of closing the gap on to local authority expenditure. Here, of course, we come to the sole reason why I imagine the clause is in the Bill. The truth is that sitting in Richmond terrace with his civil servants, the Secretary of State has obviously spotted that down at the Elephant and Castle, the DSS will be looking for the first available opportunity to lumber local authorities with closing the gap which the DSS is not prepared to fund. Therefore, he has written into the Bill—I am open to correction if I am wrong—a clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>869</span>
which prohibits the local authorities from making that payment and thus leaves the financial responsibility with the DSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and his advisers were probably shrewd in that analysis and having that anxiety, and correct to make provision which leaves the buck with the DSS. If responsibility for closing that gap were transferred onto the local authorities, it could cost £200 million a year and there would be no guarantee that the local authorities could meet the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logical way in which to resolve the problem would be to make sure that before we move into the new environment and new structure, the DSS is obliged to uprate the benefit and eliminate the gap, or at any rate to provide a realistic level of income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be convenient to the Committee if I say now that we have decided that since the matter affects the constituencies of every Member of Parliament, it should be raised on the Floor of the House and every hon. Member should have an opportunity to debate it and cast a vote in the interests of their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that we may retain the opportunity to return to the issue on Report, I shall not divide the Committee. I hope that when we reach Report we shall have produced another amendment that will commend itself to all parts of the House and to outside organisations. If the Secretary of State wishes to avoid a repetition of his miserable isolation of last Thursday afternoon, I strongly recommend him to take a drive down to the Elephant and Castle to resolve the problem with colleagues at the DSS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones (Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel compelled to tell the Minister for Health that she has it badly wrong. She implied that if a change occurred in the care needs of an elderly person in a residential or nursing home, he could be taken back into hospital. That simply is not practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, like the rest of us, will have had constituency cases such as the following case. A relative telephones, perhaps at midnight on a Sunday, at his wit's end because, on the previous day, a consultant has told him that he must find a place for an elderly relative in a residential home or nursing home who is to be discharged the following Monday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and her Department have not thought through such happenings. If what I described happened to me, it must have happened to every other member of the Committee, and, as the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said, perhaps to every Member of the House. I ask the hon. Lady, in the name of humanity and compassion, to reconsider the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can understand the Government's genuine dilemma of the escalating cost of providing care in private residential homes and nursing homes. The reason the Government felt compelled to cap the cost through the DHSS was the enormous explosion in the DHSs budget between 1976 and 1990. It was because of the structure of the regulations that the Government gave the private sector a blank cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessment that the Bill proposes does not take place at present. It is a financial assessment rather than one of need or care. At present, nursing home or residential home fees would be paid by the DSS, irrespective of limits. The Government now find themselves in a trap of their own making in their attempt to cap the explosion of costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>
They created the problem and now seek to ask other agencies to pull them out of it. The Government must not make elderly people pay for their mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel so strongly about this matter that I insist on pressing for an explanation of how the clause is to be implemented. It is not good enough to ask us to rely on the notes on the clauses because they do not answer our queries or tell us how elderly people are to be treated if the clause remains unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes the care needs of people change significantly. There is a distinct difference between the type of care that nursing homes provide and the care given by residential homes. By definition, nursing homes provide a higher standard of care than that required of residential homes. However, an elderly person in, say, a residential home may, due to age or infirmity, develop physical or mental problems which the residential home cannot treat. We have to take account of such changed circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many elderly people suffer in later years from Alzheimer's disease, from which they may not have suffered when they entered residential care. The regulations introduced by clause 38 should cater for this problem. It is morally wrong to use hospitals as clearing houses, as happens when people are sent out into the community. I urge the Minister to re-examine this issue and, if necessary, to return to it on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarthy and Skye)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and to the Clerk for resolving the delightful mystery of the two amendmnts No. 779 on the order paper. We have not yet begun to debate whether the clause should stand part of the debate, although the debate sounds like a clause-stand-part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain. The amendment is wide. Certain issues in the clause are not covered by it, but no hon. Member has yet spoken about them, either directly or indirectly. We are not yet debating whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate just had that feel to it, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take up some remarks that were made in passing by the hon. Member for Livingston. I shall be grateful if the Minister for Health will be kind enough to listen. They arise from what would have been the alternative amendment No. 779 had it found its way into the selection process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there scope for a local authority system of top-ups for those most in need? This is an issue which Age Concern, among others, has pursued. If the alternative amendment had been selected and accepted, a system might have been instituted in that way, so that in cases of specific need or individual hardship the local authority could make a top-up grant to a person's income and recoup it from the DSS centrally. Does the idea commend itself to the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston fairly highlighted the reservations and potential pitfals of such a system. However, it would be part of the system of care. Age Concern has said for some time that it is an avenue that could be explored. It might not have vast revenue implications, and it would move decision making one step closer to the person in need. This is merely an inquiry. I shall be grateful for the Minister's response.

	<span class='label label-info column'>871</span>
There is broad consensus among Conservative Members as well as throughout three parties of opposition that the issue must be dealt with. I recall last Thursday's debate in this connection. Perhaps on Report Ministers from the Department of Social Security will be in the House alongside their colleagues with responsibility for health. One frustration of the Committee has been that Ministers from the Department of Health say, understandably, that there is a substantial part of the problem for which they are not ministerially accountable. They do their best to respond but they do not have administrative control. Hon. Members on both sides of the House, not only in Committee, would find it convenient to ask questions of DSS Ministers. I suspect that in their hearts, Department of Health Ministers would find it a considerable relief if DSS Ministers could take some of the flak and provide answers to the legitimate questions that have been asked throughout this wide-ranging debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the cases presented to the Minister will make her think again. I have another, which I had intended to put under new clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One day, a woman came to my house with a bill for over £1,000 from a private nursing home. Attached to it was a threat that if it was not paid, her husband would be turned out. Her doctor said that her husband could not return home because if he did so she herself would be in extreme difficulty. To give the local DSS its due, it quickly considered the case to ascertain whether it could respond to the demand for £1,000. The case went across two borders—Rotherham and Barnsley—and two departments of the DSS. There was still a shortfall, irrespective of what the local DSS and the social services in Rotherham and Barnsley considered. It appeared that the woman's desperately ill husband would be turned out of the home, with nowhere to go. A case meeting was held by the DSS, the area health authority and the local authorities of Rotherham and Barnsley to see what could be done. I brought in the legal department to take the case to court if necessary. I am grateful to the lawyer involved, who gave his services free. The patient then fell and broke his hip, and was therefore hospitalised. That helped because it allowed time for the problem to be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless local authorities have some part in such cases, it will be a worry to the patient and to the family who feel helpless to do anything. Unfortunately, the clause will make it impossible for local authorities to participate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingstone (Mr. Cook) identified a key issue. Local authorities are not anxious to take responsibility for assisting the 100,000 people who are in residential care. It is crucial, as we said at our previous sitting, that there should be confidence that income support limits will continue to be updated and reviewed according to independent evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I drew attention to a recent debate on the subject. My hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) spoke most forcefully to the Under-Secretary at the Department of Social Security on the issue of income limits as they affect those in residential homes. She covered the grounds that are examined annually and spoke of the need for independent examination and evidence to establish appropriate levels. It is estimated that
	<span class='label label-info column'>872</span>
in many cases costs are covered, but the income support system was designed to contribute to fees, not to meet full cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston referred to my constituency cases, and I am aware of them. He spoke about the difficulty of some who are currently within the system and mentioned their expectations, anxiety and uncertainty. He should not argue that that is a ground for not saying that should the 100,000 be subject to reassessment, as that reassessment would create a great deal of instability, uncertainty and anxiety. One criticism of the existing system is that when people are placed in residential homes they are not assessed in terms of their needs. That could cause alarm and uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More profound is the point that local authorities wish to ensure that they can invest their energies in establishing a new system that can, to the highest possible standard, provide for the physical and financial needs of the local citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members mentioned a number of extreme cases in which individuals have become extremely frail and fearful about whether there will be anywhere to care for them. We shall consider whether the regulation-making powers have the scope to identify a frail group—not the overwhelming majority of those currently in residential care. That might be a way through. We shall have further discussions with the DSS about how to ensure that there is greater certainty and confidence that in future the needs of a particular group will be fully recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchlitfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate. I am sorry that the Government have not been more specific about the criteria that will be used under subsection (3). The Minister mentioned those under pension age or people in short-stay residential care. As my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay) said, vast numbers of people do not fall within that limited criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are ill prepared to face the shambles that they have created in community care. They do not appear to understand the implications of the proposed legislation in cases such as those cited by my hon. Friend and me. It is a matter of human concern to every member of the Committee, not a political point. The Government seem unable to respond to cases of need which arise in our constituencies every week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is right to say that amendment No. 643 is not the solution. As I said, the solution is in the hands of the DSS. The Government must come up with something between now and Report. We cannot accept excuses beyond that stage. As the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) said, there is no DSS Minister on the Committee. That is sad, because the issue that is before us is the direct responsibility of that Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a serious issue that affects many people. I am prepared to withdraw the amendment on the basis that Ministers from the DSS and the Department of Health will state the criteria on Report. If they do not, we shall return to the issue and force a vote on the Floor of the House, in the interests of the thousands of people who are directly affected by the present problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a key passage in the Minister's speech, she stated that it was important that income support levels were uprated in each future year. I suspect that if the amedment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) were incorporated
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>873</span>
in the Bill, the DSS would never again uprate the levels of income support. It would be happy to leave the gap as the responsibility of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annual uprating of income support levels does not help if what is uprated is ludicrously behind the present rate of charges. We seek action to tackle the immense, unrealistic gulf between the level of income support and the level of charges, not merely a guarantee of an annual uprating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a sneaking sympathy with the Ministers—it is an uncomfortable and unpleasantly novel sensation—as the representatives of the DSS, the villains of the piece who are responsible for having created the problem, are not here. I am glad that the Ministers who are here intend to have discussions with their colleagues at the DSS, and I think that we can be sure, as a result of our debates of today and last Thursday, that they fully intend to seek those discussions. Nothing strengthens a Minister's hand in discussions so much as a defeat in Committee, but the arithmetic of the Committee does not allow me to be confident that that option is open to my hon. Friends and me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn Ministers that unless there is some movement by the DSS between now and Report, the Report stage will be an unpleasant and uncomfortable experience for them. The outside organisations that represent the 100,000 elderly people excluded by the clause will undoubtedly make representations to Members, and those representations will be aimed less at Opposition Members than at Conservative Members, who represent more of the people caught in the trap. Therefore, I earnestly counsel the Minister to take the conversations seriously, and to seek some concessions from the DSS before we return to the matter in four weeks' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was watching the Secretary of State's face, and I hope that as well as talking to the DSS, he will give us a guarantee that a DSS Minister will be present on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there was any expression on my face; I was trying to be enigmatic. Clearly I cannot speak for my right hon. and hon. Friends, but as my hon. Friend the Minister for Health said last week, we shall pass on to our colleagues the sentiments expressed in Committee and have discussions about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A broad consensus seems to be emerging, in that no one wishes to shift the responsibility to local authorities. However, there is a problem in connection with the existing social security arrangements, and hon. Members want to be told that the Government are committed to an uprating of the relevant social security levels, in line with the various needs that have been identified this morning. In my view, the Government are already committed to an uprating of those social security levels, but I shall pass on to my colleagues the general dissatisfaction that has been expressed on both sides of the Committee. I doubt whether further legal powers are needed, and for that reason I can give no undertaking about further amendments, either in Committee or on Report. I have no doubt that DSS Ministers will consider the matter and attend the debate if they feel that that will help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Ann Widdecombe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidstone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad if no decision is reached on the amendments, because they relate to a matter that should be discussed on the Floor of the House. There is massive concern among hon. Members of
	<span class='label label-info column'>874</span>
all parties about the problems involved, and any amendment to the clause—in particular amendment No. 591, although I would propose certain modifications to it —is worthy of the consideration of the whole House. We all appreciate that income support is not supposed to cover all costs, no matter how high, but even where costs are reasonable—regional differentiations have a considerable bearing on them—income support comes nowhere near covering the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of income support, outside this very narrow context, is to enable people to maintain a reasonable standard of living—to eat, to keep warm, to clothe themselves, and to meet the ordinary costs of everyday living. So what happens when people are translated—through no fault of their own, but purely on health grounds—into an environment, a home, where the costs—those of staff wages, capital costs, and so on—are of necessity substantially more than the costs of day-to-day living in an ordinary environment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the purpose of income support is to enable people to meet the everyday costs of living, it should enable people who are obliged to enter homes to pay the ordinary costs of living in those homes. Surely that reasoning underlies the entire system. If income support falls manifestly short of the most reasonable charges, it is not doing what it should do, just as it would not be doing its job if it fell so low that people could not afford to live at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not seeking carte blanche for homes to charge what they like; we are asking that income support should do the job for which it is intended—to support the miserable income of pensioners plus severe disability allowance plus whatever, and increase it to a level at which people can live decently in homes that levy reasonable and fair charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members' sentiments have been made clear. I wish, however, to raise a specific matter of searing technicality, to which I hope that my hon. Friends will listen and respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will exclude many people from part III assessments, but I wonder whether certain groups, in particular younger people, will also be excluded from assessment under clause 42 in a way that will disable the local authority from helping them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with some hope to what my hon. Friend the Minister for Health said earlier about people under the age of 60 or under retirement age, but a specific issue has been raised with me in connection with drug and alcohol agencies, detoxification centres, and so on. At present, once a person has been dried out or taken off his or her immediate dependency, that person is moved to a second-stage housing, and it is quite usual for the voluntary caring agencies which do this work to ask local authorities to help with second-stage housing. I understand that that does not automatically come under part HI powers; it can be done under other powers. All that I ask fro is an assurance from my hon. Friend that she will consider whether those reasonable arrangements, which are conducive to the rehabilitation and return to the

community of people with problems, can continue, because in my view, they should do so. I am not too concerned about how that should be done, but I hope that it can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall need to know more about the clause under which care is offered to persons at the rehabilitation stage. There is nothing in the Bill to undermine the work of drug and alcohol agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asked whether special provision should be made in an emergency. We said that we would return to the matter when we debated assessment. The Bill will provide further assistance, because it will be possible to provide continuing assistance for people under retirement age in nursing homes. That has not been possible under the existing regime, and the people about whom my hon. Friend is worried will be exempted by regulations from the main provisions. I am sure that such people's needs will be properly recognised, but perhaps my hon. Friend will provide specific details to make absolutely sure that nothing in the Bill will undermine the work of drug and alcohol agencies, whose work I applaud and endorse. Many of them have experienced uncertainty about their funding, and I am sure that this structure will be more effective in assisting their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CHARGES FOR ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 779, in page 40, fine 27, leave out 'subsection (3) or'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment paper includes two amendments with the number 779, and I intend to speak to the one on page 661.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the wording of the amendment, hon. Members may not understand what it seeks to achieve. I shall, therefore briefly explain its intention, though, I am aware that intentions are not always achieved. The amendment would leave unchanged the system of charging for residential care in local authority provision, which dates from the National Assistance Act 1948.I consulted the Act last night and was impressed to see that the opening line of section 1 read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The existing poor law shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>876</span>
I only wish that statutes these days were as progressive and lucid as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 22 of the National Assistance Act sets out the arrangements by which local authorities charge for the provision of residential care. They may charge a standard rate, but can assess the residents' ability to meet that rate. Effectively, therefore, a flat rate which is subject to a rebate is charged. The clause replaces that arrangement with a different system of payment, which is explained in the notes on clauses as "allowing for more flexibility"—an innocuous phrase to which it is difficult to take exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn Committee Members that if they swallow subsection (3), they are swallowing much more than flexibility. As I apprehend it, the purpose of the subsection is to invert entirely the present method of charging for residential homes. Instead of levying a flat rate, and then assessing entitlement to rebate, the Government will have the power to impose a means test on every resident. A resident's income will be used to judge how much he or she should pay. Residents will be reduced to a flat-rate personal allowance, and in so far as anything will be standard, it may be the money that residents are left with, rather than the charge levied on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this, the Government are following the Griffiths report which in paragraph 6.39 recommends that
	<br><blockquote><p>"public finance should only be provided following separate assessments of the financial means of the applicant (using a means test consistent with that for income support)".</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 6.43, it continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the financial assessment showed that there was no entitlement to the income related residential allowance, the information collected should enable the social services authority to decide how much of the total cost of the residential care should be charged to the individual."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the local authority will be able to make a charge based on assessment of income, rather than a charge that it believes to be reasonable for the old person's accommodation. That wide-ranging and sweeping change should not pass without challenge. I shall question the Minister, and from her answers we can judge whether the Government's proposed system will allow greater flexibility or result in the institutionalisation of a further means test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not leave local authorities to decide how much to charge for their services? The Government propose in the clause to lay regulations which will stipulate the amount that should be paid for individuals, according to their means. Does the Minister seriously intend that the Government will specify by regulation that the same means test be applied by every local authority, and if so, what discretion will authorities have to vary it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the features of the past half dozen years has been the increasing extent to which the Government have centralised means tests and removed the discretion of local authorities to vary them, as happened spectacularly with housing benefits only a couple of years ago. Why do the Government feel it appropriate to have a centralised means test? After all, the rhetoric used to present the White Paper and the Bill to the public suggested that the Government were to allow local people to make local decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why cannot local authorities be allowed to make local decisions about charges for local services? Why is it felt desirable to have a national means test which every authority has to apply, irrespective of the cost of its local home and irrespective of its political judgments about residents' appropriate contributions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>877</span>
The Griffiths report states that the means test should be consistent with income support. The present income support arrangements leave residents with only £10 a week personal allowance as pocket money for toiletries, postage, newspapers, phonecalls and the incidental expenditure which is normal and which must be allowed to residents of old-folks homes if they are to enjoy a rich, stimulating and rewarding life, rather than simply vegetate in a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the unfortunate features of income support is the extent to which it does not meet the charges of private residential accommodation; often the £10 allowance is paid not to residents, but to the proprietor. Do the Government seriously propose to reduce the personal allowance of people who are not on income support to the same amount? If so, that could have a dramatic effect on the minority of residents in local authority old-folks' homes who have private incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most residents in local authority homes have no private means; the great majority are dependent on state benefits from which they retain the personal allowance. The reference to a means test consistent with income support worries me, because the income support means test is a test not only of income, but of capital. Indeed, over the past three years social security means testing of capital has increased dramatically, increasing pressure on people to dispose of capital assets in order to release revenue, which can then be counted as income. The ownership of houses in which they no longer live is of special relevance to people in old persons' residential care. As a result of the changes in April 1988, many elderly people in private residential care have found that in order to qualify for income support they have had to divest themselves of their house, which they wished to retain in the perhaps forlorn hope that they might return to it, or which they had retained to provide accommodation for a daughter or other relative; or had retained in the perfectly normal expectation of bequeathing it to the rest of family. Sadly, because of that change in the regulations many of those people were obliged to dispose of their houses and to make arrangements that they had never evisaged when they moved into residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to flag my serious anxiety about the idea of extending the test to the 120,000 elderly people now in local authority residential care. Undoubtedly, some of them will own a modest house in which they no longer live. Do the Government intend to incorporate a test of the capital means of residents in the means test that it is proposed to introduce under regulations? I want to press the Minister closely on that point. If that is the Governments intention, how will they protect the 120,000 elderly people who are already in local authority residential care? They entered it on the understanding that there would not be such a means test, and that their capital and property would not be taken into account when their liability to pay was assessed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the evidence that Age Concern has produced about elderly or disabled property owners who have gone into private care? When their resources were assessed, the person who lived with them—usually a son or daughter, or a carer—was
	<span class='label label-info column'>878</span>
rendered homeless, after years of caring, because of the enforced sale of the property, which was treated as disposable resources and assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point, which has had a serious impact on numerous people. When people have given their lives over—perhaps unwisely in retrospect—to looking after an elderly relative who needs their help, they are driven to considerable distress when they find that they are dispossessed and have no capital with which to purchase another home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has raised one aspect of the problem, and there is another. Local authority old folks' homes do much rehabilitation work. Occupational therapy is common in them. The final aim of the therapy is to replace old people back in the community. However, if their own home has gone, that objective is hard to realise in practice, and the main incentive that elderly people have to respond to the stimulus of the rehabilitative work is removed. Those important matters have a direct bearing on the welfare, happiness and security of the people in the homes and on their relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ask such questions in the light of the trend that we identified in the previous debate. We pointed out then that elderly people are increasingly being moved out of NHS-care hospitals and into social services care in local authority or private residential homes. That also represents a movement away from the provision of accommodation and care free of charge, towards making a commercial charge for accommodation and care. Under subsection (3), accommodation and care would increasingly be provided by the local authority, and would in turn be means tested. That would represent a movement from free entitlement into means-tested entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be extremely unwise for the Committee to swallow the subsection on the assurance that it will provide greater flexibility. Nor should the Government be allowed to write the provision into the statute book without being challenged, especially when they have no clear idea about its implementation. I hope that the Minister will enlighten us on the content of the regulations; that is what we fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter is complex and sensitive. When planning their lives, elderly people and families should take into account the fact that a house is an asset and that it is part of their total financial position. Often it is the most valuable asset that anybody possesses. I should not like the Committee to send out the message that the traditional assumption that a house should be passed on down the generations should be the normal way of considering a house in future, partly because in many cases we are talking about children aged sixty or more who have had their own house for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the difficulties of recent years have arisen because people with a considerable asset have hung on to it for traditional and sentimental reasons. One of the great advantages of organisations such as Age Concern and Help the Aged is that they help people understand the advantage of realising the asset that they have in their property. Ministers need to take into account the cases in which carers are liable to be made homeless because the house in which they have lived for years is in the wrong name. It is all very well to say that if the parents had been shrewd they would have passed the house over to their children 20 years before. People, especially the most
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>879</span>
vulnerable, are often not that shrewd. Often people mean to do it, on the advice of a group such as Age Concern, but the haemorrhage comes unexpectedly. It is inhumane for nursing home charges to be met out of a carer's only property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other problem, which is more sensitive and harder to solve. I have a constituent who, like many people, decided for sensible and humane reasons when his mother became infirm to buy a larger house so that she could live in part of it with the family and the family could care for her. They sold the mother's house and made the new house a joint ownership. Now the mother has had to go into a home, because the family is incapable of giving the 24-hour care that she needs. The man and his three growing children are forced to sell the house, which is in an area blighted by a railway line, and move into a much smaller one, which is inadequate for the children, because the mother's share of the house is deemed to be part of her capital. This is not an easy issue as I have explained; there are arguments that cut both ways. But we want an assurance that the Bill will provide for sensibly humane—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tackle the hon. Gentleman on that question? In the case that he gave us there was joint ownership of the property. Could not the constituent and his family have remained in the house, within the law, by selling in effect to themselves, at market price, the other half of the occupied house? They would have got a deflated price for it. A market value can be placed on the second half. The cash could have been raised in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in principle; in practice, the problem is that the family is mortgaged up to the hilt. It was beyond their means to buy the mother out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may be mortgaged up to the hilt, but the market value of the second half would be substantially less than it would have been if it were vacant. It could be a small percentage of the true value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The DSS does not accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be right, but it might be a route round the problem in so far as the DSS might be prepared to accept a formula for assessing the additional 50 per cent. valuation on the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply grateful for the hon. Gentleman's benevolent interest in my constituency. I shall make sure that every avenue is explored. Indeed, I have done that. Extensive correspondence has been exchanged and we have seen Ministers. If, however, I have been in default, I shall look into the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Bill is enacted, there will be room for sensitive interpretation of the requirement to count in the family property as part of the total assets so that we do not inflict entirely unjustified and uncompassionate hardship on people who, in many instances, have carried the burden which society, if it had recognised it earlier, might have been willing to carry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) misunderstands the nature of the present system. The minimum charges and personal allowance structure make for a standard system of charging people in local accommodation. Clause 39 would regularise that system and make it more comparable with a more generous system of means testing in the income support system. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
system dates back to 1948 and, since 1980, there has been an increasing discrepancy between the provision available for those in local authority residential care because of the means test and that available to people who depend on income support. The personal allowance available to people in local authority residential homes is less than the personal allowance available to people in residential homes who benefit from the income support systems. We wish to standardise that. Any discussion of the financial effects of the Bill would recognise the cost of bringing the two systems into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) would enable variable minimum charges to be provided to take account of the new system under which local authorities have to establish a charging mechanism not only for people in local authority provided homes but for those who are funded in the independent sector whether in a private or voluntary home. For people in the independent sector, the minimum charge will need to take account of the amount that can be raised through income support or through housing benefit. That is the purpose of a differential rate. For people in local authority homes, the system will be precisely as it is now, where the combined effect of minimum charge and personal allowance amounts to the retirement pension. The Government think that the present system discriminates adversely against people already in a local authority provided home. They will be better off under the regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and others have mentioned income support arrangements for the treatment of capital. There is not as sharp a distinction in this case because, once again, under the local authority system the house can be taken into consideration. We shall introduce regulations to give precise details of charging and ensure that all these points are clarified. I ask the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) to withdraw his amendment, which is not pertinent because the clause should lead to a preferable arrangement for residents of local authority homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Minister on a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). A person who has been in local authority residential care for a considerable time may return to the community and, as in the case cited by my hon. Friend, that is particularly significant when that person possesses a property. The local authority system has the flexibility to deal with such cases at present. I have some sympathy for the Government in that it is difficult to draw up regulations on these matters, but under the present system, one can respect the fact that a person's development may allow him to return to his own home. That option should be protected for a considerable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will that fit into the system that the Minister is drawing up? Ifa blockbuster system is adopted for all local authority residential care, under which the option of a return to the person's home is cut off, much of the capacity being developed in the medical system to restore the independence of people who have perhaps not been independent for a long time, and all the benefit from that, will be lost. We must therefore press the Minister on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These matters concern the way in which the social security system works and, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, a house which is owned—a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
capital asset—will be taken into account in the income support system. There is certainly no intention to change that. However, there is the question of whether the individual is temporarily or permanently resident in the home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not grasp the point that my hon. Friends are making. The truth is, and she knows it, that at present there is flexibility in the way in which local authorities assess the capital assets of people whom they have in their care. We have argued persistently in this debate that people in local authority care should at least have the opportunity to return to the community and to homes which they may well retain. In the way that the Minister presents her amendments and blames the social security legislation—if I may use that term, because that is what she has just done—she is, in effect, cutting off that opportunity at a stroke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to find a way in which the property of people in local authority care can be retained until they die, so that at least they have the opportunity to return to it. The means that we are putting forward to secure that objective may not meet Ministers' wishes, but there may be other means. One could perhaps defer the liability to spend those moneys until death and them perhaps relinquish the assets in the control of the person in care. At least that would retain in principle the right of the person to return to his or her original home. Is that not the real flexibility at issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all have had constituency cases of people who are not treated as part-time or irregular residents in terms of care provision by the local authority but who are taken in on a long-term basis and then, because of the good care provided, are able to return to their homes. We are trying to keep that option open. Cannot the Minister devise some means of ensuring that that can happen within the local authority care system? It happens today under certain social service authorities. They preserve the property rights of the people whom they retain in care. It is a deliberate policy, to ensure that places can be made available if people reach the required standard and can return to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister is operating now, once people are taken into local authority homes and are required to be assessed under the social security legislation in the way outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), they are locked into that provision. The places will not be made available for others who subsequently, it might be decided, have a greater requirement to be placed under local authority care while someone else could be moved out to his original home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am saying is that the Minister should show some flexibility and not hide behind the social security legislation, because that is what we are all trying to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are important matters, but it is a quirk of the 1948 legislation that that flexibility exists because mass owner-occupation amongst the elderly was not envisaged then. Forty per cent. of owner-occupiers do not benefit from mortgage interest relief, and the problem of the elderly owner-occupier is an important and interesting one. Here we are dealing with one small corner of the consequences of mass owner-occupation among the elderly. None the less, the 1948 Act has provided flexibility, so that an old person who enters residential care
	<span class='label label-info column'>882</span>
can be told that it is not necessarily a life sentence and that the full, harsh regime of the present income support regulations does not have to apply. That presents the opportunity for entirely new forms of care and personal development within care, which is precisely what we should be seeking to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a matter of Conservative or Opposition Members setting up a new version of the national Christian peasants' party, in which we say that for all time a person ought to be able to retain the rights to his own property. We are talking about what is inherent in the new treatments of many conditions which afflict elderly people, such as strokes. A measure of independence can now be restored to people who have suffered strokes, and with that can come a return into the original owner-occupied home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By a quirk of the 1948 regulations, local authority residential care can provide flexibility. What we seek from the Minister is an assurance that that flexibility will be retained in the new system and that the harsh regime of the present income support regulations will not apply to all the elderly owner-occupiers who may end up in local authority residential care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister further on the treatment of capital and home ownership. The hon. Lady said that local authorities can take the ownership of a house into consideration when assessing liability for payment, but the rest of it has to be capped, as it were. What worries Opposition Members and several Conservative Members, I think, is that the proposed regulations will make it obligatory that the local authority should have regard to the house. It may also be a retrospective obligation on all those who are currently in local authority accommodation, just as the change in the income support regulations in April 1988 was retrospective and hit all those who had previously entered private residential care. Local authorities would then lose their freedom to decide whether to have regard to an owned house, and they would lose also any discretion over how to take account of the value of the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) was interesting, and I think that many hon. Members will have stumbled across equally absurd situations. The common-sense way of responding to the dilemma to which the hon. Member referred is that there should be discretion within the system for the authorities to rule that an individual case is ludicrous and not what was intended when the legislation was drafted, and to waive the requirement for a capital consideration. But DHSS regulations make no such provision. Our worry is that the regulations envisaged in subsection (3) will place a similar straitjacket on local authorities. If the position in which the hon. Member for Mid-Kent found himself was unsatisfactory when he was obliged to deal with a Government Department imposing such a sale on a house, one can imagine what it would be like if his local authority in Kent found itself trapped by regulations requiring that constituent to sell up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for the Minister to invite us to look forward to the publication of the regulations as the right time to scrutinise the Government's intentions. We need to know before giving them the power to make the regulations what they intend to do with it. We need answers about the treatment of private houses. I ask for the Minister's assurance that we shall at least have an opportunity to debate the regulations. From an

	<span class='label label-info column'>883</span>
examination of the Bill it is not apparent that we shall be guaranteed a debate, as the Bill does not seem to provide for the affirmative resolutions procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has had little to do with the amendment. My understanding of the amendment is that it would not achieve what the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) seeks. This is an extremely complex area. We are discussing the extent to which and for how long an individual who may be the owner of a substantial capital asset should have that asset taken into consideration when being provided with public assistance for his care. It is important, when we bring forward our regulations, that we see what room there is for manoeuvre and discretion. Several hon. Members pointed out the increased likelihood of rehabilitation if a patient had the prospect of returning home. All hon. Members will know of cases in which it is clear that the property has been passed on to a son or daughter to avoid having a charge made on it. Local authorities are aware of that and they can place a charge on the property. But there is no wish to operate the clause in a way that would undermine the potential for rehabilitation, or to behave rigidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take this debate into account and when we bring forward the regulations, which will be subject to the negative resolution procedure the hon. Gentleman and others can pray against them and ensure that there is a debate. I repeat that the overwhelming effect of the clause is to improve the position of those who are currently in local authority accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the fact that a local authority could put a charge on property. Was she talking in legal terms when she used the word "charge"? Was she talking about a sort of debenture on the property, whereby a liability would accrue until death, with the money being transferred to the local authority after the sale of the property? Could that happen under the new arrangements in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authority has that power now. Under the new regime, as I have made it clear, the intention is that the assessment of the personal allowance should be aligned with that achieved by the income support system, because since 1980 people in local authority homes have been adversely treated compared with those assessed by income support means. As to the extent to which the property as capital should be taken into account, I have made it clear that we shall bring forward regulations. I have given a commitment to take into account the points raised in this short discussion and to ensure that there is no undue effect on rehabilitation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but could we preserve the old system as it relates to current charging policy, as the Minister has set out and apply it to the new system to be set up under the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could a charge system based on deferred payment on the death of a resident in local authority care, be built into social security legislation? I am not suggesting that the Minister should say, "Yes, now it can be done." However, she might consider the principle, because it would preserve at least in part, the position of local authorities which want to retain flexibility and the right to allow people back into the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an imaginative suggestion which the Minister for Health may
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
wish to consider, especially as the bonding of property which my hon. Friend has proposed will be involved in the Opposition's proposals to replace the poll tax. If the Minister wants to do some pioneering work for us in that regard, we should be interested to hear about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been very interesting, and I am glad that I started it. It has illuminated some anxieties which were not sufficiently well-known and articulated. The Minister has said repeatedly that the new means test will be consistent with income support. I lived through the changes of April 1988, and I was involved with monitoring, scrutinising and exposing them. I warn the Minister that cases of immense hardship were thrown up at the point of transfer. The hon. Lady should not necessarily be lulled into a false sense of complacency by the officials who advise her that the local authorities' test is more severe than that of income support. If she took the panoply of income support regulations, especially in relation to capital ownership, and dumped it on all local authorities, she would be stunned by the number of cases of hardship that emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly counsel the hon. Lady not to swallow the line that it is simple to take a means test off the shelf from income support and apply it to local authorities. If she does that, she must make provision in at least two regards. She must leave to local authorities a degree of discretion wider than that which has been left to the Department for Social Security within income support. Local authorities need the discretion to respond humanely to people in local authority homes. They have a definite relationship and obligation to those whom they serve, and cannot be left penalising elderly people in the way that the income support changes undoubtedly did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed with interest what the hon. Gentleman said. Does he agree that when the strain of constantly looking after somebody is lifted, the person who has been doing the caring becomes temporarily infirm? When one adds the probability that the carer will lose the home that he or she has lived in for 40 years, one gives that carer the worst possible moment. The hon. Gentleman is searching for an assurance of flexibility for local authorities and others—who have to take into account both the carer and the cared for—to waive the capital rules if that would be in the interests of both clients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made an important point. It is well known from studies that those who care for highly dependent relatives are in a worse state of health than the rest of the population because of the strain of their relationship. It is equally well documented that the period after the death of the person being cared for is traumatic for the carer. Carers frequently require an extended period, often of years rather than weeks, to adjust to their new existence. To uproot them, in the middle of that period of withdrawal, from what has been the family home, and for them to be left with inadequate capital to find alternative accommodation, especially in the area of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), is to place stress on top of distress. We should protect the carers from that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must look with extreme scepticism at income support regulations and the way in which they relate to deemed capital assets. I have no difficulty applying a means test to a genuine liquid asset. I have great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>885</span>
difficulty, however, with some of the assets that are deemed to be available to the claimant, especially an owner-occupied house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is genuine about taking on board our debate, I invite her before Report to circulate a note to members of the Committee stating what the Government have in mind for the regulations. That would help hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who have expressed anxiety. The negative procedure is such that even I would not be guaranteed a debate if I prayed against it. It is not sufficient to rely on that procedure to protect our constituents. If it is necessary in the light of the note, it would be helpful if there were a further opportunity on Report to challenge the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are considerations which Ministers, especially those in the DSS, should re-examine. I can understand it if Ministers are anxious that a £200,000, £300,000, £400,000 or £500,000 house might not be taken into account when assessing a charge that should be paid under social security legislation. I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) that it is wrong that someone should retain such an asset yet somehow manage to secure care from the local authority without having that asset taken into account. The problem is that many people live in houses that cost perhaps £20,000 or £15,000 in industrial areas in the north of England. Due to the nature of the work that they did, they have to go into local authority care because their condition deteriorates as they get older. Many people in those circumstances have worked in industry or cleaning—many tell me that they were in service when they were young. In those cases, there is a to-ing and fro-ing over the years. If they leave care and go back into their own homes, someone else takes their place. But it is not regarded as short term. There may have been a medical change in their condition and suddenly it is decided that they should return home. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston and I are trying to preserve the right of those people to go back to their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston said, once the draconian powers under the social security legislation are in place, such flexibility will not exist because the property will have been sold. The solution is to find a way in social security legislation to defer the payment until the house has to be sold on death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the problem from a different position because of my views on inheritance, which I have always opposed: I have done so on the Floor of the House. I disinherited myself from my family's assets for ideological reasons. I do not understand why people should be able to pass on the substantial asset of a home that cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and because of the flexibility of a local authority, avoid an obligation to pay for local authority care. That leaves ratepayers to pick up the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that the state would not reclaim; in general I believe that it should. The question is at what point it should reclaim. It should not do so while there is the possibility that someone might be able to return to his own home, irrespective of the value. That gets over the problem of differential values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) that I circulate a note to members of the Committee about how
	<span class='label label-info column'>886</span>
we envisage that the regulations will work. We have had a useful and constructive debate about the dilemmas. Anyone involved in a means test will be aware of the complexity of the issue and our wish to standardise and achieve greater clarity. Ideally, one agency should operate on the same means test as another. That is clear in terms of the formal assessment of means and capital in the traditional sense. When a house is involved, there is more room for flexibility or manoeuvre. We shall have further discussions to see what progress can be made. No one wishes a major capital asset to be entirely overlooked when someone is supported long term at public expense and the asset is passed on to subsequent generations. We do not wish the system to be so rigid, however, that when there is uncertainty about an individual's progress and about whether he will move out, it undermines the possibility of rehabilitation. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) drew our attention to the importance of recognising the predicament of carers in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances, I shall withdraw the amendment. I understand that it would not do what I wanted it to. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) Persons who are provided by local authorities with accommodation under Part III of that Act shall, where they meet the financial criteria prescribed by the Secretary of State, be eligible for Income Support and Housing Benefit in the same manner as if accommodated in a Residential Care Home registered under Part II of the Registered Homes Act.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 251, in page 40, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'except that persons who are provided with such accommodation shall, where they meet the financial criteria prescribed by the Secretary of State, be eligible for Income Support and Housing Benefit in the same manner as if accommodated in a Residential Care Home registered under Part II of the Registered Homes Act 1984.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come to a debate that I anticipate we shall not be able to dispose of before lunch. The amendments go to the heart of one of the major flaws in the Government's proposed structure for care in the community. The amendments are intended to extend, to residents of local authority homes the same rights to benefits as are conferred by the Bill on the residents of homes in the private sector. The Minister for Health will no doubt enlighten us later on whether the amendments will have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tackle the major contradiction in half a dozen clauses on community care: that if someone goes into a publicly-provided home, he or she does not get public benefits. The right to public benefits is available only to someone who goes into a privately-provided residential care home. That is not what Sir Roy Griffiths ordered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have our anxieties about Sir Roy Griffiths' approach. He envisaged what was effectively a market care-in-the-community system, with a heavy reliance on demand rather than need. Nevertheless, like the practising entrepreneur that he is, Sir Roy offered a market in which competition would be fair and level. That is not, however, what is in the White Paper or in the Bill. Instead of a fair and level market, the market is rigged. The private sector
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>887</span>
will be subsidised from social security payments to about half the total weekly cost, while the local authority sector must bear its own full share of the cost of residential care in its homes. That is ludicrously unfair competition. It tilts the balance of advantage lopsidedly in the direction of private residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to Ministers, they openly stated their intention to rig the market on page 28 of the White Paper. One of the refreshing features of the Administration is that its natural arrogance after 10 years in power has meant that it no longer has a hidden agenda. Instead, it puts up its agenda in front, where we can see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is the agenda for the rigged market:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government wishes to ensure that local"— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) pays attention, he may hear what his Government intend to do before he votes against the amendment. The agenda is as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government wishes to ensure that local authorities have every incentive to make use of the independent sector when placing people in residential settings."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend will note the use of the word "incentive". It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities will therefore continue to meet the full cost of maintaining people in their authorities' own homes." </p></blockquote>
That is a penalty on local authorities for preserving their own homes, not an incentive. The rational response of the local authorities—the only response available to them—is clearly pointed out in the subequent sentence, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All authorities will need to review the extent to which they need to maintain homes of their own in these circumstances."</p></blockquote>
When I first read the proposal, which was trailed in a Government statement last July, I said that it would result in what I described as a Bradfordisation of local authority homes. I foresaw that the trends that had started in Bradford would affect other local authorities, which would be obliged to consider the compulsory transfer of their homes with the minimal consultation of the residents. That trend is now well under way, as is evident to anyone who watches developments in residential care. Local authorities of impeccable political credentials, including Newcastle, Manchester and Hackney, are now considering the transfer to the voluntary sector of their local authority residential homes. They have made it clear that they are doing so not because they wish to, or because they believe that such a transfer will advantage them or the residents of their homes or produce better quality care, but in response to financial pressures—what the Government describe euphemistically as an incentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the Government's talk about local people reaching local decisions. That is a clear example of local people being obliged to dance to the tune of a central policy, which nobody recommended to the Secretary of State, about which he consulted nobody, and on which no electorate has ever voted. The proposal is the fruit of the political prejudice of Conservative Members. It is totally ideological, and not, therefore, open to rational argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not however, relieve Opposition Members of the responsibility of seeking to enter into rational debate. I shall, therefore, ask Ministers several questions in the hope of teasing out of them a rational defence. If the Minister of Health pays attention, she may hear questions
	<span class='label label-info column'>888</span>
that she should answer at the end of the debate. She will have three hours over lunch to consider them, but she may find it helpful to know what they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what research have Ministers done that convinces them that if they impose a heavy penalty on local authorities to oblige them to transfer to the private sector, it will result in better quality care for the residents of homes? On the whole, the quality of local authority residential care compares favourably with the quality of private sector care. Both sectors include disgraces, and both include outstandingly good examples. But in run-of-the-mill provision, local authority sector homes compare favourably with those in the private sector. I have been round many local authority homes, and speak from experience. I noticed several months ago that Care Weekly gave its care home of the year award to a local authority home run by Strathclyde regional council. The opening sentence of the report on the award states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This award shows that despite their present financial difficulties, local authorities are capable of providing residential care of the highest standard."</p></blockquote>
Many local authority residential care homes provide occupational therapy for the rehabilitation of their residents. I challenge Conservative Members to name a signficant number of private residential homes that routinely provide occupational therapy for rehabilitation purposes. The last thing that the owner of such a home would want to do would be to rehabilitate the residents, as they would then return to the community. That is not a success, but a business failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, have not Minister's grasped the fact that many local authority residential care homes act not only as places for care for the residents, but as a focus for much wider social services for the elderly in their community? I have recently visited Alderman Clarke's old folk home in Norwich, which is a local authority home under threat from the county council of transfer to private ownership. I was impressed that not only were the residents against the transfer—they were extremely articulate in making their case—but that half of the audience at a meeting about it were people from the local community. They regularly used the home's social facilities for meals, and club meetings. The week before my visit they had all attended a Guy Fawkes' night party there. Homes provide an important amenity to a much wider population of elderly people than those who are resident. The activities are not run at a profit. Indeed, they are run entirely outside the cash economy. Therefore, they are activities that private entrepreneurs seeking to run the home at a profit would not continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, have Ministers contemplated the implication of the proposal for the training of people working in residential care? The private sector is notorious for its lack of professional training for the people who work in its homes. Such professional expertise and long-term experience as there is among staff who work in residential care has been gained within the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of training is underlined by the adventitious arrival on the annunciator screen of an announcement of a statement in the House this afternoon on training. I urge the Minister to attend that statement when the Committee has a break. She could then return and tell us whether there will be an obligation on the owners of private residential care homes to provide the type of training that is now provided by the public sector, and on which the private sector heavily relies. I suspect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>889</span>
that many owners of private residential care homes will be aghast at the idea of losing that pool of qualified and experienced labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, what evidence do Conservative Members involved with the Bill have that the private sector is even cheaper than the public sector? That question goes to the heart of the concern of Conservative Members. What evidence do they have that that transfer will not result in higher, rather than lower costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is not here as the director of social services at Tayside regional council has produced a report that compares public and private sector charges in Tayside. The director discovered that the highest cost in the private sector is £300, and the highest local authority cost is £211; that the average cost in the private sector is £175, and the average local authority cost is £160. The lowest cost in the public sector is also lower than that in the private sector. Even if the issue is viewed on the basis of cost, local authorities, which provide a higher quality of care while dealing with clients who are frequently more demanding, manage to provide it more cheaply.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities also, in effect, subsidise other areas of care provision by providing day centres, which are taken into account in those figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important issue. Of course, the private sector never attempts to provide respite care, which is also included in that comparison, and is also carried at a cheaper overall cost. The ludicrous result of the Government proposals is that Tayside will receive such a large subsidy to put its clients into private care that it will be cheaper to put its clients into the more expensive sector. That cannot make sense, even to Ministers who are concerned with value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the crunch question: whatever happened to choice? Ministers keep telling us that they are in favour of widening choice, yet this provision will remove the choice of local authority residential care. Surely people should be able to choose whether to go into the public sector or into the private sector. What happens to the choice of people now in the local authority sector? What choice will they have when homes are transferred over their heads from the public sector into another form of ownership?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>890</span>
I come to one of the main reasons why many people are worried about going out of the public sector. Elderly people may not wish to choose a private sector owner because the owners keep changing. I have with me—it is my last piece of evidence—an advertisement from The Sunday Times a week ago. The advertisement was placed by Johnson Fry Corporate Finance Ltd., and it advises readers to take a stake in the private residential care business. This is the advice that it offers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Probably the simplest and least risky way to invest in nursing homes is via shares in a Business Expansion Scheme …With up to 40 per cent. tax relief on your initial investment and no Capital Gains Tax on sale … it is hard to beat this way of taking an interest in the nursing home industry."</p></blockquote>
I am bound to say that it is not an interest that I would necessarily wish to facilitate or encourage, but I want to share with the Committee the following revealing passage:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Financially it often pays to buy a small home (say twelve bedrooms) and double its size. This gives an immediate 'development profit'".</p></blockquote>
Let us contemplate the position of people who enter that small home of 12 bedrooms. They have no interest in being owned by a business expansion scheme, and they certainly have no interest in seeing the home doubled in size to achieve a development profit, quite apart from the stress of having to live through 18 months in which their home has become a building site. I have no doubt that the clause will assist Johnson Fry Corporate Finance Ltd, and I have no doubt that it will stimulate people to take advantage of this helpful advice on how to invest in what Ministers plainly see as a growing independent private residential sector. But I see no practical reason why the proposal would be in the interests of the people at present accommodated in local authority residential care homes or of people who may wish to have the future option to enter local authority residential care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that, in the time available to the Minister in the next three hours, she will reflect on what possible practical justification there can be for this discrimination against the local authority sector, and if no such practical justification can be found, I advise the Committee that it would be wise for us to strike out of the Bill this piece of political baggage and extremism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
