May I ask, through you, that the middle door of the Committe Room be unlocked? That door exists principally for the convenience of members of the Committee, while the door at the end of the Committee Room exists principally for the convenience of the public, and it is a considerable inconvenience to members of the Committee that the middle door should be locked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 46, in page 2, line 17, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>(6) No order shall be made bringing the provisions of this section in force unless a draft of the order has been laid before and approved by a resolution of the House of Commons.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak to the amendments, I wish to point out that I am sponsored by the Transport and General Workers Union, members of which work
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
in the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to challenge the time when the clause will be brought into effect. We have attempted to do something more fundamental than amending the Bill's commencement; our aim is to prevent the provisions from coming into effect until Parliament has an opportunity separately to examine the question of timing, and a resolution about whether the clause should come into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We felt that is was necessary to deal with the matter in two stages—to consider the substance of the clause, and to give the House an opportunity separately to consider whether the clause should be brought into effect—for four reasons. First, the Government have no mandate to bring in the Bill and the clause as part of it. Secondly, the Government have undertaken no consulation on the Bill or the clause. Thirdly, we know that there is overwhelming opposition to the Bill and clause. Fourthly, the speed with which the Government plan to implement the Bill will, in our view, make this clause, along with the others, unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment, first, on the fact that the Government have no mandate. This morning, the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horhcastle (Mr. Leigh) said that this was a most important Bill—the most important Bill, I think he said—yet it found no place in the Government's manifesto at the last election. I challenge Conservative Members to show us any election address which stated that they wanted this clause, or even that they wanted the Bill. It is a Bill for which there is no public support, and the Government have no mandate for this part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government have undertaken no consultation. There were no consulations on the review that first floated the idea that local authority members of district health authorities should be knocked off those authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were no consultations on the review that led to the Bill. There was no Green Paper that would have allowed members of the public and members of the medical profession to discuss the clause. No views were sought from the medical profession. Nor, despite the rhetoric to which we are continually subjected about consumerism, were views sought from patients' organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should have consulted the medical profession and those who work in the National Health Service. It is arrogant and wrong to dismiss their views. That has enabled the Government to say that everybody who is against the Bill is against change. The problem is that they have not listened to those who work in or use the Health Service and who want change but profoundly disagree with the changes that the Bill, especially this clause, will implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all the Government should have consulted the organisations that represent patients. The amendments would give the Government the opportunity to consult the organisations that they so manifestly failed to consult before they came to the House to seek to put the clause into effect. There are many experienced and articulate organisations whose views should have been taken into account. The organisations which the Government should have consulted before seeking to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
bring the Bill before the House inclde: the British Diabetic Association; the British Epilepsy Association; the British Kidney Patient Association; the Haemophilia Society; the Migraine Trust; the Muscular Dystrophy Group of Great Britain; the Parkinson's Disease Society of the United Kingdom Ltd; the Royal National Institute for the Blind; and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. That short list of organisations shows the weight of experience and opinion that would be available if we had a Government who were prepared to listen to the views of outside organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There needs to be separate consideration of the timing of the clause because of the massive opposition to it. Doctors, nurses, midwives, the BMA, the Royal Medical Colleges and the Joint Consultants Committee had what they described as an "unprecedented" joint press conference at which Sir Anthony Grabham said:
	<br><blockquote><p> "The people who have been treating patients for the past 40 years have been denied an opportunity to express their concerns to our Prime Minister. I think that is significant."</p></blockquote>
Opposition comes not just from those who work in the National Health Service, though theirs is profound and widespread. Above all, it comes from the public. I shall quote some opinion polls that demonstrate that. A street ballot was conduted in Bristol by the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union. I hope that the Government will not scoff at the fact that I am quoting a street ballot. They themselves—significantly —have tried to avoid taking any test of public opinion. I hope that they will not scorn those who in good faith have tried to. The results of the poll on the Bill—the clause was one of the issues canvassed—were: 7,623 against: 98 for; and 29 spoilt ballot papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Jerry Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely what question was asked? It would be helpful if the hon. Lady would read it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give an undertaking that I shall bring into Committee the question that was asked in that poll. Other public opion polls show overwhelmingly the same opinion against the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman is hoping for a technical irregularity to save him, he ain't gonna get one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the hon. Lady that question because in my constituency the Labour party has done a number of polls. The sort of questions that were asked were, "Do you believe that your local hospital should be privatised?" or, "Do you believe that your local hospital should be able to opt out of the Health Service?" Such questions are misleading and the Committee ought to be reassured that the data that the hon. Lady is giving the Committee are 100 per cent. accurate and are not misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two responses to the hon. Member's intervention. First, will he present the Committee with the questions that he said were biased? It would be good if he could match my commitment by offering to bring chapter and verse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will he frame a question on the Bill which will not elicit an overwhelming majority against those proposals? If he could give an example of an unbiased question we should be interested to hear it. The Secretary of State has said that the Bill will give local people the ability to take big decisions in their own part of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
The clause is about local authority representatives on district health authorities. Last February the Secretary of State said that he would give local people more ability to take the big decisions in their own part of the service. However, whenever local people are asked, they have overwhelmingly given the thumbs down to the proposals. I have already mentioned the Bristol ballot, and shall now mention the Reddich ballot, which had a 57 per cent. turnout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bring the Committee that question. I issue the same challenge as before: you frame a question that you could ask people anywhere in the country that might possibly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady has forgotten in her enthusiasm that remarks must be addressed through the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Dame Janet. I challenge the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) to frame any question relating to the Bill that finds public support for the clause, or for the Bill. The questions are not biased; public opinion is against the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asks that I frame a question. I would ask the public, "Are you in favour of greater rights and greater choice for patients?" The response to that would be interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has read out the results from surveys. However, her whole speech becomes pointless if she does not have the questions that went with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Lady continues, I must point out that the amendment under consideration is narrowly drawn. I do not mind hon. Members making supporting arguments, but I suspect that we are now trailing off in a totally different direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the intervention by the hon. Member for Pembroke. He said that people should be asked whether they want greater choice. Indeed, they should. The Committee has to decide whether patients are to have more choice. We shall bring forward an amendment that will ensure that patients have greater choice. I expect, judging from the hon. Chairman's point, that he will support that amendment. In case he misses it, I shall make sure that he knows its number, and we shall sign him up as one of its supporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the opposition to the clause and to the Bill because it is the justification for our amendments, which, together, would ensure that the clause would not be brought into effect without separate consideration in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude the details of the Reddich ballot, there was a 57 per cent. turnout and 81 per cent. of those who responded were aginst the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that those figures are meaningless, and his Secretary of State shares his views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows nothing about the circumstances of the Redditch ballot. Redditch council spent a considerable amount of its community chargepayers' money organising the ballot. I advise the hon. Lady to read the leaflets that were sent to each household with the question. The leaflet explained that the ballot was about the commercialisation of the National Health Service and was so phrased that the percentage return that the council received must have been most disappointing. The proposals were described in such a way that it seems astonishing that such a small majority described their opposition to them. The trouble was that the leaflets were not an accurate description of our proposals. Therefore as my hon. Friends suggest, the results were no proper test of public opinion about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says that the Redditch poll was about commercialisation of the NHS. This is what clause 1 relates to. It refers to local authority representatives being knocked off district health authorities and being replaced by businessmen. The Secretary of State's intervention shows that he is possibly the most misunderstood Secretary of State in history. Responding to a Gallup poll commissioned by the British Medical Association which suggested that one in two Tory voters believed that the proposals were the first stage of privatisation of the NHS—only 15 per cent. of all voters approved of the changes compared with 71 per cent. who disapproved—the right hon. Gentleman said on BBC radio:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The poll shows that three out of four people are mistaken."</p></blockquote>
Opposition to the proposals has been widespread. I know that other hon. Members will speak about the opposition in their areas. The Government are in a way debarred from commenting on public opinion as they have made no effort to test it; they have pooh-poohed and denounced any such test as misrepresentation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Secretary of State how many representations were received in response to the White Papers "Working for Patients" and "Care in the Community". The answer was given by the Minister for Health on 19 December. Suddenly, the Government found it impossible to count and assess. The hon. Lady gave the most disingenuous answer. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"More than 13.500 written comments have been received on the Government's proposals to improve the Health Service. Many ask questions, many support all or some of the proposals, some only refer to specific aspects. It is not possible to distinguish them in the way the hon. Member requests."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 December 1989; Vol. 164, c.l71.]</p></blockquote>
Everyone else has managed to distinguish the tide of opposition to clause 1 and to the Bill. The Government are burying their head in the sand. They should accept our amendment and allow the House further opportunity to consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would have the effect of undermining all opportunity for co-operation between the Department of Health and social services. My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) will move an amendment that seeks co-operation. The clause will affect care in the community in particular because district health authority representatives from local authorities who are social services authorities will be knocked off the district health authorities. This is why
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
opposition has come from people in health services provision and from organisations that are involved in care in the community and have expressed grave reservations. The Government's only response has been to pretend that there is no opposition. A further reason for the Government accepting the amendment is that it would ensure a more measured pace of change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Secretary of State's absence, we asked the Minister for Health whether it was true that district authorities had been told to expect the Royal Assent to the Bill—therefore the change in composition of district health authorities—by May. The hon. Lady was frank. She said that she did not know the answer but her Parliamentary Private Secretary helpfully passed her a note on the back of an envelope that said "Parliament will decide". That is not the question that we asked. The Secretary of State for Health is present; he will be able to give us a candid answer. Is it the Government's intention that the Bill should have the Royal Assent by May and have the district health authorities been told? I hope that the Secretary of State will reply to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not discussing the Official Secrets Act, criminal investigation or commercial confidentaility. If the Secretary of State, who is responisble for a public service, has told public servants something, he should share it with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend press for an answer to that question now? The public have come to hear what we have to say; many of them will be unable to stay for the rest of the night, and I understand that we shall sit late. I want to know what undertakings have been given. I understand that some authorities have had discussions with departmental officials and have been given a timetable that is denied to Parliament. How can officials give information to district health authorities that we, as Members of Parliament, are denied? We are responsible for legislating. My hon. Friend must have an answer to her question now. The Minister knows what is happening and members of the Committee would like to know too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind members of the Committee that interventions should by their nature, be short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall allow the Secretary of State as long as he needs if he wants to explain the matter in an intervention. He looks as though he is getting to his feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only to save a little time. It is irrelevant to the debate between the hon. Lady and her hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made clear to the authorities what is plain and obvious to the Committee. Until the Bill receives Royal Assent, backed by the approval of Parliament we cannot make any changes to the composition of the health authorities to the status of hospitals; nor can we implement any other part of the legislation. The matter is in the hands of the House, and rather more in the hands of the hon. Member for Workington than those of most of us. The date of Royal Assent depends
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
on how long it takes for the Bill to go through both Houses of Parliament. It is not possible to give an exact date: I have never been able to predict with certainty when Royal Assent to a Bill will be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State failed to answer my question and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). We do not need a lecture on how a Bill becomes an Act; we have a rudimentary grasp of that procedure. We know that a Bill must go through both Houses and that then it receives Royal Assent. We did not ask about the mysterious process by which a Bill becomes an Act. We asked whether the Department of Health has told district health authorities that the Government expect and intend Royal Assent to be granted in May. Sadly, although the Secretary of State is responsible for a public service, he is dodging the question. He is not prepared to tell the Committee what he has told district health authorities about timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not ask about money to be spent in advance of the Bill, although that is important. We merely asked about the pace of change, but the Secretary of State will not share that information with us, which is a pity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Friend pressed the Minister, who refused to answer. He and his departmental officials are working to a date. Indeed, they have allocated the time for consideration of the Bill in Committee. That is why the Bill started with double sittings every Tuesday and Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They know the answers to our questions. The Minister talks about money being allocated, and the Government need the legislation before they can make the changes. We understand however, that appointments are being made to defacto family practitioner committees of the people who will be responsible for running the committees in future. Perhaps I am wrong—I am sure that the Minister will tell me that I am. Certainly, in the south-west health region major changes are happening which derive from the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will comment on what is happening there. It all relates to the timetable. How can we proceed with the Bill until we know where we are, when he expects it to be enacted and when he intends his instructions to go out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is becoming a speech, not an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the points that my hon. Friend made, especially about the south-west, and I look forward to hearing the Secretary of State's answer. However, I already have the feeling even a few minutes into the Bill, that we are not going to receive open and straight forward answers to the points that we raise, which so many people outside the Committee care about. Even the few people who are prepared to countenance the idea that there is some merit in some of the proposals believe that the pace that the Government have set for implementation is too fast. That is further support for the argument that there should be separate consideration before the Bill is brought into effect. Care Weekly stated in December 1989:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's target date for implementing reforms— 1 April 1991 —looks dangerously unrealistic. If the reforms are to get off on the right foot, they should be delayed until April 1992 at least."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
It is in order to have separate consideration of the pace of change, in addition to the substance of the change, that we have tabled the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party Select Committee on Social Services said that the Bill's provisions should not be implemented without running pilot schemes. The British Medical Association has argued for pilot schemes. Even Alan Enthoven who is credited with dreaming up some of the proposals, has been critical of the Government's insistance on rushing to implement the plans by 1991 without first having a trial. He has suggested a trial in a limited geographical area. The planned pace of change has been criticised even by those who want the changes to take place. The amendment would give the Government the opportunity at the outset of the Committee to show that they are prepared to mitigate the harm that they have done by not consulting the overwhelming number of the Bill's opponent's and to try to create what they so evidently lack: a mandate for the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In my experience, both as a civil servant and in the short time that I have been in the House, the uncertainty that hangs over a service while its future is being debated in the House is liable to damage morale, which makes decisions difficult, and makes the day-to-day operation harder. The point that the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) made about the timetable and about how disgraceful it was for civil servants and other officials to take a view on when decisions were likely to emerge is spurious. When I was a civil servant working for a Labour Government it was commonplace for civil servants, local authority officials and others working in that sphere to take views on when it was likely for changes to have to be implemented, to look at the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the point being made was twofold. First it was said to be outrageous, and secondly, the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who is not with us at the moment, said that it was impossible to proceed with the Bill unless we had a clear indication of what the Government had in mind. Clearly, the Government want to pass this legislation through the House as rapidly as is reasonable, and in so doing they are taking the prudent course of making sure that arrangements are in place to make certain that when changes are made they are in a position to implement them smoothly. That will include indentifying individuals who are able to fulfill the various roles necessary under a reorganised National health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Opposition's point is wholly spurious, and I urge my right hon. and learned Friend to press on with these desirable reforms and waste as little time as possible getting them through the House. The very volume of correspondence received by the Department and individual Members shows clearly that the public, professional organisations and many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Democracy is quite a messy business for the Government. Any talk about ballots and consultation leads to accusations of wasting time. It is a tragedy that the Government are now missing a unique opportunity to create a democratic management structure when, throughout Europe democracy is the watchword. Surely the Government could give a little consideration to the feel of the times? Instead, we get a Bill that will lead to a management structure composed of business men like many Tory Members. I use the word "men" because they will be in the majority. Such a management structure will be far less representative of the National Health Service that the presente one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is not only necessary for the whole House to debate these wide-sweeping changes but, before they are made, that the community, patients and staff employed in the NHS and other interested bodies should be given the right to a voice. Clearly, the Government are not going to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) said, the Secretary of State has no mandate to proceed with these wide-sweeping arrangements. Nothing appeared in any leaflet that I saw from the Conservative party in the 1987 election campaign. We can conclude only that the Government are frightened of ballots and real consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have tried to ascertain the
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
views of many interested parties. To be even-handed, even obtained the views of some of those appointed by the Government—for example, the general manager and chair of my local district health authority who follow the Government's wishes quite slavishly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham mentioned the House of Commons Select Committee. It was quite clear, especially about hospitals opting out of the DHS. It said that local people should be consulted before a hospital could become self-governing, as did the National Health Service consultants association and many others cited by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community health councils, which are the only really independent watchdogs, have not been consulted. But they have spent much time examining the proposals. My local one and the national body to which it is affiliated are worried that consultation has been sadly lacking. The views of the Royal College of Nursing, both nationally and locally, are that the lack of a ballot among its members is causing much anxiety and anger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a local representative in Calderdale. It is a tragedy, but I do not feel confident enough to name her. I should have done so a few years ago but unfortunately, because of the intimidation brought upon members of the NHS if they speak out, I cannot name her. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is the NHS we are talking about—everyone should have a right to a vote."</p></blockquote>
That is, not just staff but the public, and they should be given the information on the proposals. Indeed all the TUC-affiliated unions were against the lack of a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received some bizarre reactions from the general manager of my local health authority when I asked him about ballots. He professes to know what his staff feel on the issue of ballots. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At this moment the majority prevailing mood is one of indifference. The second most prevailing mood is one of concern and uncertainty."</p></blockquote>
When it comes to the people who have an opinion, he did not believe that they were in the majority. He said that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a ballot would not have made sense."</p></blockquote>
He felt that when the time comes for the public itself to be consulted it should be on the basis of an informed position. Presumably that is after all the decisions have been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least he was a little more polite than the Secretary of State in response to a question that I asked him on 25 July. I told him that I did not believe that his proposals had anybody's support. He replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clearly, the hon. Lady still does not understand them—and obviously she is not ready herself, let alone her constituents, to cast a vote on the matter."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—[Official Report. 25 July 1989: Vol. 157, c.842.]</p></blockquote>
Surely that speaks volumes about the Secretary of State's commitment to the democratic process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chair of my district health authority, Mr. Alan Templeton, is a supporter of the Government and makes no bones about that. When speaking about the ballot, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ultimate decision as to whether a hospital or unit becomes self-governing is with the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For people to vote they really should understand the issues and it could be a dodgy situation if a decision was made on the basis of, say, a 30 per cent. turnout."</p></blockquote>
He said that the Government themselves were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"empowered to take such decisions."</p></blockquote>
He, the Government's lacky, dismisses without any concern the democratic process. Perhaps he forgets that this Government were not elected by the majority of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Calderdale Health Concern consists of a group of voluntary organisations, the community health council, members of the public, and trade union members that have come together to go through the Bill line by line and fight it at every stage. It is a non-political body— non-party political, that is; everything is political when it comes to making decisions about people's health. It includes Conservative party members, and its chairman is a well-known Conservative supporter. It balloted the public of Halifax on Saturday 17 June, asking them to consider the Government's proposals on self-government and GP budgets, and to say whether they were for or against the proposals. There was a ballot box in the precinct—I went along to cast my vote—and the public were stopped, given a leaflet about the proposals and asked to say whether they were for or against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members want to see the leaflet I shall be more than happy to circulate it. There was one simple question on it. Of those polled, 97.6 per cent. objected to the Government's proposals. They were not coerced in any way; 1,045 votes were cast, of which 1,020 were against and 19 were in favour of the Government's proposals. There were six spoilt papers. The ballot box was sealed and local magistrates were asked to open it and count the votes. It may not have been perfect, but at least an attempt was made by that watchdog group to ascertain the public's views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Did the survey ask members of the public what they thought of GPs being unable to prescribe the necessary drugs? Did it state that drug budgets would be restricted? Did the question about hospitals opting out refer to opting out of the NHS, or opting out of local health authority control? Surely the hon.

I do not mind passing reference being made to other matters, but when such matters become the subject of the debate, and are outside the scope of the Committee, I have to draw the line.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have almost finished, Dame Janet. The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) will have a chance to vote on all the issues that he mentioned at each stage of the Bill, and he can vote on the amendment tonight.

We have a chance to consult and to ballot even at
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
this late stage, but I have no faith in the Government or the Secretary of State to do either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) mentioned balloting and consultation. It does not behove Opposition Members to lecture Conservative Members on the need for balloting. We have introduced balloting wherever we have been able, for instance in schools. Perhaps the hon. Lady could have told the Committee when ballots were previously held in the NHS. Were they held in 1948, when the NHS was formed? Were they held when hospitals were taken over by district health authorities in 1974? What would the procedure be? Who would be balloted? Would it be patients, who might be temporary occupants of hospitals? Would it be doctors? Which doctors—all those in the district? Would it be members of the public? Which ones? In Lincolnshire, for instance, people may normally use Linclon county hospital, but for some operations they may go as far as Nottinghamshire or Leicestershire. Are they to be balloted in those counties? In certain circumstances, for instance for major surgery, such as a heart by-pass operation, they may go to London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I presume that his action is part of Labour-party tactics by which it means to try to delay the implementation of this useful Bill. Such matters are extraneous and have no relevance to the amendments. It is only fair that a Conservative should set the recored straight about what happened in the past. No Labour Government have ever introduced ballots following their administrative changes in the National Health Service. They are not practical and they will not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) says that there were no ballots before the National Health Service was introduced in 1946. I was not alive then but history shows that the Labour Party's election manifesto was clear about its intention to introduce the National Health Service and that those proposals produced a clear Labour victory. That is the big difference between what happened then and what is happening now. Unlike the Labour Government in 1945, the present Government have no mandate for their designs on the National Health Service. They did not even mention their current proposals in their election manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party recognises that, fine as it may be in many ways, the NHS has many things wrong with it. There is a need for change, but we have been the party which, in the past, has stood by the central principles of the NHS.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hincliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have had a difficult day, Dame Janet, and I shall do my best not to make it any more difficult. I intended to speak to the amendments but I was drawn into the fray by the comments of the Secretary of State. He intervened in response to state that the proposals are not about the commercialisation of the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree. Last week, the district general manager of the Wakefield health authority, without any form of local mandate or consultation, introduced detailed proposals for opting out the authority's entire health provision. I refer to that action because the amendments deal with the public debate about the Bill's contents. The Secretary of State maintains that the Bill is not about commercialisation, but that contention does not sit easily with the detailed propsals put forward by the health authority for the area in which I have lived all my life. I care deeply about the NHS. It has existed all my life and I and my family have always benefitted from it. I want to see it remain as a benefit for future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It worries me that, given the importance of the paper presented to the health authority, the local Wakefield press was briefed before the health authority met to discuss the proposals. The press knew about the proposals before the health authority members did—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a rule of courtesy that when an hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hincliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My anxiety stems from the fact that, although we talk in the House about the need for public debate, the members of my local health authority were given 10 minutes to read a 15-page document with the most fundamental implications for the future of health care in Wakefield. Our Health Service is so management-dominated that health authority members are being treated with the utmost contempt by those who were appointed to their places by the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Health says that the legislation is not concerned with the commercialisation of the Health Service. Yet what other conclusion can we draw from the following comments in a paper that went to my health authority last week? The report, compiled by general managers, is written entirely in the language of the private business world. Page 2 of the report states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Concern has been expressed that any district not engaging in the new open market culture might become a Cinderella service of the NHS."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is already apparent that units identified for self-government are receiving preferential funding to strengthen their skills, resources and market advantage."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues, it seems to me that he is moving on to a topic that is not related to the amendment under consideration. There will be ample opportunity to discuss such matters when we debate other amendments and clauses, but this is not the right time to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your decision, Dame Janet. I am simply responding to the Secretary of State's comments. It worries me that local people in my constituency will be affected by a report sent to the health authority which has nothing to do with a public health service but is rather about the reorganisation of what used to be a public health service along the lines of a private commercial concern. That is precisely what the Bill is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report talks about "operating surpluses", but what about operating losses and the serious implications for treatments where losses in the new competitive market have been made? My central point — fully germane to the amendments before us — is that there has been no discussion whatever within the Wakefield health authority, yet thousands of people will be directly affected by these proposals. Services that do not make "operating surpluses" will be lost if the independent unit is unable to provide them. No consultation with public representatives who have been elected as either Members of Parliament or local councillors has taken place. Community health councils, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) referred, have not been consulted. Yet those councils are supposedly the patient's voice, established in 1974 by a Conservative Government to represent the views of the consumer. Why, therefore, have the proposals to which I referred not been discussed with the Wakefield community health council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no discussion with any consumer organisation of health care within Wakefield - not with Mencap, nor MIND, nor other numerous voluntary organisations that do first-class work in representing consumers of health care. The mentally-ill and mentally-handicapped — likely to be the Cinderella services under the Government's profit-oriented philosophy — will be especially affected as the same money cannot be made in that area as it can from certain parts of the acute sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about the views of staff. The Secretary of State has criticised myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax at least twice in the Chamber for attending a seminar that he held in Leeds some time ago. He was speaking about the reforms to district and unit general managers of the Health Service in various parts of Yorkshire. I and my hon. Friends the Members for Halifax and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) went along. We were not invited, but felt that we had a right to hear what was being said about our Health Service. We have a right to defend it and our constituents' interests. The Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
accused us of leaving the meeting early, but we sat there quite long enough. We heard an hour-long expression of concern for many senior managers, yet these are the people who will benefit from the proposals and will get performance-related bonuses for engineering the reforms. However, many of such people were themselves expressing concern about the views of those who were directly involved in implementing the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We got the impression from that meeting that many people in the NHS, even at senior management level, were not confident that the proposals had any meaning or relevance for the future of the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a copy of a report from the district general manager on that meeting. In paragraph 4(i) the manager, who is a Government supporter, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State made abundantly clear the Government's determination to implement the whole of the White Paper."</p></blockquote>
He says later:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Locally, we were asked to "cascade' the communications exercise through our own staff and have done so."</p></blockquote>
That brief report of one and a half sides shows that the intention was to have little consultation and that the exercise was one of telling people what they were going to get.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have given him the opportunity to come back into order, but I must be more firm about that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) dealth with the need for public debate and discussion and the need for a mandate on these particular proposals and the district general manager in my health authority has no mandate to bring forward such proposals. He has no mandate from anywhere, and I suspect that he has no legal right. That issue will doubtless be tested elsewhere soon. The district health authority has no mandate to discuss the radical proposals for the future health care of my constituents in Wakefield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Member of Parliament one comes to certain conclusions from one's postbag, and I am convinced that the vast majority of the public does not want anything to do with these proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an intervention in the speech of my hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"Do you agree with the Secretary of State's proposals as contained in the White Paper for reform of the NHS?"</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend will agree that those are the words of studied neutrality. I am not sure that the use of "reform" does not predicate the answer in favour of the question, but that question produced the result of 7,623 against and 98 for. My hon. Friend will accept that that confirms what he says about public opposition to these measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had nearly concluded, but my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) made the point that that fairly objective question, which might even have been biased in favour of the Government, received a clear response. I suspect that that response will be the same throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One draws conclusions from one's mailbag and I feel sorry for the Under-Secretary of State because he has the task of replying at least once a day to letters that I have sent to him. I have been fair to him, because I have not sent him the numerous cards that I received. He is a reasonable man and is doing his best. He responds when I send him letters and I send back those letters to the constituents who have written to me. Many of those constituents have stated that they have consistently voted Tory. They did not vote for me, but they will not vote for the Government if they continue to pursue the type of policies that are in this legislation.

I support the amendments because they deal with the views of those people who sent us to Parliament—that should be important to every Member of Parliament.

In considering the amendments, we are indulging in what is known in the excellent document entitled, "Labour's Strategy for the Committee Stage of the NHS and Community Care Bill", as "Amendment theme 1", which will
	<br><blockquote><p> "therefore, be to propose delaying the implementation of the NHS Bill until after the next General Election. In this way, we can ensure that everyone likely to be affected by the Government's plans has the opportunity to endorse or reject them at the ballot box."</p></blockquote>
These are the amendments that seek to delay beyond the next general election that implementation and all parts thereof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendments would be to delay the Secretary of State in discharging the present members of health authorities, as constituted under the National Health Service Act 1977. The Opposition are worried about those who presently serve on health authorities. They have mentioned at length the members who are currently appointed to health authorities by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promise that I shall not preface all my remarks with, "When I was a member of a health authority", or, "When I was chairman of the health authority", or, "When I was chairman of the social services committee", but all that is true and I want to bring my experiences to the Committee when discussing the value of the present composition of health authorities. I want to comment particularly on the value that members appointed by district councils have brought to health authorities. Many have contributed excellently—in the context of the White Paper, they brought skills and experience to the authorities not because they were members of local authorities but because they brought their own experiences, which they could use to contribute to the health authority's well-being and competent running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of local authorities to appoint has sometimes allowed the appointment of people who have chosen health authorities as a political battleground on which to fight the Government over policies that the Government have sought to implement through health authority managment. A great problem in the management of health authorities is that some members have felt themselves to be more representatives of the bodies that sent them to the health authorities than managers of the Health Service that they are supposed to be managing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1974, I was a member of an unbalanced two-district area health authortiy. As I wished to represent the people of Bexley and obtain better services for that part of the area, I took a rather parochial view. The authority was unbalanced; its 17 or 18 members were 3:1 in favour of Greenwich rather than Bexley. Inevitably, it became a battleground, which was undesirable. That factionalised the authority and meant that its management of services was consequently less competent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The comment of the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) on business men replacing local authority members worries me. The hon. Lady challenged me to read the White Paper; fortunately I was able to do so. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p> "Non-executive members will be appointed solely on the basis of the skills and experience they can bring to the authority."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
Business skills are not mentioned. Skills are not qualified; members bring a variety of skills and experience. Clinicians will bring clinical skills and knowledge to the authority. We must get away from the concept that the Opposition have offered to the Committee and to the public that the Government seek to commercialse the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Secretary of State for Social Security confirmed my comments? In the 	<i>Health Service Journal</i> of 24 March 1989 he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Business and commercial interests dominate the list of 21 new health authority chairs".</p></blockquote>
No one pretends that that is not so. The Secretary of State is on record in talking about commercial and business skills. I could bring a file of quotations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) mentioned councillors. Does he accept that a councillor who is a member of a local authority as well as of a joint consultative committee, particularly over the past decade, that has used joint finance provided by the Government to get people out of large institutions brings a great deal of experience to bear. Such people are unpaid representatives who give their time in caring about others in the community. A trade union representative on a trades council on a district health authority may bring more balance to a committee, because he will express the problems of working people. Surely that is important to the largest employer in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that interventions should be short. Hon. Members who want to make speeches must wait their turn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to respond to the hon. Lady. I accept that by sitting on a joint consultative committee a councillor may bring great knowledge. For one glorious month I was chairman of the health authority, chairman of the social services committee and chairman of the joint consultative committee. We agreed excellently with one another. However, that is not entirely a recommendation for continuing that practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that health authorities are managers of the services that they are appointed to manage—not that they should represent either geographical sectional interest or professional sectional interest. We are not setting up some form of LegCo on the basis of the present Hong Kong constitution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned to hear the hon. Gentleman re-emphasising the movement towards management in the Health Service as opposed to any form of local accountability. I assume that the hon. Gentleman, as a local councillor, has been involved in local advice surgeries, and I assume that, as a Member of Parliament, he has local advice surgeries, and through them he—like Opposition Members—learns about the difficulties that people face in using the local health services, and can raise with the Health Service the constituency issues that he picks up at the surgeries. I assume also that he receives leeters from members of the public. What concerns me is that the people who are moving in from the business world—as managers and as lay members of health authorities—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
have no access to that public opinion. They do not hold surgeries; they do not receive letters from the public. They are anonymous people. If they were asked to go on a public platform, they would run a mile. How do such people tune into public opinion and views on how the NHS should be run? How do they learn about the problems that face people in using the NHS as local consumers if they do not have the contact that the hon. Gentleman, as a councillor and as a Member of Parliament, has with the public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) continues, I again remind the Committee that we are going very wide of the amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying very hard, Dame Janet, not to stray, and I have not been tempted by interventions from Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Simple answer to the question posed by the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) is that health authorities are accountable to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State is accountable to Members of Parliament. There is accountability through this place, not through a councillor's surgery. A councillor is not appointed to represent the council. It is one of the great miconceptions that councillors sit on health authorities as representatives of their constituents and are answerable to them for what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to finish the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one of the great misconceptions. Management in the Health Service is very important. Its organisation is extremely complex, and requires skills that it has not always had in the past. If, in the past, councillors have shown particular skills in dealing with health and social services matters, it is very likely that they will be just the people who will be appointed in their own right to bring skills and experience to the new authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So long as they are members of the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would have to say that the Labour Government appointed many members of the Labour party to chairmanships of health authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude my remarks on local government representation by saying that I see a number of people coming in from local government and brining their skill and experience to these new bodies. There will be no great wealth of people wanting to serve on these bodies, and it will be important to garner all those who are able and willing to bring in the necessary experience. In my view, the Government have achieved a sensible balance in seeking to dispose of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
automatic right of local authorities to appoint members to DHAs and to have a non-executive brand of member who will bring his experience and skill, whether from the business world, social services—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative party local associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Mr. Roger Freeman): In seeking to respond to the points that have been raised, I shall start by saying that I intend to advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of clause 1 will be settled after a full debate in both Houses of Parliament. The objective of the amendments tabled by the Opposition is clearly to delay the implementation of clause 1 and the Bill. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) made that frank admission. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) rightly said, there is no justification for further delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Peckham, who said that we had no mandate to proceed with these proposals. I find that constitutional theory, arguing that there is no reference in our manifesto to a precise proposal, very strange. There is no necessary linkage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to give way to the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no necessary linkage in a general statement contained in a manifesto. Shortly I shall quote from our manifesto. There is no necessary linkage between the general statements in the Labour party's manifesto, in our manifesto and the precise provisions in clause 1 of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are fundamental changes to the National Health Service as we know it. They are massive, sweeping changes and is it not true to say that they came about because of a crisis in the NHS in 1988 brought about by severe underfunding? The Prime Minister cobbled together a few people who met in secret and did not consult any of the organisations or people with expertise. That process resulted in the Bill. Is that not the truth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating amendment No 48.I have just argued that the clause which seeks to terminate the memberships of old regional health and district health authorities is a detailed proposal. I cannot believe that the hon. Lady would seek to sustain an argument based on constitutional theory that that would have been an issue for debate in the last general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked me to refer to our party's manifesto and I am happy to do so—doubtless she has read it. In relation to health and social security issues, the manifesto states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our fifth principle is to strengthen management. The NHS is a large and complex organisation. It needs good management. It is not a business, but it must be run in a business-like way."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
That is a clear indication that we intended to strengthen the management proposals, which is precisely what clause 1 does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady then argued that we had not consulted and that the period of consultation was, by definition, short. I am sure that the hon. Lady will remember chapter 8 of "Working for Patients", a document which was published almost exactly a year ago. I draw her attention to chapter 8 on pages 64 and 65. For a year now we have had before the public and before Parliament specific proposals on health authority membership. The matter has been debated for 12 months by the medical professions, in the media and in Parliament. Therefore, not for one moment can the Committee be persuaded by the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Halifax that this is a rushed measure without proper airing of our proposals. It has been public for 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that the measures were unworkable, and so I draw her attention to the fact that our proposals for the reform of the National Health Service call for certain changes to be made on 1 April 1991. There is no big bang. There will be changes in ethos or attitude, and certainly in contracting, from 1 April 1991, but we need the new management structure in place as quickly as possible after Parliament has duly considered the Bill's proposals and the measure has received Royal Assent. Therefore, it is appropriate for us to terminate the memberships of the old regional and district health authorities as quickly as possible so that we can have in place, with the proper appointment procedure, the new authorities in sufficient time for them to prepare for the reforms before 1 April 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned matters being dealt with in a business-like way. Will he tell us what he means by "a business-like way"? What is the difference between his business-like way and the way in which the Health Service is being run now? Why cannot management duties be carried out under the present structure, as they have been for a considerable time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to explain, as several hon. Members have raised this important issue. There is confusion in district and regional health authorities. Their members do not know whether they are on representative forums, councils or management bodies charged with running the National Health Service. Some authorities have coherence. They look inwards to the management of secondary care services in their district or region with enthusiasm and care. They do not look outwards and blame everyone else when things go wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of authorities are confused about whether they represent their local authority a trade union or some element of the medical profession. In the interests of the Health Service, we must end the confusion about whether they represent someone else or share responsibility for running a health service, which is free at the point of delivery, with taxpayers' money. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay) asked what was meant by the assertion that it is not a business but must be run in a business-like way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
It is not the intention to appoint business men. My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) was right—we do not intend to appoint great rafts of retired bank managers to district or regional health authorities. We want people with a broad range of skills to be appointed on their merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those skills might be in managing people, in knowledge of the community, or in financial management, for example. There is a range of skills which would not require a monopoly of business men. No member of the Committee would want a monopoly of business men or retired business men on authorities. That is not our intention. It is not in the White Paper or in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept, as the Minister said, that areas vary. The people I know who sit on health authorities are there because of their expertise and interest, whether they are from councils or trade unions. The management structure of which they are a part represents the people of the area in which they live and provides management services for an efficient Health Service. I hope that the Minister can assure the Committee that such people will remain in their posts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that we expect appointees to the new authorities to be councillors who are not appointed because they represent a particular district authority or county council, but in their own right as experts, with skills who can—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As they are now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not as now. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that relates to another amendment. I shall not trespass upon the Committee's time or your patience, Dame Janet, by being drawn into that argument, to which we shall come shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill is enacted, councillors will be appointed not because they represent a particular council but because of their personal quality. The same will apply to trade union officials, perhaps to doctors and to a broad range of professionally skilled people. They will be appointed because of those skills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the appropriate place for the sort of representation provided by councillors and professional interest groups in the past when appointing members to authorities is at community health level and that consumer interest should be principally in that body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A later amendment deals with this subject, so I shall not trespass upon your tolerance, Dame Janet by answering the question, save to say that the Opposition's amendments are delaying proposals. We shall continue to discuss clause 1. Both Houses will debate the clause in great detail, so the amendments are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the amendment that would cause delay. It simply asks that the House of Commons be given an opportunity to debate a resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter is self-evident. The Minister is not an expert on the Scottish health scene but he will no doubt be aware that Scottish health boards are appointed entirely by the Secretary of State for Scotland. If he cares to examine the record of the past 10 years,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
he will see two things: first, a massive decline in trade unionists on boards and, secondly, a decline in the number of councillors on them, combined with a massive increase in the number of business men—especially those with Conservative party association. If that is the nature of health boards that the House looks for in England and Wales, why has the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland introduced in clause 25 proposals for Scotland to abolish health boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman accurately reminds the Committee that clause 1 relates to England and Wales but not to Scotland. He cited reasons.—No doubt we shall return to the matter when we discuss consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is wrong to argue that if the amendments were accepted—I am advising the Committee to reject them—and we returned to the matter on the Floor of the House, we would be debating something new. We would be debating precisely the same principle. We would not be discussing the appointment of the Secretary of State, the regional health authorities or the non-executive members of district and regional health authorities. The suggestion is to return to the point of principle now being debated. This is the Committee that will resolve the issue. I advise the Committee to resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While reassuring the Committee that we will not divide on the amendment, may I say that it is a pity that the Minister regards the fundamental democratic principle that his party put in its manifesto and which, broadly, the Government carry through, as abstruse political theory? The public regard it as common sense and as part of the democratic way of life. It is a shame that the Minister sought to write it off because it does not suit his political convenience. It would be much more courageous and candid if he simply said, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, "No, when the election was held, the changes were not planned or foreseen. We dreamt them up only when we came upon a cash crisis and decided that we would find any way out of it rather than deliver more cash." It is a pity that Ministers cannot be honest about the way in which situations are arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my hon. Friends, the Minister said that there has been loads of consultation, but the point is that the only chance people had to put their views was after the White Paper had been written on tablets of stone. The Secretary of State made it clear that the only people who were to be listended to were those with ideas about getting into practice quickly the details in the White Paper and that anyone with views on changing its substance was not to be heeded. That is not what we call real consulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ducked the question which I put as a written question to the Secretary of State and which was answered by the Minister for Health, about the level of opposition. He has not even had the courage to recognise that the Bill and this clause will be implemented in the teeth of overwhelming opposition. The Government's credibility will continue to plunge if people see that the Government cannot even recognise when they are profoundly out of touch with ordinary people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
I am grateful that we have had the oppportunity to debate this matter, but it has perhaps made us feel bleak about the prospect of having a realistic dialogue with the Government to seek changes. Nevertheless we shall not divide the Committee on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady seeking leave to withdraw the amendment or to have it voted upon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am a member of, and sponsored by, the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union, and speak in the spirit of the reasonable, logical and yet radical approach, which I know most hon. Members will asssociate with that union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon, we have heard several definitions of the meaning of clause 1. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), who decided not to give way to me, gave his definition of the role or input of local government. Perhaps he will no mind my saying that I was even more confused after his speech than I was at the beginning, but I do not intend to make further references to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so if the hon. Gentleman wishes, but that by no means reciprocates his attitude to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I should have given way to him but, unfortunately, I was somewhat confused by his neighbour to his immediate left, the hon.

Gentleman as I should hate to upset him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Confusion is something we always associate with the Conservative Benches, and why should this afternoon have been any exception?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to support the amendment. Among the many recommendations in the Bill, which are in many ways inexplicable given the Government's assertion that they are reforming and improving the NHS, is the determination to exclude local government from having any input. In any society that claims to be democratic, that is unreasonable and, in my view, difficult to comprehend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shape of the Health Service, in the light of the Government's inability to accept any views other than their own, is remarkable. On clause stand part we shall offer our comprehensive views on the clause, but it is extremely important for the Committee to recognise local government input over the years and the crucial role of social services departments, which the Bill appears to dismiss, and the potential for social services to continue to improve that input. That is in the context of a Bill, the short title of which specifically refers to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
National Health Service and community care. If local government is deliberately excluded, and social services departments' expertise, experience and day-to-day knowledge of dealing with problems is overlooked, how will it be possible for a Health Service to be efficient and responsive to people's needs?

Our amendment seeks to correct that, because whatever arguments the Government advance in support of the Bill, we believe that we cannot ignore the Griffiths report's analysis and the Audit Commission's evidence that there is a compelling need to ensure co-ordination between the activities of health authorities and those responsible in social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many problems, some of which my hon. Friends have referred to today. There has been a breakdown in liaison, because the role for social services in local government prior to the introdution of the Bill was minimal. In England, Wales and Scotland the Government have appointed perions who share the Government's political views and excluded those who have greater experience and more to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not advance the amendment in any limited party-political sense. We know that associations such as the Association of County Councils—not yet Labour controlled—is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the amendment and of our proposals. The ACC is usually cautious on such matters, so why does it say that the Government should recognise that it seeks to respond to the health, community and social service needs of 30 million people? It does so because it knows that the chaos that Sir Roy Griffiths identified in community care—or its absence—arises from problems that already exist in the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a case for crisis avoidance. The ACC is right to say, with other local authority associations including the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities, that if those in social services cannot have even the minimum say in policy formulation, they will nevertheless have to pick up the tab and are not happy about it. Those associations are entitled to ask how, in the absence of social services representation on health authorities, do the Government intend health authorities and social services to co-ordinate. What new way is to be found? The Opposition do not claim and nor, I suspect, do Conservative Members such as the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), that joint planning today is working 100 per cent. to our satisfaction. In the absence of social services input, joint planning will become even more difficult to recognise and even more impotent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will benefit neither the health of the people of Britain nor community care as we on this side understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apologies for saying that there is a need for accountability. The amendment reinforces that. The Minister said that the Government do not think that health authorities will be dominated by business men. We accept that that is Government's belief, but all their statements so far, including those made in the White Paper, seem to accept an imbalance in favour of those who support theory over those who see the need for best practice. I wonder if the Minister was thinking of
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
the patients, whose needs and rights are crucial. A few minutes ago, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"members will be appointed for their personal quality."</p></blockquote>
Who is to determine quality? Are not patients and their advocates entitled to a say? The amendment seeks to establish a minimum social services input.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr Campbell-Savours) has had a good day. I welcome what he had to say and hope that he will have the opportunity to expand on is view. I recall that, when I visited his very pleasant constituency, we met at the new MIND premises. Many people from social services in his authority were there. I would give great weight to their opinions about the running of the Health Service and see no reason why they should be deliberately excluded. Our amendment seeks to put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's Second Reading speech was consistent with what the Minister said today. He spoke about the need to find the best local people to ensure that the Health Service was run on business lines. If that is the case, why is the National Consumer Council so anxious about clause 1? Why does it support the amendment we are discussing this evening? Local government councillors are elected by the local people and they in turn elect social service committees, but we are told to ignore that machinery because the question is one of choice. Surely, then, it is appropriate for us to consider the views of the National Consumer Council, which has said:
	<br><blockquote><p> "Our recent work with elderly people with dementia and their carers has shown that the liaison between health authorities, primary care and social services departments is still, in some areas, poor. This has a detrimental effect on those users who may be in need of help from across the sectors and who would benefit from better and more closely co-ordinated planning."</p></blockquote>
The case for more closely co-ordinated planning is self-evident. If people are being discharged from long-stay psychiatric hospitals into community care which does not exist, the social services departments who respond to that problem ought to have a say in long-term planning within health authorities. Is that not what we mean by joint planning and the role of the consumer? The National Consumer Council, in support of the amendment, continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such co-ordination and collaboration have to become more formally recognised through the inclusion of a specific requirement on the face of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
We believe that that is right. It is a modest and not unreasonable requrest. It would not be resisted in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I mentioned an organisation with which I am proud to be associated — the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union. Previously, I was active in both the International Union of Local Authorities and the Council of Europe Municipalities. Representatives of such organisations would have been appalled at the suggestion that those in local government throughout Europe who were responsible for social services could not have a minimum say in their respective health services. Surely that would have been found as unacceptable for European democracy as the Government's proposals are unacceptable to us at present.

Many of the Opposition's arguments are not based only on our own experience of local government and the beliefs of our constituents as consumers. Many figures have been cited this afternoon. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) gave a figure of 97.6 per cent. against the Government's proposals. It might have reached 100 per cent. — it certainly would have in my constituency — on account of charges for eye testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill receives Royal Assent, somebody somewhere has to make sense of the legislation. The principal actors among those "somebodies" are members of social services departments. The strains put upon them — not least because of legislation, such as the Children Bill—are enormous. It is surely reasonable and logical for them to have some say in the long-term planning which clearly inputs so strongly into local policy formulation. If they are denied a minimum say, authorities and, even more important, patients, consumers and clients, will face even more serious difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholeheartedly share the deep concern of the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) about producing a Health Service and community care service that do not fit together like a well-made jigsaw puzzle. At present, there are considerable difficulties about boundaries running right through the gamut of caring services. If we consider the position of children with special needs who may be physically handicapped or of discharged psychiatric patients being quarrelled over by different areas of professional specialism, it is clear that the real costs must be attached to patient—or client-care when the structure is not properly meshed together. I agree totally with the hon. Gentleman on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real question, however, is what is to be the top group within the management of the National Health Service. If the scheme is to work well, I believe that that group must comprise those who have been, and still are, actively and successfully engaged in a main occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their role will therefore be to commission policy papers, take decisions on figures and policies choose good officials to serve them, ensure that proper quality control complaint mechanisms are in place and do everything else without which the NHS would fall to pieces, or deliver an even worse service than is now provided in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not necessary for that group to include, as a matter or right, various designated people. The BMA spoke to some of us only yesterday and said that it is possible for people to discuss a matter without realising that it contains a clinical component unless someone in the group has clinical experience. In effect, the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said that people can discuss an element of social services provision but not realise that it involves a social services provision unless someone present has experience in that sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a persuasive argument but it is not an overwhelming one. Most policy planning, organisational detail and matters that impinge on the day-to-day care of clients and patients will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
determined at levels below that of the top board. I hope and expect that members of health authorities in many areas will have social services experience, for the reasons listed by the hon. Member for Monklands, West, but I do not want the Bill to include a catalogue of people who are defined in narrow terms by experience. That is a recipe for ossifying the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My principal preoccupation with the reforms is that we should not enshrine for ever existing professional definitions, which have served, and still serve, their purpose in some areas, but which may become a straitjacket that will inhibit the development of new services. Only yesterday, I heard that a move is afoot to make it even more difficult for nurses working in residential homes to perform nursing functions in those homes. That would be a retrograde, rather than a progressive step. That is why I oppose the proposition that the category of person should be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) in his remarks on the amendment. He made a powerful case for the links that are needed between health and social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated the sittings motion, I said that I was worried about the layout of the Bill. By the time we reach clauses that deal with community care, the Bill may be guillotined. That would be serious. Nevertheless, I recognise that the earlier clauses on the National Health Service have a major bearing on the future of community care and the role of local authority social services. Clause 1 would mean the cessation of any formal relationship at member level between those serving on a health authority and those serving on a social services committee of an adjacent local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), before I came here I was a councillor serving on a social services committee. I was also a member of the local health authority although, unlike the hon. Gentleman, I was not the chairman. My views are not sufficiently reactionary for me to be invited to chair a health authority. My personal experience as a social services committee member and as a member of a district health authority led me to believe that involving people in both organisations at the same time is a useful exercise. One had a much wider vision of the implications of the policy decisions being made in both committees and could bring one's knowledge to bear in each committee. The ability to understand the implications of policy decisions on each side of the fence was important and helpful. It would be a matter of great regret if that were no longer the case. Many people have gained from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise the links between health and social care and the way in which numerous decisions made by a district health authority can impinge upon the provisions made by a local authority social services committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to my health authority's proposal to allow self-government to all health service provision in Wakefield, including community health provision I view seriously the proposed major changes in the provision of health visitors, midwives and district
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
nurses. Those changes will have an important bearing on the work of the local authority that has to work alongside individuals in the community. I worked as a team leader in social services and spoke every day to health visitors, midwives and district nurses. We worked very closely. No doubt we could have improved our relationship, but the Bill does not aim to improve it. Clause 1 will do the opposite, by removing the existing connections at a policy-making level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister to look at his Department's directives on child abuse. My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West said that we recently finished working on the Children Bill. That was an excellent experience and brought home the importance of examining how local authorities and health authorities work together on child abuse procedures. Inquiry after inquiry on child abuse cases where children have died has recommended that health authorities and local authorities should improve their work co-ordination. The proposals in clause 1 will take us a a step back on the progress made in the majority of local authorities on child abuse procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A district health authority's decision to close a hospital can have enormous implications for the local authority and for the social services committee. The junior Health Minister is aware of an example of that in my constituency. He was most helpful about the matter. A hospital had been closed and was to be sold off, but that had implications for the provision that the local authority hoped to make in its community care plan. We hope to develop that hospital and community care for the benefit of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When such decisions are made, the implications for community care and social services must be understood. It has been helpful that people have been in place in health authorities to make clear those implications for local people and for those involved in social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People should be aware of the implications of discharge procedures of any health authority in the acute sector, especially for mental health patients. The Minister knows of the problems that have occurred throughout the country as a result of the closure of hospitals and the discharge of mentally handicapped and mentally ill patients, and he will understand fully what has happened when the two authorities have not liaised properly. We have had the example of geriatric provision time and again. There is a need to co-ordinate the provision of the local health service with that of the local authority social services committee. I make a plea to the Minister to consider seriously the amendment as it relates clearly to important areas—particularly domiciliary provision—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
in local social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has not yet been raised that social services staff are employed within and seconded to health authorities. They used to be psychiatric and medical social workers. Now they are hospital social workers and execute a variety of functions. It helps them that their employers can also be on the health authority. It is important to bear in mind that local authority social workers are seconded to and work, rightly and usefully, within the hospital sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later in the legislation local authorities are required to bring together community care plans. I have met my local authority already and last Friday I met representatives of the social services, including some councillors who also serve on the local health authority. They were party to receiving the paper, to which I referred earlier, about the health authority opting out and having self-governing status locally. They are worried about what that will mean for drawing up care plans. Any form of care plan drawn up by a local authority must take into account and often include, the provisions that are provided directly by the health authority. There are many overlapping areas and it is impossible to expect local authorities to draw up care plans without appropriate dialogue with the local health authority about those plans. Local authorities must involve the Health Service and the prople who know what the implications of such plans will be in both areas. It is advantageous and common sense to continue to have DHA members who serve also on social services committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West pointed out, the Bill is termed the National Health Service and Community Care Bill. Any connection between the two subjects in the legislation is purely coincidental. We all know that the community care aspects of the legislation were tagged on as an afterthought—an illogical afterthought. Amendment No. 47 recognises the clear connection between the National Health Service and community care. It recognises the need for close working between local authorities and health authorities, whatever their future constitution. That is common sense and it is in the interests of the services that are provided throughout the country to continue to have local authority social services representatives serving on local health authorities, for the reasons that I have set out in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
