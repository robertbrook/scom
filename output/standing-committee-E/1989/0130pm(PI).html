<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should prefer the Minister to have replied at 11 o'clock this morning as that would have given us greater opportunity to press her on the details of how budget holders will manage their budgets. The Minister referred to the possibility of mid-year top-ups to budget holders' funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
Mid-year top-ups are an interesting proposition because discipline was the principle behind the introduction of family practitioner budgets. I do not object to the Minister's statement, but it seems that she has removed the discipline that the Government have consistently argued was necessary. If funds are to be topped up, budget holders will take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer that I require might be in the reply that the Minister gave earlier in which she said that such matters would be taken into account when subsequent years' allocations were made. The Minister should comment further upon that, because, of all this morning's statements, it is the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham, (Ms. Harman), the Minister's response to it and her earlier statement on topping up that will comprise the principal topic which GPs and the medical media will want to pore over. The Minister has departed slightly from the words used in the working papers and the White Paper. She should explain the form of the negotiations between GPs and DHAs to fix the subsequent year's allocation when GPs have exceeded their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my next point will be corrected by the Minister, if only by a blink, if I am wrong. What effect will the provision have on people who are eligible for free prescriptions? I see from the monitor that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) is replying to the debate in the Chamber, so the Committee has a further 10 minutes for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the load of free prescription costs becomes an excessive burden on budget holders, they may wish to rid themselves of the patients concerned. We can argue about the proposition that general practitioners may wish to rid themselves of such patients, but the taking on of a patient who is eligible for free prescriptions implies additional expense to the budget holder. Will the Minister clarify the position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the bunching of expenditure. The general view of general practitioners is that they are professionals in medical care, not business men. Many excellent family practitioners would not promote themselves or their reputations as good business men. A group practice which opts out might not manage its accounts as effectively as a general practitioner who does not opt out and is subject to what is, in effect, a monthly audit. At least the practitioner who does not opt out will be subject to an external discipline that monitors to what extent he is fulfilling the expenditure policies of the district health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Practitioners who opt out may not be especially good managers of money. They may overspend early in the year and, thus, be left with less resources for the rest of the year. If that happens, they may consider that, with the purchase of services that they are required to make, it is necessary to change the nature of the care that they provide to patients. They may decide to treat certain patients themselves, whereas in normal circumstances, they may have referred those patients, at cost to the practice, to a consultant or a hospital out-patients department. Therefore, a doctor might not wilfully set out to save money by not referring patients elsewhere, but might be driven to take such action as a result of not being especially proficient in the management of his expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper makes it clear that an allowance will be made to practitioners to

	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
administer their voluntary budgets. They will be able to appoint a manager, so that the circumstances to which the hon. Gentleman referred will not arise. Does he not consider that it will be to the advantage of general practitioners—for reasons that my hon. Friend the Minister will outline—for them to take on people who are chronically sick, most at risk and elderly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's second point for reasons that were outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham. As for his former argument, an additional budget may be provided. However, that does not necessarily mean that it will be effectively managed in the first year. The difficulties to which I am referring may occur in other years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</p>
	<p>4.55 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just finishing one point and about to begin another, but I revert to a point that I made about prescription charges. Who would be responsible for funding what I believe would be an additional cost falling on the budget holders in the event that they were to prescribe to people such as myself? As far as the law is concerned, I am regarded as disabled. I have had an exemption certificate since having an operation in 1983 for a condition from which I nearly died. The certificate allows me free prescriptions. My prescriptions include not only drugs but other materials that I need to sustain a healthy life. Perhaps I shall go further into my condition in a debate on another amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always known that my prescriptions were a considerable annual cost to the National Health Service as are those of the other 8,000 people with the same condition. The new budget holders will not be required to fund any part of the additional expenditure arising out of exemption certificates. If there is an arrangement, can it be explained in such a way that general practitioners will not be inclined to rid themselves of patients like me while the Bill is being examined in Parliament? I know that my general practitioner would not wish to be rid of me, but others might want to lose patients if they thought that an unreasonable level of expenditure would fall on their budgets, creating the problems outlined in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I address myself to an issue dealt with by the Minister for Health in her winding-up speech. She said that the arrangement was voluntary and that general practitioners would have the right to choose. I put it to the hon. Lady that they do not have the right to choose. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) drew attention to the different treatments that practices are able to provide. An opted-out practice—a budget holding practice—would have the right to refer to whomever the practice wished, depending on the contract that it had with the authority. But a practitioner who had not opted out would be required to follow the contract that he had negotiated with the district health authority and the hospital. I foresee consultants saying to general practitioners that if they wanted their patients treated in the local private hospital, it would be better to opt out and take out a contract with that hospital for the provision of services. I see nothing in the Bill to prevent them. Quite possibly the consultant who
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
does the operation in the private hospital has pressured the general practitioner to opt out and that practitioner may himself have a waiting list at the local general hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that this is impossible. If she does, will she point to whatever in the White Paper or the working documents or the legislation, shows that it is. For if it is true, it proves that the arrangement is not voluntary. It will in effect be the consultant who will determine what happens in the general practice in any area. The consultant can say, "I will do your operation, but not within the National Health Service in this hospital; if you want the work done you must become a budget holder who has a contract with a private hospital, because my district health authority hospital does not." If he has that measure of influence, it is the consultant who determines the nature of the care, the time that a patient spends on a waiting list and what happens within a particular budget-holding practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) asked an important question which will be mulled over by general practitioners. He is interested in the tax position of savings. I did not hear that question being answered, but I understand that it is being asked by a number of general practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the tax position when savings are made by those who have not opted out? I understand from one of the working documents that if practitioners make savings on the indicative drugs budget account they may retain 50 per cent. of those savings. I do not know what happens to those savings, or whether they are taxed, even when they are not allocated to the remuneration of those who work within the practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are the savings of budget holders who spend less than the FPCs' allocations. What happens to those savings? Even if they are not paid out in salaries, we may see here what has happened in America, where large amounts of money made by savings on Medicare physician payments through health maintenance organisations are spent on developing buildings in which physicians practise. It is possible that doctors will seek to develop the buildings in which they practise at a cost to patient care. They may say, "I need another three or four consulting rooms" and so a property consideration might enter calculations that historically were based only on medical considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position of property? The Minister, when pressed, said that general practitioners could not buy motor cars for their practices. That may be so, but they may be able to prove—I do not know to whom—that they need additional space even when an objective assessment cannot be made to substantiate that need. Perhaps they have sufficient local influence, or someone may not wish to upset their practice. Anyway the money, by that time, is already theirs. A capital allocation has been made, and so it will not be clawed back. If they decide to invest money, who is to stop them? If they are not stopped, what guarantee is there that what happens in America will not happen here? I have described before how over there people develop extensive practices based on far more buildings than they need. We could call that the British High street building society syndrome. We all know that if all those smart building society offices in British High streets disappeared tomorrow or moved away it would have a negligible effect on the amount of money raised by building societies. Those buildings represent an unnecessary front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
The savings may result from a reduction in the standard of care—a failure, for example to refer people to out-patients departments rather than prescribing drugs—or a cheaper form of treatment. I may be unnecessarily suspicious, but, having sat through the Committee last week and listened to the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) bashing away at me as usual for my attitude to consultants, I was surprised when I opened my 	<i>Sunday Times</i> last weekend. I have spent three years in the Public Accounts Committee questioning departmental officials on the subject and am fairly sure of my ground, so I should not have been surprised to see in the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> a whole middle-page spread identifying London consultants as doing exactly as I have said. Yet Conservative Members both here and in the Public Accounts Committee have repeatedly said that I was exaggerating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When framing legislation, we must set out to establish where there might be openings for abuse and make sure that the Bill closes those loopholes. The Government have not given assurances to those of us who have expressed reservations about what may happen under the NHS reforms proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall illustrate briefly why it could be difficult to rationalise GP practices so that they all appear to operate within a much narrower band of costs. We have heard how some GPs prescribe 25 times more drugs than others. That is an extreme example of the disparity within one element of practitioners' costs. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman who brought that fact to our attention did not mean to imply that many GPs consciously overprescribe as a matter of policy. Like me, he must understand that there can be great disparities between the general health of communities situated quite close together. It is well known that in the Cynon valley, for example, one area has a high incidence of bronchial problems—probably because there has been a large coking plant nearby for the past 50 years—whereas another part of the same valley has a much lower incidence of that illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To prove what I say, we have only to look at the latest available figures for general surgery waiting lists for hospitals in two parts of South Wales right next to each other. In 1988 in mid-Glamorgan there were 1,975 people on the non-urgent waiting list while in south Glamorgan the figures were almost exactly the same, but on the urgent waiting lists there were only 81 people in mid-Glamorgan but 328 in south Glamorgan. There were four times as many patients on the urgent case list in South Glamorgan as there were in mid-Glamorgan. That will generate different medication requirements, and doctors' house-calls will usually be more frequent to patients on the urgent list. Larger numbers of patients will visit surgeries and take up more of a doctor's time. How will such variables be taken into account when the fairness and efficiency of practitioners' budgets are assessed? Moreover, who will judge whether the assessments are accurate? Page 20 of the notes on clauses states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be no appeal arrangements in Wales because, in the absence of a regional tier, the Secretary of State for Wales will determine which practices should have budgets."</p></blockquote>
I do not have much confidence in that, not because I doubt that the Secretary of State will be anything other than fair, but because it calls for enormous subtlety in the way in which the requirements of individual practices are assessed. It asks too much of any Secretary of State to carry such a burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not usually respond to the Minister's reply to the debate, but on this occasion I feel that it is necessary to clear up several matters to which I hope that the Minister will in turn respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised by the Minister's reference to GP budgets as a charter for GPs. I had always understood that the thrust of the Government's changes was for a charter for patients. We have not been told that the power that will be granted to GPs will be passed on to patients. Patients will not have a voice in the way in which GPs run their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly any savings that a GP budget-holding practice can make can be used to improve its facilities, including equipment and buildings. However, will that money be regarded as income to the practice? If so, will it be subject to tax? It is important for GPs to know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the treatment that a GP considers necessary for a group of patients may take him over his practice's budget. Will the Minister explain whether the GP will have to commit himself to that cost by drawing on the practice's budget before the practice knows whether extra funds are to be allocated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the family practitioner committee, or other body, disallows the claim for extra funding, will the practice be penalised in the following year's budget allocation? If so, in some circumstances, cuts in the following year's budget would be inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doctors with budgets will be given choices that are not open to doctors outside the system. Will the Minister confirm that doctors with budgets who are subject to cost constraints will be able to send patients to the hospital of their choice, whether NHS or private, at the time of their choice, and that other GPs will be limited to services for which their local hospitals have contracts? If GPs with budgets will have much more choice, does not that confirm that there will be a two-tier system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that the GP-patient relationship will inevitably change as a result of the proposals? Will the GP not continually be looking at his budget, and at the cost of this or that treatment or the cost of this or that operation? The cost of health care will have to be balanced against the need for it. Trust between doctor and patient will be destroyed. The patient will not have confidence in the doctor to provide the necessary service because the doctor will continually have to consider whether it can be justified on cost grounds. The relationship between doctor and patient is under threat. Members of the Committee are not saying that—doctors and patients are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should listen to the voice of the patient. It is no good saying that patients have been misled for over 18 months. We should credit them and our constituents with greater intelligence. They see that the relationship is changing. Does not the Minister see that that is an inevitable consequence of the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in some difficulty, because so many of the details of the scheme are still unclear. We must continue to press the ministerial team for those details. This is one of our few opportunities to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a debate about cash limits this morning, and I am confused about what that debate meant. The Minister said that there will be no cash limits at the level of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
practice. That implies, however, that there will be a cash limit in a budget held by the RHA or some other authority from which practice budgets will be derived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my view that if the Minister's position is that there will be cash limits at regional level but not at GP level, she can vote for the amendment, which deals with cash limits at GP level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister would be extremely ill-advised not to vote for the amendment if that is what she means. If we have a number of building blocks to make a house and we are told that each building block is not cash limited but the house is, it is clear that at some point, the size of the house will restrict the building blocks. That is logical. If the Minister seriously wishes to assure us that the building blocks are not cash-limited, she has no alternative but to vote for the amendment. We are told that there will be exceptions and that a practice budget could in exceptional cases be surrendered halfway through the year. We are also told in the working paper
	<br><blockquote><p>"Practice Budgets for General Medical Practitioners"</p></blockquote>
that consideration will be given to putting a notional price tag on very expensive patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would enlighten us if the Minister told us how far defining and costing exceptions have advanced. Can she tell us what sort of cases will be regarded as exceptional to be provided for in practice budgets as requiring special financial allocations? For example, will patients who require expensive drug therapy, often available in hospitals but not in general practice, be regarded as exceptional cases? Retrovir is used in the treatment of AIDS, EPO—erythropoietin—for kidney patients and Eminase and its related drug therapies for heart and stroke patients, but all are very expensive drug treatments currently obtainable only in hospitals on a basis that is often cash limited. Are those the sort of exceptional cases that are to be individually provided for in practice budgets? If not, how are they to be provided for in those budgets? We need considerable enlightenment in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, practice budgets will not cover all hospital treatment. The working paper suggests that only certain elective surgery will be covered by them and indicates what will form such treatments, but how that will work on the ground is unclear. There is reference to discussions to define which surgical treatments will be contained in practice budgets and which will not. How far have those discussions progressed? Can the Minister tell us which elective surgery treatments will be covered in practice budgets and which will not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want an answer to a specific question about planned termination of pregnancy. It is clear that several elective gynaecological treatments are to be covered in practice budgets. That is an important issue that could affect many of the matters that the Minister will propose. Is planned termination of pregnancy to be covered in practice budgets or in hospitals? A good deal may hang on her answer with regard to the treatment of women. That is only an example of a more general problem of what is and what is not to be covered in the surgical treatments to be provided for in practice budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that practice budgets are to mirror the new weighted capitation system that is to be the basis of
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
allocations to regions and districts. Here, we are in danger of trespassing on territory covered by clause 18, so I merely observe that the smaller the unit to which one attempts to apply a weighted financial allocation system, the more unpredictable will be the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must clearly understand that the Government have worked-out a scheme for allocating money to practice budgets that will be sufficiently sensitive to the financial requirements. I hope that the Minister will refer us today to a practice budget formula that will neable us to understand how the allocation of money to practice budgets is to be made. If she cannot provide us with examples to show how those practice budgets will be worked out on the ground, she should withdraw clauses 13 and 14 and replace them in the Bill only when she can provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are expected to proceed on the basis of complex formulae, which at present are only a glint in the eye of the Secretary of State, wherever he may be, that is not good enough. The Minister must be able to assure us this afternoon that, somewhere, there is an example that all members of the Committee, the medical profession and interested members of the public can see that will exemplify a practice budget. One will do, but we need to be given an example to show how a practice budget could be worked out and how it would be weighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, we want to know how mentally ill people are to be costed and weighted in the system. Such people often make demands on time and treatment, but unpredictably and not regularly so. Incidents in the course of mental illness require considerable attention and expense at particular periods, but its overall development is not predictable. That is a specific example and we want the Minister to demonstrate that she has made provision for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that all members of the Committee will agree that my hon. Friend is making an excellent case. He mentioned people who are mentally ill. Does he agree that their problem is made more difficult, not only because of the revolving-door syndrome whereby patients leave one hospital, go into another and then re-enter the first, but by the Government's steadfast insistence that they will not introduce a system of assessment that would enable us to have a precise understanding of their problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. We regard the matter from the point of view of the patient and many of us will find ourselves included in practice budgets.

However, we may find that we are part of one, regardless of whether or not we like it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that the question asked by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) glaringly overlooked a fact tacitly acknowledged by the Secretary of State in other arenas on previous occasions? The matter received no response from the Minister this morning. One reason why there is movement by GPs towards the system is that this is the only part of the legislation which leaves them in control of the care of their patients and gets them away from the contractual relationships that are built into the earlier clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the point of view of both GPs and patients, we cannot discuss the legislation on the basis that we are launching a west end revue in which we may rely on the professionalism and esprit of those involved to ensure that everything will be all right on the night.

Our anxiety is understandable. We want to see the dramatis personae and have a rough idea of the plot before we buy the ticket. We are not able to do that, that is why we persist with our questions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a boring speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that. Hon. Members should have heard the hon. Gentleman speaking on the Companies Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are such episodes in all of our lives. We are an old duo. I leave the Committee to judge who is Robin and who is Batperson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that diagnostic investigations may be part of the practice budget system, but that is not made absolutely clear. Will the Minister say who is discussing the matter, who will decide and whether any conclusions have been reached? Will all or only some diagnostic investigations be part of the practice budget system? If only some—I hesitate to be so definite and concrete—perhaps the Minister will tell us which.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that on some basis, of costing either the attendance, the case or the practice—we are not told which: perhaps the Minister will enlighten us, although it is rather boring—the cost of further investigations at a hospital than those provided for in the doctor's initial reference will be borne by the hospital and not by the practice budget. In other words, there will be virement between one budget head held by the GP responsible to the RHA and another budget head held by the hospital, possibly under a contract, possibly on a self-governing basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure us that the fact that costs may be switched between one budget head and another will not act as a constraint on the nature, degree and quantity of diagnostic investigations? Budgets will restrain diagnostic investigations unless a provision is written into the system to ensure that they do not. We cannot be certain that the additional diagnostic procedures will be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the question of money. It is a sordid business, but if a budget system is to be introduced, it will
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
inevitably raise such questions. Working Paper 3 on practice budgets does not make it clear whether the cost of hospital treatments charged to the practice budget includes only the costs of the surgical procedures or whether it also includes the residence costs—in the Newspeak of the NHS, the hotel costs. Will the hotel costs be charged to the practice budget or only the cost of specific surgical procedures? That will make a considerable difference to the money side of the practice budget system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working Paper 3 refers to the accounting and accountability side of the practice budget system. We want to be sure that, through the accounting officer who will be the chief executive of the NHS management board, practice budgets and their costs are subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. We want the full armoury of parliamentary questioning and accountability brought to bear on the costs of the practice budget system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, GPs who hold practice budgets will have to account for how that money is used. Will a system of public accountability be established under which the form and the availability of the accounts are regulated? In the same way that we can scrutinise the accounts of companies, we want to scrutinise the accounts of practice budgets and be sure that an organisation exists which is capable of undertaking that duty on our behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working paper states that accident and emergency admissions will not be covered within the practice budgets. That will create the opportunity for doctors to refer people for accident and emergency treatment rather than their receiving a form of treatment, the costs of which are charged to the practice budget. We have been told that bodies will monitor GPs' referral patterns for normal treatment and their referral patterns for accident and emergency. Will the Minister explain how much is known about that so far?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a store of knowledge about larger GP practices which enables us to say, "Yes, we know their referral patterns for accident and emergency admissions and we know their referral patterns for normal treatment"? Which organisation is charged with the responsibility of updating that data base and monitoring the practice of referrals to ensure that there is no switching between accident and emergency and normal courses of hospital treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to my hon. Friend's remarks about certification and auditing.

There is a reference to powers being given to NAO inspectors to carry out value-for-money inquiries. However, I do not understand clearly the extent to which the role of the National Audit Office has been changed as a result of the introduction of the Audit Commission. Will my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, as I do not wish to delay the Minister's reply to the specific questions that she has been asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning the Minister seemed to suggest that we should have no fears about GP budgets, and that the anxieties we were expressing were invalid. In a superficial way she tried to wash over the questions we asked because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) said, "It will be all right on the night." The Government cannot have been listening to the GPs in Manchester. Right from the start they have expressed great anxieties about cash-limited budgets. A meeting of the Manchester local medical committee, attended by 185 GPs, unanimously passed a resolution rejecting GP budgets and saying that they believed they
	<br><blockquote><p>"will limit patient choice and damage the relationship between the doctor, the patient and the Hospital Services."</p></blockquote>
They based their anxieties about such damage on the way that cash-limited budgets work in other parts of the Health Service and in other aspects of Government policy. They had watched with horror how clinical nurse regrading was carried out in Manchester. It was clear that nurses were being regraded not on the worth of their jobs but so as to fit the cash-limited budget that the Secretary of State had imposed on the regrading exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State wrote to South Manchester health authority, which had expressed its worries about the lack of resources available in this financial year to meet the needs of patients. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Now I am told that the district health managers have estimated higher than expected expenditure arising from … clinical nurse regrading."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State was saying that the authority should have watched its budget, and fixed the nurse regrading within it. We had believed that the nurses would be getting a fair deal and that their grading would reflect the job they had to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of the worries that are facing GPs, worries about their freedom to prescribe treatment that they believe is in their patients' best interests rather than treatment that falls within a fixed sum of money. Similarly, they are worried because they have seen the way in which cash-limited budgets are working within the district health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been sent a series of letters by GPs in Manchester, illustrating the practices that they are having to adopt to try to fix the treatment to the budget. There was one farcical example when a local hospital wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Doctor,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As you may be aware the Health Authority has recently withdrawn our prescription pads in order to try and save money.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I should be grateful if you would therefore prescribe the following medication and you will be getting a more detailed letter from me in the near future."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
The hospital, which is cash-limited, is passing back to the GP the responsibility for prescribing drugs on its behalf, because it is not given pads to write prescriptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That arrangement dos not save the Health Service money. It simply transfers costs from the Health Service budget back to the GP budget. That is what worries doctors about GP budgets. They fear that when they are cash-limited, the same restrictions may be placed on them and that their prescription pads may be taken away from them at some point in the year when the financial crisis deepens, and that not only the hospital services—the in-patient and out-patient clinics at Withington hospital in this case—but also GP practices will not be able to prescribe the necessary treatment for their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
GPs have been most closely involved in the way in which their patients have tried to obtain money from the social fund, which is another example of a cash-limited budget. Many GPs have written letters to social fund officers in support of their patients' claims. Patients may have become ill as a result of living in poor housing conditions or in homeless family accommodation. The only way in which they can obtain decent housing is by being re-housed by the local authority. However, such people must obtain a loan or a grant from the social fund to buy essential furniture. Surely it would be in the interests of the Government to ensure that people obtained money from the social fund as it would take a strain off the need for health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because social fund budgets are cash limited, whether a person receives a grant or a loan depends on what time in the year he applies for it. People can be in poor circumstances at different times in a year and be denied grant on the sole grounds that there is not enough money in the budget to meet the needs that may arise later in the year. GPs are worried that the same will happen in respect of their budgets. Will GPs' budgets be monitored in the same way as social fund budgets are monitored? If the Minister says that the provision is a charter for GPs' budgets, we could claim that the social fund is a charter for Department of Social Security officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the two years that the social fund has been in being, the Government have changed the rules governing how money can be obtained from it. They did so to ensure that the cash-limited budget was not breached and that different categories of people were treated differently by the fund because it did not contain enough money to meet all the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the budgets of GPs be monitored month by month to ensure that the fixed amount given to the GP practice is phased throughout the year? Will GPs, after three or six months, be told that they are overspending their allocations not becuase of special circumstances, but because of their regular monthly expenditures? If the GP practice, like the social fund, is clearly overspending its month-by-month allocation, will GPs be reined in and told not to spend any more?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is happening in the hospital service. I have received a further letter which refers to the waiting list for hip replacement operations at Withington hospital. Doctors are waiting to perform those operations, and enough theatre space is available for them to do so. However, people are being asked to wait for such treatment until the new financial year because there is no money. Let us consider the GP who, in considering the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
best deal for his patients, buys in his allocation for hip replacement operations, for example. When that allocation has been used up in the first three or six months of the year, will it be regarded as an exceptional circumstance as the GP had not anticipated the extra demand for such operations? Will the GP be able to buy in later in the year to meet the needs of his patients?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the budget work in practice? Instead of giving the performance she gave this morning, when she was clearly all at sea on how the budgets will operate, will the Minister assure us that they will not operate as social fund budgets and that GPs will be free to prescribe based on need throughout the year? Will she clarify that that extra prescribing, if required, will not impinge on the following year's budget? If her answers are positive she is clearly able to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) was a little harsh on the Minister about her contribution this morning. If hon Members had listened to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), they would have realised exactly what has happened. He was right: it is the scenario of an Ingmar Bergman film. The explanation is quite clear; the Minister's script was written in Swedish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No clear definition of what general practitioners should expect as fund holders was contained in the Minister's speech. I do not like to indulge in personal attacks on other hon. Members, especially on the Minister. As I have said before, the Minister and I go back a long way—we canvassed the streets of Farnham and Godalming, not for the same party but at about the same time. I fear that she has spent too much time visiting the food counters of Marks and Spencer. The result is her extraordinary explanation this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not intervene to support my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) when he persisted in saying that questions put to the Minister about that important matter had not been answered. Had we been able to put those questions to the Minister, many of this afternoon's speeches would have been unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent Saturday afternoon visiting a general practitioner in my constituency. Dr. Stuart Fraser, who practises at 151 Scraptoff Lane, is my mother's local general practitioner. He met my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) when she made her whistle-stop tour of Leicester a couple of months ago. Dr. Fraser showed me round his surgery, which was not operational then, explaining with great pride the enormous amount of work, effort and dedication that he and his partners had put into the practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practice began in Leicester in 1876. Through a series of mergers and marriages, Dr. Fraser had succeeded to the senior partnership. As secretary of the local branch of the British Medical Association in Leicestershire, it was part of his task to seek the views of the more than 450 general practitioners of that area about the Government's proposals. If the Minister spent more time talking to general practitioners in Farnham, and less time visiting Marks and Spencer in Guildford, she would discover that the vast majority of general practitioners do not share her optimism about how fund-holding practices will operate. We should respect them as professional people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will realise that only volunteers will operate such budgets.
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
The views of those volunteers must also be taken into consideration. No one has been twisting arms; no one has made them do it. Yet practices in my constituency have already expressed interest in moving down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone taking part in the scheme will know that there is a hidden agenda. Those who do not volunteer will be treated differently. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the scenario of the Education Reform Act 1988, and how those who have opted out are treated differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Fraser, the other members of his practice and the other general practitioners in Leicestershire fear that the fund-holding scheme will severely damage the present relationship with patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Withington is right to draw parallels with the social fund. One of the issues raised by Dr. Fraser was the prospect of violence in his waiting room—violence against him and other members of the practice. When patients ask for a particular sort of treatment, the commercial judgment that has to be made will result in scenes of unpleasantness or even violence. The same scenario is enacted in respect of the social fund. Those in the Department of Social Security who work in the front line in the inquiry office have to make similar decisions. They tell of the anger, resentment and frustration of those who seek to claim on the social fund but are unable to do so because of the cash limits placed on that fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same scenario will develop with general practitioners as fund holders. Dr. Fraser spoke of the length of time and the effort that he will have to expend in negotiating with regional health authorities and with general management about the level of the budget. Will the Minister confirm that we are talking not about money to be transferred to general practitioners, but about an account to be kept by general managers and regional health authorities? That account will be debited each time the services are used. Dr. Fraser fears that his time is to be spent in fruitless negotiations with those in charge of budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was pressed for an answer by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington about the problems that would arise when a general practitioner had spent more than his budget. The issue of doctor capping was raised. We did not hear the Minister's response. Will the regulations provide sanctions about how doctors spend their allocations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at page 20 of the special notes for guidance. Although it is clear that regulations will be enacted, we cannot be sure when they will be available. We hope that the Committee will be able to scrutinise them. No indication is given of what sanctions will be used. Dr. Fraser's fear is that if his practice is near the end of its budget there will be greater pressure and commercial decisions will have to take precedence over health care provision. Dr. Fraser would like to provide the kind of service that has been provided by members of his family and of his practice for more than half a century and a half. He feels that it is not possible to provide that excellence under the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several questions have been put to the Minister. I realise that it is difficult for her to answer them all. But it is necessary to have the answers so that those who administer the scheme know exactly where they stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour, once again, to respond to the points that were raised, having already responded earlier. I hope that my hon. Friends will bear with me if I repeat some of my comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those who ask for a practice fund will be volunteers. There will be no pressed men. Practices will decide whether the opportunity of having a fund will enable them better to serve their patients. It is clear from the number who responded to the programme that was launched by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State before Christmas that many GPs feel that it will enable them to develop more flexible services, the better to meet their patients' needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) suggested that he was perhaps unnecessarily suspicious, and I agree. If he and other hon. Members read the programme "Funding General Practice" that was launched by the Secretary of State, they will find that it contains very much more detail than did the original working paper. The original working paper suggested that 5 per cent. could be advanced to a practice budget one year and reclaimed the following year, and we have decided to review that suggestion. As I said this morning, if a practice fund is short of resources or has unexpected demands on its budget, it can go to the FHSA or the RHA and ask for its budget to be reviewed in that year. Year on year, of course, it is a subject for discussion, and if the practice is not happy, it is free to leave the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consideration will be given to patients with chronic complaints, and the DHA will bear the cost of hospital treatment, if it is more than £5,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about £5,000 if it was a hospital cost. What if it is a drug cost? I am told that the annual cost of drugs for a transplant is likely to be in excess of £5,000 per patient. How will that cost affect the practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already made it clear that the cost of the drugs will be reflected in the indicative budget, which is the subject of clause 31.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) spoke about VAT and tax. No VAT will be charged on GP practice funds, nor will they have to charge it. Similarly, tax on savings made by a practice will not be regarded as taxable income. The proceeds from those savings are to be used for patient care, not for the personal remuneration of any who are working in the practice. One issue is outstanding—one to which the hon. Member for Workington, characteristically, was about to address himself this morning: when resources have been ploughed into the premises for patients' benefit, a liability for capital gains tax may arise when the premises are to be sold. We are seeking guidance from the Inland Revenue on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principles are clear and unequivocal. The savings are to be used for patient services rather than for the remuneration and benefit of those in the practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Government are seeking clarification from the Inland Revenue, and I presume that the Revenue will confirm that there is a liability. But I was talking about the capital gain itself. I am trying to relate the savings to the increase that will accrue in the value of buildings that have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
extended using savings that may have been gleaned by reducing health care in the practice. I wanted to know whether that could happen and, if it could, what the tax position would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we have resolved the matter satisfactorily, we shall give clear guidance on it. But I emphasise again that the savings are to be used for patient care, not for personal remuneration. Indeed, the accounts will be audited and there will be a monthly report on the activities of fund holders. All possible safeguards will be in force to ensure that the resources are used for the purposes for which they are intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the potential danger of abuses in spending practice funds. That is why, as I hope the hon. Member for Workington appreciates, clause 14(6) and (7) allow any sums illegitimately spent—on cars or foreign holidays, for example—to be recovered from general practitioners rather than from the practice fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) asked about appeals against decisions on practice budgets. Appeals made on the establishment of practice budgets must be on whether they should be authorised at all. The precise level of any budget is a matter for discussion between the individual practice and the health authority, or the Secretary of State in the case of Wales. Practices are always free to walk away from the proposed budget if they choose. Many general practitioners believe that budgets will offer them a chance to provide a better service to their patients. I have made it clear repeatedly that there is no question of patients being refused the treatment that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) asked about the benefits for patients. Patients will be better able to benefit from a more flexible and appropriate service from their general practitioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I answered that question at length this morning. At present, a general practitioner has little incentive to develop services on his own premises. There are many good reasons why a patient would benefit from having diagnostic tests and minor surgical treatment at the general practitioner's surgery, but, at present, if the patient is referred on to a hospital for any of those treatments, the financial burden is borne by the district. The general practitioner therefore has less to do and the patients' needs are probably not so well met as they would be in that less stressful situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many patients would rather have their treatment at the general practitioner's surgery because it is more convenient and less frightening. The mechanism of establishing a budget will create a virtuous circle rather than a vicious circle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be aware that many practices now provide those services. She will be aware also that the first point of contact for any patient is the general practitioner and that, as in the practice in my locality where there are six doctors served, GPs are busy from morning until night and overnight. From where is flexibility to come?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key point is that general practitioners who see no advantage in joining a practice fund have no need to do so. If they believe that they have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
all the facilities, influence and leverage over the health authorities that they could wish for, they will not come forward. Those who are coming forward wish to have more control over their practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The idea appeals to them of being able to invest their savings in the purchase of further equipment for their surgeries, in improving their premises,, perhaps in promoting a health education campaign and in many other ways which they feel will afford better help for the patients who they serve. I reject the suggestion that other GPs are having their options constrained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, under the system of contracts, DHAs will have to make great efforts to talk with GPs about their choices in referrals to hospitals in which they have confidence. They will have to keep contingency funds to cover referrals to hospitals other than those to which they traditionally send patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) talked about overspending. The key point is that a practice will need to keep in close touch with the FPSA and the RHA to make it clear, monthly and annually, that it is being conducted in an appropriate manner. There will be times when underspending is as much a source of concern as overspending. When a practice would like its fund to be reconsidered for special circumstances in the middle of the year, that option, as I have made plain time and again, will be open to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister make it clear what sanctions are available when doctors overspend or underspend their budget? If they do not spend up to the level of the budgets that they were originally given, there will be pressure to get them to agree that they may not be prescribing relevant treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of fund-holding practices, the Minister raised the issue of doctors who performed minor operations in their surgeries, or did I get it completely wrong? The removal of moles, for example, involves minor forms of surgery. I am confused because the hon. Lady raised the matter in the context of fund-holding budgets. If she meant to do so, how are those operations to be costed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about practices which overspend. Such practices will be subject to examination by the FHSA and the RHA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the sanction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sanction is that if they continue to overspend, the practice fund facility will be withdrawn. It will be continued only if the FHSA and the RHA are satisfied that the practices are discharging their responsibilities, properly and effectively, to provide a high standard of care. When we come to the specific nature of diagnostic treatment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about underspenders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Similary, in regard to underspenders, the FHSA and the RHA need to be satisfied that a high standard of care is being provided. Practice funds will be subject to continuing discussion and consultation between the health authorities and the GP practices. That will happen when establishing the size of the budgets, and also subsequently. Should the FHSA lose confidence that a proper standard of care was being provided, the sanction would be to withdraw the practice budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister a simple question. If a practice underspends by £50,000 in one year, where does that remaining money go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is clear that the practice budget has saved the money by the efficient and effective care of patients, GPs can use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it abundantly clear to the hon. Gentleman that GPs can use the money to improve care, to buy further medical equipment, to improve their premises, to set up a health education campaign and so on. It would be a different matter if the practice had underspent and there was anxiety about the quality of care it provided—anxiety which the family health services authority would want to investigate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked about the precise nature of diagnostic tests. I urge him to look at the programme, which outlines in great detail the tests and treatments that will be subject to the practice fund. He referred specifically to the termination of pregnancy. That will be excluded from the treatment and diagnoses that will be subject to the practice fund, as will be all maternity services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the formulae for setting the practice funds, I hope that hon. Members will consult the programme, which clarifies how the budget will be constructed. I referred this morning to the continuing discussions that will take place between those wishing to set up a practice fund and the FHSA and the RHA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central that the accounting officer, Duncan Nichol, the NHS chief executive, will be accountable to the Public Accounts Committee. The accounts of practice budgets will be audited by the Audit Commission as part of its audit of FHSA accounts. Amendments to achieve that have been tabled today. I can also assure the hon. Gentleman that the National Audit Office will retain its access to all relevant accounts and information, in its role as statutory auditor of the Government. Its responsibility to conduct value-for-money studies in the NHS will remain unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Budgets will be carefully monitored by the family health services authority. They will be checked regularly to see whether there is underspending or overspending. The proposals offer general practitioners an opportunity to develop a standard and quality of service for their patients. They are a vote of confidence in general practitioners. No patient will be refused the treatment that he or she needs. I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to return to the matter, but I do not understand why I should have to let go of the questions that I asked. There is an army of civil servants in the Room who could reply to my questions. What will happen to the group of free prescription holders? Perhaps the fact that I am one of them is immaterial. Will the total prescription cost for those people who are exempt from prescription costs be paid by the fund-holding budget? If so, what mechanism will be established to compensate the budget holder?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked several questions, but my second major question was whether a consultant could influence a general practitioner to opt out or be a budget holder by telling him that if he wanted the consultant's services the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
doctor would have to become a budget holder and develop a contract with a local private hospital. That was a simple question. If it is not possible, the Minister could say "It is not possible and it will not happen". I would be satisfied with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other unanswered question was my suggestion that a general practitioner may be inclined to drug-treat patients who should be referred to a consultant. If that will not happen, the Minister should tell the Committee. Constituents will believe that their doctors might no longer send them to consultants because it would be cheaper to treat them with drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are simple questions. The Minister has not answered them. He should reply, especially to the question on prescriptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her response, the Minister raised an important point about the performance of minor surgery at a general practitioner's surgery. I mentioned the example of the removal of moles from a person's skin. Did the Minister mean to raise that question in the context of fund-holding practices? If so, how will those operations be costed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to respond again after this intervention. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) talked about free prescriptions. That is neither here nor there for the GP budget fund. We have a system of free prescriptions; 70 per cent, are free. Of course, the prescription costs money; the GP budget-holder will be charged in exactly the same way as for all other drugs. But we have made clear time and again that, when setting the budget, the number of patients with chronic disorders or patients who are likely to need costly prescriptions will be given consideration, as will those who have hospital treatment costing more than £5,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington then spoke of the relationship of general practitioners with the private sector. If it was thought that the general practitioners in the practice fund were behaving improperly, or coming under undue influence, it would most certainly be of concern to the family health service authority or the regional health authority. But if a doctor could use his practice fund to good effect for his patients in the private sector, there would be no objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman described himself as being unnecessarily suspicious. He talked about the fear that general practitioners would use drugs rather than refer their patients to hospitals. The purpose is to allow general practitioners to exercise their judgment. But, as in any other area of their activities, questions about the quality of their service should be taken up with the services committee and other forums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Minor surgery comes under the GP contract. We have made it clear that it is possible for any general practitioner—in or outside a fund holding—to undertake minor treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fund holder may choose to move into more diagnostic work after having invested in the necessary equipment. The key issue is a higher standard of patient care. It is the patients who will have the power under our regime. It is the patients who will more easily be able to choose the general practitioner. Our proposals are intended to raise the standard of patient care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not responded satisfactorily to a range of questions. I sense two feelings among Opposition Members. First is a sense of frustration that important questions are not being answered—questions raised by us and by outside organisations. Secondly, there is a feeling that however many times we put the questions, we will not get a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not given the Committee one reason why the Committee should not vote for the amendment. Nor have Opposition Members been given any reason not to press the amendment to a Division. The Minister has not given her Back Benchers one reason why they should not vote for the amendment. Indeed, the Minister has not specified one reason why she herself cannot vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. Members to compare the amendment with what the Minister said. The Minister said that no fund-holding practice will be cash-limited. She also said that no fund-holding practice will have to limit the services purchased by the practice because of lack of funds. Why cannot the Minister vote for the amendment? If the Minister said that the amendment had a technical deficiency, we might accept that and come back on Report with another version. But the Minister has given no reason why the amendment cannot be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is a lawyer. What would happen in a court of law? Let us imagine an action between an opted-out practice and a newly-formed family practitioner committee. Would it be in order for the lawyer representing the practice to cite the proceedings of the Committee in a court of law, quoting directly what my hon. Friend said in interpreting the Minister's remarks, and the Minister's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a rule of interpretation that courts can only consider an Act. The Minister's assurances do not mean anything. We will not accept her assurances if she will not accept our amendment. There is no reason why our amendment should not be accepted. The Minister's bland assurances will not satisfy GPs, they will not satisfy patients and they do not satisfy us. We are concerned about how the Bill comes out of Committee. It is clear that the alloted sum for GPs will be cash limited. The losers will be those whose need is greatest. That is why we press our unobjectionable amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. This is not a spurious point of order; it is about the distinction between a debate on the Floor of the House and a debate in Committee. When a Division is called in the Chamber everyone comes out of the woodwork from all over Westminster to vote. At the end of the debate the Lobbies are swelled with many who did not hear the arguments. That is not what happens in Committee. The resolution that is passed on the Floor of the House is that the Bill should be considered in Committee, and it is assumed that those who serve on the Committee will attend its debates. The public who read Hansard should know that throughout our debate, when the matters that have been put to the vote were being considered, the Secretary of State was absent. Only minutes before the Division did he walk in to cast his vote. In my view—[HON. MEMBERS: "Where is the hon. Member for Peckham?"] Hon. Members will recall that my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) was here for the debate. The Secretary of State had not properly considered the amendment when he issued his instructions to the Whip to make sure that Conservative Members voted against an amendment that is consonant with the Government's policy as it has been interpreted to the Committee today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no danger of our spending so long over the two amendments in my name as we have over the previous two amendments, which we started to debate at half-past 10 this morning. I shall not detain the Committee long. Both amendments are related to our earlier discussions and I shall explain briefly their salient points. We have already discussed at length the inevitable impact of the new regime on the relationships between individual patients and their general practitioners if the Government's proposals are enacted as they stand. Nothing in the Secretary of State's "wing and a prayer" attitude has convinced me that that relationship will not be significantly altered, if not in some cases poisoned, as a result of those measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of the words with which the Minister for Health ended one of her earlier speeches. She described the clause as a vote of confidence in general practice. It must be a rare example of the Government giving such a ringing vote of confidence—clearly they have fond no echo of a vote of confidence in return from the general practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said on the Floor of the House during a recent debate on another health matter that the present Secretary of State was appointed as the great communicator. If that is the case, his tenure so far casts him as one of the most misunderstood men in post-war British politics. That "vote of confidence" has not had the support of general practitioners—anything but—and, I suggest, patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 509 would provide the more clearly identified, solidly based charter of patients' rights which is sorely needed because of the present confusion. Health
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
Ministers have failed to give specific examples of how the changes will flesh out guarantees about the standard and nature of care that must be maintained in the new set-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations that amendment No. 509 would require to provide for minimum standards could touch on matters that might more properly lie within the realm of the GPs contract—itself a far from happy concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guarantees of this type are important in the light of the experience of the United States. There is the infamous story of the Health Maintenance Organisation—a model for budget holding—which was placed on the second floor of a building without lifts so the disabled were discouraged from draining its resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now seem to be adopting that nearest equivalent developed system as a model for ourselves, and the statement of intent must make it clear that the prime duty of the budget holder is to the patient. The Minister tells us that is how it will work out, so why can it not be written into the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contract encourages GPs to take on more patients, but one of the inevitable outcomes will be that the doctor has less time to spend with them. That consequence, in combination with the natural desire of budget holders to have "cheaper" patients, has led to worries among elderly and other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 509 were written into the legislation and were then built upon by those who administer the system, it could amount to a statement of intent and would go some way towards a patients' charter. It would reassure the patients, and give their advocates the clout to ensure that the elderly and the homeless are not turned away as a result of the changes. It would also give doctors greater bargaining power to pursue increased budgets, if they could point to a statutory requirement to provide certain standards of care that would be unattainable under their existing budgets. It would improve their negotiating position, and that, too, would be in the interests of patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appears to attach herself to the so-called criterion of patient care, so I hope that the amendment commends itself to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 511 would require an annual public meeting and report
	<br><blockquote><p>"to explain the operation of the fund holding practice over the year."</p></blockquote>
It is clear from the working papers and the legislation that the doctors will have to do a considerable amount of administration; funds will be earmarked to deal with it, both in the set-up period and thereafter. That being so, and as reports will be going to FPCs setting out referrals, drug costs and so on, it would surely not be too arduous a task for the practice to collate the essentials of the information annually and to make it available to patients. If the purpose of the Bill is to increase the responsiveness and accountability of doctors to their patients, such a move must be in the right direction.

Preventive medicine and preventive health strategies carry the important prior requirement of greater medical awareness on the part of the patient. The argument advanced by Ministers about school boards is that that system will increase the sense of civic involvement, public commitment and accountability of professionals to
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
members of the public. If that argument holds tight for school boards, why should it not do so for the active citizenry whom the Government claim they are trying to encourage in this instance? They would be patients who, quite rightly, would take a greater interest in the range of facilities being offered by practices, the hours they kept and how they compared, in a competitive sense, with others in neighbouring areas or other parts of the same communities. I wait to hear whether amendment No. 507 commends itself to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is that the clause will pollute the relationship between patients and doctors. As long as it remains unamended, the legislation can have no other effect. The two probing amendments would at least give us a sense that we were moving towards a healthier basis for a proper relationship between doctors and patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am delighted to be able to intervene in this discussion. I had the misfortune to miss a large part of the four-and-a-half hour debate on the previous group of amendments, which turned on what seemed to me to be a remarkably narrow point. I shall have to read the Official Report to understand the intricacies of an argument which took so long before a conclusion was reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to answer the questions asked by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) about the impact on the patient services of GPs that might result from the changes that we propose. In previous debates on the contract, the hon. Gentleman has attacked the Government's proposals. What he says is usually based on a total misunderstanding of them and the arguments that he uses are frequently highly inconsistent. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is not beyond redemption, so I shall make yet another attempt to persuade him by referring to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to be concerned, as we all are, about the standards of service which patients get from their GPs and the degree to which they account to patients for those services. For that reason, several safeguards are built into the Government's proposals which affect all GPs, so I do not concede that the amendments are needed for fund-holding GPs in particular. Standards of service are already covered in the terms of services of all GPs—and so they should. Therefore, there is no need for fresh regulations which lay them down for that group of GPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new contract that we recently introduced will mean that all GPs will be required to produce annual reports on the activities of their practices. Those reports will include information about the number of referrals to hospitals, the number and the duties of practice staff and changes to the practice premises, for example. Every feature of the contract that we have introduced for all GPs is concerned with standards of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the new contract will be performance related, why there will be specific payments for such services as child surveillance and minor surgery, and why we have put in performance targets and so on. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said in reply to the previous debate, the contract will apply to all GPs in the relevant parts of their practices. It is part of a sustained effort better to reward those who provide the best services to make them more responsive to their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye has reminded me that, with total inconsistency, he voted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
against the contract that contained the standards of service and required all GPs to produce annual reports by using, yet again—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye continues to advance the ridiculous argument that he is against the contract because it means that all GPs will have more patients. That ingenious argument was put together by the General Medical Services Committee but it does not stand up to mathematical examination or any other commonsense approach. The amendments incorporate minor features of the general contract for all GPs. At least one was opposed by the GMSC, with which the hon. Gentleman is so impressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement for an annual report was something at which the representatives demurred in the new contract. They said that it would mean form filling and impose burdens upon them. Despite the hon. Gentleman's vote, we stuck to our guns and there will be an annual report. It is a bit rich for him to table an amendment which provides that some GPs would have to produce one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Secretary of State for Health behaves less like a Cabinet Minister and more like the Queen's counsel that he is behind his avuncular exterior.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was highly selective. In the debate in the Chamber on the GPs' contract, I specifically welcomed the items in the amendments. My basis for opposing the GPs contract was the attitude of the Secretary of State and the fact that he was ramming the measure through in the teeth of opposition. I said that there was much in the proposal that we welcomed, specifically those items that he has just mentioned. We are not in the pockets of the GMSC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If accountability is central to the Minister's argument, what is wrong with writing into legislation provisions that will increase professional accountability to the patient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall build on that part of the hon. Gentleman's intervention in which he claimed that he agreed all along with certain aspects of the contract, including minimum standards of service and annual reports. As far as the law is concerned, they are enforceable through the contract. They already exist, therefore an amendment for a particular group of GPs is not required. There is no point in restating what is already imposed upon all GPs. Although I resist the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of introducing a legal obligation, I do not reject all his ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 511 is the more significant proposal because minimum standards of service must be guaranteed anyway. There is nothing wrong with a practice deciding to hold a public meeting for patients, discussing what it is doing and explaining its policy. I would actively encourage anyone who suggested such an idea. The kind of people who go in for practice budget holding would be attracted by it. However, I resist the idea that because a particular group of GPs decides to exercise control over the funds they should be placed under a prescriptive legal obligation. Openness and discussion with the patients will help to attract them to a practice and make fund-holding practices successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a continual suspicion behind the amendments that those GPs who decide to have their own funds and to exercise more control over resources will want to skimp and to reduce standards. If hon. Members met those GPs who were interested they would know that it was not only
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
ridiculous but an insult to make such a suggestion. The comparison with the United States is false. Nothing in the Bill remotely resembles the American health maintenance organisations or anything of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said that GPs have rejected the proposal. He means that the GMSC has rejected it. Many GPs with lists of the relevant size to be eligible for practice budgets will welcome the idea. Those who come forward are go-ahead, keen GPs who see a great future for general practice and want to take advantage of these opportunities to influence the way in which resources are used locally. It is absurd to suggest that they have sinister motives and that their aim is to skimp at patients' expense to further their own pecuniary interests—something that we intend to rule out, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears that have motivated the amendment are false, and both proposals are unnecessary. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that this short exchange has given the Secretary of State an opportunity to put something on the record. Opposition Members have the impression that he is a cross between Howard Hughes and the Great Gatsby, who were famous for throwing big parties, inviting lots of people, and then not showing up. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman is here, he may get a chance to take part in another Division, but yet again, he has failed to salvage my sceptical soul.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard much of the debate on the amendment, but what I have heard is probably more than the right hon. and learned Gentleman has heard of our debates in total. I intervene because the Secretary of State is here, and I want to remind him of something. I want to take his mind back nearly nine years, and I do so because people outside are trying to assess the credibility of his statements. What I am about to say is relevant to this amendment, Dame Janet, because we are talking about whether ministerial undertakings on Opposition amendments are valid and should be given credibility by those outside who read our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will remember an amendment on trial areas that was moved in our deliberations on the Transport Bill, as it then was, in 1981. On that occasion he rose to give my constituents assurances about the future of public transport in their area. The words that he used are ingrained on my memory, and I quote them regularly at public meetings, even today. Indeed, I often send out a copy of the speech that he made—at the time, he was a junior Minister at the Department of Transport—on the subject of bus deregulation, together with a copy of my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The hon. Gentleman is now referring to a speech that was made in 1981. May I point out that bus deregulation did not come under the Transport Act 1981, but under the Transport Act 1985? It is clear that the hon. Gentleman is basing his argument on the wrong premise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) consults his right hon. and learned Friend, I think that he will find that what I say is correct. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that 'before any of my old buck—that is, I am sure, a term that he uses regularly—got into my local newspaper, he should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
set out the facts. Then, on the basis of what the Bill said, he gave an undertaking to my constituents that nothing would happen in the way that I had suggested. I have to tell him that within the subsequent three years, his words proved empty and a number of services in Cumbria were lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that because when people assess the validity of undertakings given to the Committee by the Secretary of State, they should view them in the light of the reply that he gave me on that occasion. I did not believe him then. He tried to assure my constituents, and his comments were widely covered in the local press, but his assurances turned out to be empty. I say now to the Secretary of State: in replying to this debate—and, indeed, repeatedly to a number of amendments during our proceedings—he has given assurances that will turn out to be empty and invalid. Time will unfortunately prove me correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all members of the Committee will be grateful if the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) and I keep the re-living of our youth to the minimum amount of time. I well remember our exchanges on the Transport Bill, but the hon. Gentleman should make sure that his recollection is correct. We were talking about the deregulation of coach and tour operations, and he was one of its most passionate opponents. He said that it would ruin public transport as we knew it. He defended a system whereby if a coach operator wished to run a weekend excursion to Blackpool, he could do so only if he obtained the permission of all his opponents and demonstrated the need for it. Moreover, it was not possible to run coaches on motorways or in rural areas without the permission of a traffic commissioner. The hon. Gentleman raised fears and claimed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
