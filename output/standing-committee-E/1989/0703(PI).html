	<p>(Except clauses 3, 9,10 to 20, 23,25 and 68)</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Before we begin, let me make three brief announcements. First, the selection list anticipates the Committee approving the motion that the Minister will move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the starred amendments have been selected to help hon. Members because of the short notice that was given of some new clauses. Therefore, it seemed unfair not to select starred amendments in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it would be for the Committee's convenience to know of my intentions for adjourning. A division in the House is expected at 7 o'clock. I propose that the Committee should adjourn at 7 o'clock for a quarter of an hour and return until 8.15 pm, when we shall adjourn for two hours, which would take us past the Division at 10 o'clock. I hope that that announcement is academic, but at least hon. Members now know what I have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Questioned proposed.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the order in which the remaining proceedings on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be new Clause 12, new Clause 22, new Clause 26, new Clause 27, new Clause 49, new Clause 51, new Clause 56, new Clause 57, remaining new Clauses (except new Clauses 67 to 72), new Clauses 67 to 72, remaining new Schedules, Schedule 16.—[Mr. Lilley.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit difficult to keep up with the Government's intentions on the order of business. I was unable to clarify matters last night because the Government moved the closure as I was about to speak. It would be helpful to know why the Government tabled this motion which puts Government new clauses 67 to 72 at the end of today's consideration. Moreover, why were those new clauses tabled, removed and then retabled late on Friday in a very slightly modified version? They have to be combed very carefully to discover the modifications. It would help the Committee if the Government would explain precisely what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I apologise for the fact that the original Ways and Means resolution was removed and new clauses were delayed. The reason was simply that the original timing of the Ways and Means resolution fell foul of a perfectly legitimate Opposition filibuster attempt to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>
prolong the debate on other matters. It was thought that the House would not welcome debating the Ways and Means resolution in the early hours of the morning, so it was decided to debate it last night instead. When we realised that that opportunity existed, we tried to contact the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who had tabled amendments, so that they could revive those amendments. We wanted also to notify them of the small changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for withdrawing the resolution was in no way malign, nor was it an attempt to confuse the Committee. We proposed that the Government new clauses should be taken at the end of the day. Although it is traditional to take Government new clauses on the first day of consideration of new clauses, having missed that opportunity, we felt that it was wrong to pre-empt the prime time available to the Opposition at the beginning of today's sitting. We therefore decided to opt for the end of today's sitting. We believe that that is sensible and co-operative. There is no ruse behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government have deprived the Opposition of one opportunity to continue a filibuster in order to create an opportunity for them to carry out another? Although that is kind to the Opposition, will my hon. Friend in future give more consideration to his hon. Friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall take that as a plea for future filibusters to run in series rather than in instalments. However, I am not in charge of filibusters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am concerned with such matters, and I hope that we do not have a filibuster now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not believe in the conspiracy theory, but I suspect that the Government have been in chaos over the arrangements. In so far as retabling the clauses has enabled us to consider these matters first in Committees rather than on Report, I am glad that the Government have taken this action with the Committee's agenda. The new clauses introduce a new and major tax. It would have been wrong to deal with them initially on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. Just before we rose on Thursday, I moved new clause 4 at some speed. Some alterations will be made to the record. I have agreed them with Hansard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure that the hon. Gentleman now has his comments correctly on the record. Hansard does an incredibly difficult job, incredibly well. Occasionally, mistakes are made, but I am sure that they will be corrected before the next edition of this much-awaited journal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>the Income Tax Acts shall have effect as if the undertaking by that person of that engagement constituted the carrying on of a profession within Case II of Schedule D; and accordingly Schedule E shall not apply to the emoluments from the engagement."</p>
	<p>(2) This section applies for the year 1990-1991 and subsequent years of assessment.'.—	<i>[Mr. Tim Smith.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the first time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>'(1) The following section shall be inserted after section 198 of the Taxes Act 1988.</p>
	<p>	<i>"198A Entertainers and journalists</i></p>
	<p>(i) Where an individual is assessable to income tax under Schedule E In respect of the emoluments from a relevant employment, section 198(1) above shall have effect in relation to that employment as if it read "If the holder of an office or employment incurs and defrays out of the -emoluments of that office or employment the expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of that office or employment, or otherwise to expend money wholly and exclusively in the performance of those duties, there may be deducted from the emoluments to be assessed the expenses to incurred and defrayed.</p>
	<p>(ii) Where an individual is assessable to income tax under Schedule E in respect of the emoluments from a relevant employment, The Board of Inland Revenue shall, on his request, issue to his employer in relation to that Employment such a notice of coding as does not require the employer to deduct tax from the emoluments paid to that individual.</p>
	<p>(iii) A relevant employment for the purpose of subsections (i) and (ii) above is any employment wholly or mainly as an actor, singer, musician, dancer, entertainer or journalist other than an employment which is likely both to have a duration of over one year and the emoluments from which are likely to form the preponderant part of the individuals' income assessable under Schedule E for any year of assessment."</p>
	<p>(2) this section shall have effect for the year 1990-91 and subsequent years of assessment.'.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:When the Inland Revenue published its departmental statement for 1990–91,1 noticed that one of its aims in administering the tax system was that people should be treated equally under the law. As a result of some recent administrative changes made by Inland Revenue, some classes of taxpayers—entertainers and actors—are not treated equally under the law. This problem has a long history. I do not wish to bore the Committee with that history, nor do I wish to take up much time in saying that actors and the theatre are good things. Were I not a Member of Parliament, however, I would spend much more of my time going to the theatre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was a Member of Parliament, I used to attend virtually every play performed at the Littleton and Olivier theatres and many plays performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Barbican. It is regrettable that I am no longer in a position to keep my threatre attendance up. I am only a layman, but I am a keen theatre goer. I strongly support British theatre, which is the best in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much debate about whether individual taxpayers are employed or self-employed. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>488</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this we may take new clause 22-	<i>Entertainers and journalists</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Definitions of each group are deliberately widely drawn. Much descretion is left to the Inland Revenue in making the initial determination. However, the final determination is up to the courts. Two court cases are especially relevant. My hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Arnold) referred to both when he raised the issue of the taxation of actors in an Adjournment debate on 27 February. Many of the important arguments were set out at some length during that debate, to which my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary replied.</p>
	<p>The two cases were Davies v. Braithwaite, decided in 1931, and, more recently, Hitchen v. Fall. I am not a lawyer and I shall not recite the details to the Committee. In the case of Hitchin v. Fall it was decided that the taxpayer should be taxed under schedule E, because he had a contract of service, not a contract for services. He was a professional ballet dancer engaged by Sadler's Wells. I accept that the courts might decide that people who are part of the corps de ballet or the opera and who perform regularly at Covent Garden or elsewhere should be taxed under shedule E, but that decision distiguished rather than overruled the decision in the previous case of Davies v. Braithwaite.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>489</span>
	<p>The facts were different and the courts decided that the taxpayer should be taxed under schedule D.</p>
	<p>Parliament set out general definitions of schedules D and E, so decisions have been made by the courts. The Inland Revenue, however, must take an initial view before such matters can be tested in the courts. There is contention about the history of that subject.</p>
	<p>The Revenue did nothing immediately after 1972, because it expected the taxpayer to appeal. The taxpayer did not appeal, and even then nothing happened for a long time. Recently, the Inland Revenue tried to prevent abuse of the schedule D rules by bringing people who were employed, but not self-employed, into the schedule E net. In the outlined case the Revenue used its powers legitimately under the Taxes Management Act 1970, but it went too far.</p>
	<p>Yesterday, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary answered questions about the authority for the Inland Revenue' distinction between performers and artists taxed under schedule E and those taxed under schedule D. My hon. Friend said that the change was based on decisions made by the courts and that there would be a transitional period so that long-standing schedule D tax arrangements would continue for the rest of the taxpayers' careers. That distinction was made, with the approval of Treasury Ministers, under the powers for the general care and management of income tax in the Taxes Management Act 1970. Parliament empowered the Revenue to make such distinctions, but if the Revenue goes over the top, Parliament should put matters right before the courts consider the case. If the Inland Revenue's decision was challenged by the courts, the proceedings would take time—lawyers rarely determine matters quickly and the case might go to appeal.</p>
	<p>Many injustices now exist. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales recently issued a guidance note that was agreed with the Inland revenue. It deals with many points that arise from the Revenue's decision and draws attention to anomalies. The most unfair aspect of te new arrangements for young actors who cannot show three years of schedule D tax returns is the treatment of their agent's commission. If an actor earns £100 and has to pay £10 or £12.50 to his or her agent, the net amount should be taxed, not the £100. It seems extremely unfair to tax the commission When all actors had schedule D tax status, they could claim their expenses for travel, subsistence and auditions. The change in the arrangements has resulted in unfairnesses, but the most blatant unfairness is the taxing of the agent's commission. Something should be done about that.</p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>There is also an unfair distinction between old and young actors. Old actors are well-established and some are relatively well-off, but young actors are new to the profession and have low incomes. The change applies only to actors in live theatre and does not extend to film or television. The existing regime will continue to apply to them. One might have thought that changes would apply to others working in the theatrical profession, but the guidance note makes it clear that there will be different arrangements for directors, designers and choreographers but not for their assistants.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>490</span>
	<p>We must decide how to deal with this confusing matter. Under my new clause all entertainers would be treated as schedule D taxpayers. I do not regard new clause 12 as a perfect solution, because all the facts about an individual should be taken into account when determining his taxpaying status, but it is the most sensible one. The Opposition have suggested an alternative in their new clause 22. They wish to retain the schedule E status but to extend the definition of expenses. I have reservations about my approach, but more about the Opposition's approach, because I am well aware of the pressure from many classes of schedule E employee to extend allowable expenses. That approach would lead to employees other than actors demanding the same treatment. I do not have a hard and fast view. We should try to reach a consensus. We cannot continue on the present basis, because it is unfair and will cause hardship. Something must be done to help young actors who will be hit hard by the proposals.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I support much of what the hon. Member for Beacons-field (Mr. Smith) said and wish to draw the Committee's attention to new clause 22. I do so with some degree of appropriateness, because much of the Inland Revenue change is a result of the Hitchin v. Fall case, involving a dancer at Sadler's Wells. Sadler's Wells is in my constituency. I am an unremunerated member of the theatre board and was at a board meeting earlier today. I also have in my constituency the Almeida theatre, the Tower theatre, the Kings's head theatre club and the Old Red Lion theatre, so I am well aware not only of the difficulty that many actors will face as a result of the Inland Revenue changes but of the strength of feeling in the profession about the Inland Revenue's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The starting point should be recognition of the unique nature of the acting and freelance journalist professions, to which new clause 22 draws attention. A sensible tax system should assess the work of a profession to ascertain which legitimate expenses should be considered and should then adjust the tax regime accordingly to get the proper and appropriate tax treatment for the job. The problem should be tackled by starting with the the nature of the work and then devising a tax system to deal with it, rather than starting with a global tax regime and fitting every profession into it. But that is what the Inland Revenue has done. By changing the status from schedule D to schedule E, with no ameliorating provisions in the nature of schedule E status, the Inland Revenue has created major problems for several professions, especially acting and journalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary will probably argue, as he did in the Adjournment debate on 27 February 1990, that if he gives way on one profession he will be on a slippery slope and will have to consider giving way to other professions. There are already exceptions to the schedule E expenses rule—some people are treated as schedule D taxpayers even though, in normal circumstances, they would qualify as employees. North sea divers are taxed under schedule D in accordance with section 314 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The exceptions include the concession under which postmasters' salaries are, in practice, taxed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>491</span>
under schedule D and consession A37, whereby partners' directors fees are taxed as schedule D payslip income. The Revenue has already made an exception on those cases and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and the Opposition argue that, because of the nature of the work undertaken by entertainers and journalists, the Revenue should be flexible about their treatment, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already a legal provision that has the effect of taking entertainers out of schedule E and into schedule D. Section 134 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 was originally enacted in 1975. It deems agency workers to be employees, but section 134(5)(a) states that the schedule E rule
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not apply—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) if the services in question are services as an actor, singer, musician or other entertainer or as a fashion, photographic or artist's model".</p></blockquote>
That provision in existing tax law was implemented three years after the Hitchen v. Fall case, which the Inland Revenue is quoting as the basis for the subsequent change. Therefore, three years after the case, the Revenue sought to put the principle into a legislative format. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield and I want to drag it back to a schedule D type assessment for expenses incurred by artists, actors and journalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal difference between schedules D and E relates to the expenses that can be claimed out of pre-tax rather than post-tax income. The Revenue wishes to implement a system that will throw up several difficulties and anomalies. What will happen to touring allowances? Let us take the example of a touring company which is based primarily at one location but goes on tour around the country half the time. Under schedule E rules, the Revenue will say that touring allowances made available to the actors in that touring company for the time they are touring will not be taxable—they will be deductible against their income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we should also take the example of a touring company that tours all the time and has no permanent base—for example the Cambridge Theatre Company. The two companies may be performing the same plays in the same locations with the same costs and touring allowances, but the touring allowances for actors in a company that tours permanently will not be allowable against tax because of the schedule E rules. Therefore, great anomalies will arise as a result of that change in relation to touring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield has already identified the problem of agents' fees, and I endorse all that he said. In response to representations made by Equity and by the Theatres National Committee, the Revenue has suggested that agents' fees could be paid direct by the management of the company that employs the actor. That would destroy utterly the proper relationship between the actor and his agent, a relationship that is crucial if the actor is to receive work from other employers in due course. The Revenue's proposed solution is not a sensible way of tackling the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed change will cause difficulties for members of the profession, for several reasons. Our new clause would tackle the problem from a different per-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>492</span>
spective to that of new clause 12. Instead of saying that everyone shall be on schedule D, the new clause states that the Revenue can have its way. However, even though those people will then be on schedule E, the schedule D definition of expenses should apply. The definition of expenses which are allowable against tax includes not just those which are wholly and exclusively incurrred in the pursuit of a profession but those which are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred. The tougher test applies under the schedule E rules. A slightly more flexible test is appropriate for people in the acting and freelance journalism professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a possible way out of the Government's dilemma. Replying in the Adjournment debate on 27 February, the Financial Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that the discussions between Equity and the Revenue will find some way of softening the treatment of what at present are expenses by recasting them in a way that will comply with the law and will mean that they are not expenses." —[Official Report, 27 February 1990; Vol. 168, c.254] </p></blockquote>
The new clause offers the Revenue exactly that potential get-out. The Opposition will support the hon. Member for Beaconsfield because his is a sensible way of tackling the problem.

If the Government do not find that solution acceptable, we offer an alternative. The problem will not go away. Actors and journalists need to be able to handle expenses sensibly, and they deserve somewhat better from the Committee and from the Government than the changes proposed by the Inland Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I must begin by declaring an interest in that five members of my family have belonged to Equity. I retired from the acting profession in 1947 on completing my third and last film, "The Huggets go to Holiday Camp". I was 18 months old. My father asked that I retire because he was frightened that I was being typecast as a baby. It has been said that I did not truly take up acting until I was elected, but that is a slur on all hon. Members in the Room. There is no acting in what I am about to say. It comes from the heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change in the tax law is not only unfortunate but potentially damaging to the acting profession. What do the changes cover? They do not cover actors engaged in the more popular, financially well-rewarded forms of the art. It does not cover actors in television or film or those who are established and well paid in the theatre. It covers only young actors who are new to the boards and who perform in a sector famous for the paucity of its pay and the extreme irregularity of its employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said, the change is consistent with the Inland Revenue's drive to transfer as many people as possible from schedule D to schedule E status. Like my hon. Friend, I too am a chartered accountant and, in the more than 20 yers since I qualified, have acted as an accountant for a number of people in various branches of what is called show business. My late father was severely disappointed when, in submitting a set of his accounts to the Inland Revenue, I did not claim the level of expenses that he felt should be set against his

income, but claimed those expenses that I, as an accountant, felt could be justified. I ceased being my father's accountant for the following taxation year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people would like to claim schedule D status. Abuse is still rife and many accountants have to educate their clients about the expenses that are allowed by statute or case law. Schedule D status is a great privilege. The taxation borne by right hon. and hon. Members is high and immediate. Before I was elected, I heard that the House of Commons had voted that Members of Parliament should not claim schedule D status. My first reaction was that these people were incompetent to run the country if they had given up such a prize. Nevertheless, it was an honest decision, in that our work is done in this place even though we are working on behalf of our constituents. I regularly have to tell my constituents, when they are disappointed that I do not attend as many local events as I wish, that I am the Member of Parliament for Richmond and Barnes in Westminster, not the Member of Parliament for Westminster in Richmond and Barnes. All right hon. and hon. Members face that pressure, but our job is here. This is where we work and our work in the constituency is an adjunct of that. We are accountable to our electorate for the way that we carry out our work, here. Therefore, I have no argument against paying schedule E or with the expenses that we can deduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The acting profession is different. Most actors perform their art in many different ways in any given year. A young actor in the theatre will be thrilled if he can pick up a job as a voice-over for an advertisement or can get a walk-on part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If a Member of Parliament picks up a voice-over or the odd broadcasting contract, his earnings will count as extra earnings under schedule D. The same is true for actors. Any extra work comes under schedule D. They are practising a trade, profession or vocation. For many of them, acting is more a vocation than a trade or profession and they can spend many months looking for work or "resting", as it is called.

Some of us have spent many weeks grappling with the problem. I regret that it was not put before me a year or two ago. I also regret that this laissez-faire attitude, which it is all too easy to adopt, may have meant that we are delaing with the problem with undue haste. The deadline of the end of the Committee stage of the Finance Bill is approaching, with the Report stage taking place in a week or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has been so ready to listen to those who wanted to speak to him on the issue. he has an important and difficult job. He has accepted representations from all sources including fellow Ministers and members of all parties. Sometimes the responses have not been particularly helpful, but they may simply have been the opening skirmishes of a battle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>494</span>
I wrote to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, suggesting that it was nonsense that agents' fees should not be deductible from actors' income for taxation purposes. My hon. Friend the Member for Beacons-field rated that as one of the most important matters and I agree with him wholeheartedly. The fact that 10 or 15 per cent. of an actor's salary can be deducted by an agent but not then related to his taxable income is utterly wrong. It is like a subscription to a professional body. In many cases, it is a fee that is paid before the individual can work. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The importance of agents commission was recognised in discussions the Inland Revenue had with representatives of the industry. But the agents commission is clearly an expense of finding work and is not incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment."</p></blockquote>
That is so utterly wrong that it is remarkable that my hon. Friend should have been advised to write it. An agent's job is not only to find work for an actor; it is also to maintain the actor while he is doing that work. If an actor is not able to ring up his agent to complain about the dressing room, the hours, the other actors, the digs or any other aspect of a job, the agent is not doing his work. Towards the end of his life, my father did without an agent. I sometimes think that although my father's death was miserably premature at the age of 50, it was perhaps not without convenience for him since he ceased to believe in not only agents but also Equity and the Inland Revenue. Therefore, he is probably happier than he would have been had he continued in his profession for a few more earning years. Most actors, however, rely desperately on their agent and the vast majority of agents do an honest job, as does Equity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equity, the actor's union, works very hard for actors. It treats actors in a paternalistic but healthy way and the Equity contract has managed to secure for actors many benefits that, were they genuinely totally self-employed, they would not normally receive. The Equity contract includes holiday pay, sick pay, arbitration for disputes and so on and looks much more like an employee's contract than an employer's contract, so I can see that there are problems when the Inland Revenue looks at the nature of an actor's employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agents' fees are certainly a continuing expense which must be regarded as deductible for income tax purposes. The money is deducted at source. It is not as if the actor ever sees the agent's fee—the money is never his. He cannot spend it; he cannot save it. Although he does not have to pay it while he is not earning, regular contact with the agent can be expensive in many ways. There is no doubt that the agent is working for the actor even if the actor is not working—my mother is available for employment if there is any agent listening. I understand the Revenue's difficulty, but I do not accept its decision on agents' fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned travelling expenses in the context of the case of Gurney v. Richards, which we discussed three or four weeks ago. I believe that the Inland Revenue has gone too far on the taxation of travelling expenses and that it errs on the side of meanness. One might have to tighten up the rules because otherwise the floodgates would be opened but I am not—and probably never will be—a Treasury Minister and therefore I believe that the Revenue is being mean.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>495</span>
I understand that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has to draw the line on travelling expenses somewhere, but I regret that the line drawn is overharsh, particularly in relation to the people we are discussing. If one has to do a job somewhere to earn money, one might choose to go from, say, Liverpool to St. Albans. I accept that many people work in many parts of the country, but when actors sign up for a run, they do not necessarily choose to work in different places. The nature of their profession means that, to get a different audience, they must travel long distances, far away from home, and stay often in uncomfortable digs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying anything against the quality of digs in some towns, but they are often not as comfortable as actors' homes. Then again, I know actors for whom digs are absolute luxury compared with their accommodation. The subsistance that actors get barely covers the costs that they must meet, and it would be unfair to tax that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Revenue decides that the taxation of the reimbursement of travelling expenses is to be regarded as a stopping point, actors will suffer with the rest of us. I regret that and I hope that the Treasury will do something about it, but I have come to expect that it will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third matter that I want to raise is the costs that actors incur regarding what might be called their self promotion. I understand that schedule E does not cover audition expenses or casting directory subscriptions, such as a quarter or a half page in "Spotlight" Casting Directory, which could cost £250 or £500. That would have to come out of a small amount of taxed income. Actors' photographs and biographs are expensive, but would no longer be deductible. That is regretable. Those costs could be offset against other income from other sources, which would be calculable under schedule D. I advise young actors to have other work against which to offset those expenses, which would not be deductible under schedule E if the Revenue maintains its current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my last point. It is sad that young new entrants into the theatre, who started after 5 April 1987 and are effectively apprentices, are being taxed under a harsher regime than those who have learnt their trade and are beginning to earn the fruits of the profession, and sometimes of fame. It is understandable that schedule E should apply to actors who have a run of more than six months in any production. It is defensible that the Revenue should maintain that a person appearing in a long-running television series, such as "Crossroads", should pay tax under schedule D if they perform regularly in one place. It is indefensible that actors should have to hand in a tax card at the beginning of the week to their employer—the theatre production company—have to ask for their P45 after five days as though they had been dismissed, have to take that P45 to their next employer perhaps two days later, and then have to repeat the bureaucracy so that the tax would begin again at that particular coding rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>496</span>
take many months to settle. I do not know how many months it would take for a peripatetic person who rushes around the country from employer to employer. That would be a bureaucratic nightmare for the Revenue and for theatre productions. A few days ago, a theatre producer told me that he would prefer to hire more experienced actors who did not have to have tax deducted at source. The hire new actors involves more bureaucracy. It causes more work to calculate nil tax rather than a rate of tax based on a coding that has been agreed, so one can understand why production companies would favour those more used to work than very young actors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Live theatre is the basis of all theatre, all performing art, film and television work. Some successful film and television actors go back to the theatre to recharge their theatrical veins and their skills. Performing in from of an audience is the life-blood of the performing acts. This bureaucracy will discourage young people who are starting off from understanding that the theatre is the important home of their art and it will encourage those leaving drama school to get a job in films or in television rather than in the theatre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much more work to be done. Equity must look at its contracts again and actors must be advised properly how they can, if necesssary, exploit the anomalies that the Inland Reveune allows them by taxing them under schedule D for most of their work but under schedule E for work in the theatre. That is tax avoidance, not tax evasion. By making that discretion, the Inland Revenue is setting up that tax avoidance for almost all time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sticking point is on agent's fees. If we can make progress on that today, we shall have been successful. If my hon., Friend the Financial Secretary promises to consider the matter before Report, I am mindful to support the Government at this stage, but if he does not react to the arguments put today and over the past few weeks, I shall reserve my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman's beautiful delivery of his most moving speech reveals what a tragedy the nation suffered when his acting career was brought to such a precipitate end at an unnecessarily early age. If I can assist in any way to help the hon. Gentleman to resume that career, perhaps even on a full-time basis, I shall certainly do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The many representations that I have received on this matter reminded me that my acting career came to an end in 1960 in the dining hall of a school in Macclesfield during a production of "Twelfth Night". The Producer is now the general manager of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He drew my embarrassed attention to the matter in a recent letter and was one of many who made a powerful case for not changing the tax treatment of actors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case was effectively set out in the Theatre's National Committee representation where it defined why an actor whould be taxed under schedule D. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A performer/artist should be viewed as carrying on his/her profession as a business; the performance of engagements being the end product. In order to manufacture and market their products, performers … have to incur varied and relevant expenses ranging
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>497</span>
from agents' fees, publicity costs and expenses necessary to maintain their professional standing and expertise".</p></blockquote>
The TNC goes on to point out that although standard forms of contract have been developed for mutual convenience
	<br><blockquote><p>"performer/artist's engagements should not be taken to be similar to the emploment of members of theatre staff such as programme sellers or technicians. The performer/artist is essentially a freelance contractor, undertaking"—</p></blockquote>
these are key words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"varied, sporadic and at times simultaneous engagements, often finding him or herself out of theatre work for long periods between engagements whilst expenditure on the promotion of the future of theatrical business continues."</p></blockquote>
That clear case describes many other categories who are taxed under schedule D and makes one wonder why the Revenue wants to treat actors and performers differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, why should actors and performers be treated differently from musicians, or are musicians the next to be given this treatment? There are many similarities between the two. In many cases, the same people will be employed—or engaged, to use the correct theatre word—in the same performance. They are not always divided between the orchestra pit and the stage, but engaged in a production in which the musicians and the performing artists are indistinguishable. Their circumstances are similar. Their engagements are sporadic, sometimes simultaneous, and their expenses in maintaining their professional capacity continue irrespective of whether they are in work. They have to engage in promotion, publicity and the promotion of agents to have work and any prospect of continuing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems faced by performers are particularly acute in provincial and rural theatres, which have developed so much in recent times. In my constituency, for example, the Northumberland Theatre Company, which performs in village halls and brings together not just a company of regularly engaged artists but others brought in for particular productions, is unable to pay high rates to performers. Most performers have to maintain all the expenses of being available for such productions on low incomes. Characteristically, many go from a production in one local theatre company or one group of village halls to another and then another in different parts of the country. They seek enough work to keep them occupied for enough of the year to have a viable income and remain in the tough profession to which they have committed themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those people are fortunate enough to get film or television work, they will be able to escape the trap of schedule D and be treated in the same way as existing performers, who will not be affected the provisions. I urge Minister to think again about a profession and a network of live theatre, as they could do considerable damage that would be felt more keenly in those small communities to which live theatre has been brought for the first time for generations. It is impressive to see a revival of live theatre, after all the bewailing and complaining for many years that live theatre was disappearing. The form of its revival has included small productions in many venues close to local communities. All that is threatened with serious damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
With this change, the Revenue will make a lot of work for itself. It will finish up dealing with a large number of short-term tax issues which are difficult to keep up-to-date, and it will have to employ more staff to cope with it all. As I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), many performers will find themselves on emergency codes because of the time taken to get the necessary papers into the tax system and into the right tax office. As Members of Parliament, we must all have had, often, to take up the problems of people on emergency tax codes such as people with families who are treated as single persons and have to pay the maximum rate of tax, sometimes for many weeks. That happens when people change jobs or are returning to work after a period of unemployment. It will happen a great deal with people who go in and out of engagements as often as actors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers' officials are always helpful when we bring such cases to their notice, but that must make Ministers aware of how cumbersome the system is likely to be in practice. Therefore, I ask Ministers to think again about a proposal that will be very cumbersome and damaging to the interests of live theatre, and discirminatory between different kinds of performers. It will discriminate against the performer at the beginning of his or her career, rather than those with an established career in film or television as well. I can see no advantage in the proposal for the general good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I ask my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to consider two paramount issues. The first is the distinction between theatre, television and film. I am not a tax accountant, but it seems that tax accountants will have to work out the difference between two people and the difference between one person's work in two disciplines. The actor who works in theatre and in television may use the same agent for both. That will cause endless problems with the tax system. I hope that my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter on which I have received much correspondence from acting companies and individual actors in my constituency. It is clear that their anxiety is real. The argument against the proposed changes has been put forward admirably, not least by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), although his speech contained one error. He said that he gave up acting at a very early age and did not take it up again until he was elected. Surely, knowing the Conservative party's selection procedure, his acting career would have begun again at his selection, rather than at his election, but he is a hard act to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman said. It cannot be disputed that an actor or performer is pursuing a business, and can therefore be considered as a freelance contractor. For that reason, the matter of expenses is very serious. Agents' fees are an equally serious but separate issue, but the taxation of expenses will have three primary results, of which the most important is that actors will find it more lucrative to leave the live theatre. The enjoyment created on a stage cannot be replicated by television or film. The future of the theatre will be threatened, as will the skills of young actors who wish to pursue a theatrical career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about the threat to regional theatre. The effect on touring companies has already been outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). Regional theatre is the lifeblood of the provinces, where quality of life would be severely diminished if people were denied access to good quality live performance. We must be careful that touring companies do not decide to give up travelling because it is more attractive simply to have a home base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth repeating that the treatment of stage actors appears anomalous when it is compared with that received by their colleagues who work as musicians or as actors in films and television. The reason for that differentiation is not clear, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to offer an explanation. It is illogical that the touring allowance for actors in a touring company is assessable for PAYE while the equivalent allowance for their musician colleagues is not. We must also remember that we are not talking about West End theatres, the famous actors who are household names or those who appear regularly on television. Most actors are relatively poorly paid and earn much less than we imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Citizens theatre in Glasgow is in my constituency. It produces aboiut eight plays a year, using about 10 actors on each. Those actors are engaged for a maximum period of nine weeks to cover rehearsal and performance. Although the Citizens theatre is one of the better known theatres in Glasgow and, indeed, in Scotland, the actors are paid £240 a week. Admittedly, that is more than they would earn working for other theatre companies that I have come across during my research for this debate. National insurance contributions of £18.38 must be deducted from that £240 and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>500</span>
if the actors are taxed at source, a further £45.50 is deducted. That leaves take-home pay of just over £176. These people are not highly paid. They may have spent three years training and may undergo lengthy periods of unemployment between engagements. In addition, the 10 per cent. agents' fee can be a considerable amount if a number of engagements are involved. An actor must continually refer to his or her agent to continue his on her employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many actors are obliged to base themselves in London or the larger cities where costs are considerable. They have to find temporary accommodation, which is expensive and difficult to obtain. Actors working away from home receive a flat weekly rate of £41 to cover all the extra costs of renting a second home, food, telephone and transport. As matters stand, that expenses allowance of £41 is to be taxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a letter from a small co-operative company in Cardiff, Hijinx theatre, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In real terms the performer will experience a decrease in his or her net income from theatrical work through taxation on expenses where there is no profit element involved for the performer … It is important to remember that there are many, many small-scale community and theatres in—education companies who can only afford to pay low wages".</p></blockquote>
Unlike the Citizens theatre in Glasgow, Hijinx theatre can pay its actors only £175 for a 45-hour week. Actors working for that company or others similar in size and achievement will strongly feel the effects of the Inland Revenue's change in taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several anomalies result from the Inland Revenue's recent decision. It is a matter not simply of stage actors being compared with television and film actors or actors being compared with musicians but of young actors being compared with older ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue's form dealing with the taxation of theatrical performers and artists is a questionnaire which has been issued to Equity members because of the changed situation. It refers not to young and old actors but to "established" actors. Presumably, young actors are to be unestablished rather than disestablished. After going through several complicated qualifications, the form answers the questions
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do I need to do anything else?"</p></blockquote>
by stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When an engagement ends your employer will give you a form P45. If you have been granted Reserved Schedule D status code NT should appear on that form. It is essential that you hand in this form to your next theatrical employer. If between engagements you claim unemployment benefit, hand the form P45 to the Benefit Office. When you find work, make sure you sign off immediately: you will then get a new form P45(U) from the Benefit Office showing code NT. Hand that to your next theatrical employer and you will then be paid without deduction of tax."</p></blockquote>
Actors will probably give up acting, rather than go through that process. As the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) said, it is an unnecessarily bureaucratic process which, I believe, is also quite unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should put an end to the anomalies and allow stage actors to be treated as favourably as their colleagues in film and television and as musicians. I hope that the Committee will accept one of the new clauses so that actors can be treated equitably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall not detain the Committee long in what has already been a lengthy debate. It is slightly strange that all Conservative members of the Committee who have spoken, except one, have been chartered accountants. I wonder whether this is the Conservative party's answer to the continual attacks on our profession by John Cleese. I was greatly impressed by the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). I cannot claim to have been a professional actor, but I have frequently claimed that my experience in my early twenties in amateur drama groups qualified me to be a politician. Were the House abolished tomorrow, competition in the acting profession would increase considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most points in this argument have been made from one side. As a chartered accountant, who has worked for many actors in the past, I hope that my hon. Friends will forgive me if the conclusions I reach from the same set of facts, differ from theirs. I agree, in the short term, with many of the comments that were made about agency and booking fees, because they are deductions from income. However, the law is by no means one-sided about such fees. In the'1950s and 1960s, it was common for someone seeking virtually any job to have to pay a fee to an agency. In no circumstances was such a fee ever deductible from the income that resulted from the work found. I suspect that we have come to believe that such fees should be deductible, because the acting and enteraining professions are among the last survivors of a system where such fees are payable. On that point, I challenge the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), who said that if the employer had to pay the fee, the relationship between the artist and agent would be destroyed. It is common practice in many professions, including mine for an agent to continue to act as adviser and accept a fee from the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also draw different conclusions from the facts about incidental expenses incurred by actors. The attempt in the new clauses to extend the definition of deductible expenses would open a large black hole into which a considerable amount of revenue could disappear. Why should the travelling expenses of peripatetic actors be treated as tax deductible, when the travelling expenses of peripatetic teachers who work for more than one authority are not? The travelling expenses of many other professions are paid out of net income. Actors, especially those new to the profession, have low incomes. In seeking to deal with the anomalies, we are studying their effect rather than their cause. I suspect that the solution lies not in bending already-stretched taxation rules to accommodate one or more professions, but in improving the pay and working conditions of members of those professions so that they can pay tax on the same basis as other employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes, I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary can offer temporary relief on agency fees. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes, I hope that the relief will move the payment of agency fees away from the employee towards the employer. The Committee has two duties—to look after the vulnerable group that we have discussed and to protect the interests of the public revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Most members of our profession are actors manqués, which explains the natural sympathy and respect we feel for a profession that has brought pleasure to many of us and prestige to our country. We recognise that often an actor's lot is not a happy one. Chronic oversupply means that all but a fortuante few face low pay and frequent periods of unemployment. We are bound to by sympathetic to members of the profession and to oppose anything that discriminates against entertainers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes that were recently introduced attempt to mitigate the impact of tax law. I must declare an interest, as two young members of my extended family who have lived under the same roof as me are newcomers to the profession. They are on different tours abroad, and I look forward to their return with trepidation, as they will discover the new tax treatment to which they may be liable. Therefore, I have a close personal interest in the matter.

It would be helpful if I—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—if I summarised the history of the changes and outlined the legal background. I shall also talk about the proposals that are before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the early 1970s, performers were in an ambiguous position. Most were treated by the Inland Revenue as self-employed for tax purposes and by the Department of Health and Social Security as employed for the purpose of national insurance payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early 1970s, the High Court decided that an engagement under a standard Equity contract constituted employment. The Inland Revenue did not implement that decision immediately because it believed that Equity would appeal, but it did not. The Inland Revenue began to tax newcomers working under standard Equity contracts as employees who were liable for tax under schedule E, pay-as-you-earn. But that treatment was introduced unevenly. In some districts, theatres began to deduct tax under PAYE, but in others, schedule D treatment continued. The disparities became apparent when actors moved to different districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1986, Equity protested and the new treatment was withdrawn in 1987 while discussions were held. It was expected that Equity might challenge the legal ruling, but again it did not. Equity did not propose alternatives, as originally promised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the Revenue notified the profession that the correct legal treatment of standard Equity contracts would have to be phased in nationwide. The Revenue offered generous transitional arrangements. It was proposed that the new treatment would be introduced over a generation, starting on 6 April 1990. All existing performers who had been treated as self-employed for the previous three years would be treated in that way for the rest of their lives. Some 13,000 actors have already registered for such treatment. However, newcomers are bound to be taxed according to the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
It is hard to conceive of a more gradual or more generous means of implementing an unwelcome legal decision; nor can the Inland Revenue be accused of having been precipitous in this matter, given the time that it has taken. I recognise, however, that the very generosity of the treatment of established actors inevitably creates a disparity between them and newcomers, but it is a disparity that could be avoided within the present law only be upsetting the long-established treatment of existing performers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the legal background against which we are working. Although the Inland Revenue has some room to manoeuvre, under its care and management powers under the Taxes Acts, in terms of how it introduces the correct legal treatment, it has no discretion about whether to apply the laws as laid down by the House and interpreted by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a vast diversity of working arrangements and circumstances in all the different occupations in this country, but tax law recognises only two broad categories of working arrangement. An engagement is either employment, in which case income is liable to tax under schedule E—pay-as-you-earn—or self-employment, in which case income is taxable under schedule D. The decision on which regime applies is not based on what the individual chooses to call himself. It is not a matter of discretion for the Revenue, nor is it a question of compensating for low pay or frequency of unemployment. The decision must be based on the objective characteristics of each engagement according to criteria which the courts have established and elaborated in a number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For entertainers, the question is whether the arrangements entered into under a contract such as the standard Equity contract, which I am holding up now, constitute employment or self-employment. Committee Members will see that that contract is a long, detailed, closely-printed 50-page contract. It provides for a weekly wage, overtime, sick pay, a minimum of two weeks notice of salary in lieu if a show closes early, a maximum number of perfornamces and hours of work per week, paid weeks out while on tour and holiday pay. It also provides for subsistence and touring allowances to be paid when the venue is more than 25 miles from home and for fares to be paid if the artist travels more than 15 miles. It requires the performers to work exclusively for the theatre unless given written pemission to do other work and requires the performer to act as directed. None of that is particularly generous or unusual, but Members of the Committee may well think that terms and conditions are characteristic of employment rather than self-employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Has the Minister never negotiated a contract for a self-employed person which contained a series of such conditions? Many such contracts exist for self-employed person engaged by one or several employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should be interested to see such contracts—so, I imgine, would the Inland Revenue, because it is on the basis of the terms and conditions of a contract, plus other circumstances of work, that a decision on whether someone is employed or self-employed has to be made. I would say that most self-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
employed people do not have all the features of the contract that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not like the conclusion that that contract and contracts like it constitute contracts of employment, what is to be done? What can entertainers and people in the entertainment business do? First, if Equity rejects the legal conclusion that its standard contracts are contracts of employment, it could challenge that interpretation by taking it to the tax tribunal and eventually to the courts. The hon. Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Battersea, South (Mr. Bowis) cast doubt on the applicability of the Hitchen v. Fall case to other engagements and circumstances. If Equity agrees with their doubts, it would by perfectly possible for it to challenge the Inland Revenue rulings. Equity has had over 15 years to launch such a challenge and seek a new legal interpretation, but it has not done so. As I said in the House earlier this year, the Revenue will co-operate in every way in helping to select and mount appropriate test cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second option is that entertainers could in principle alter the substance of their contracts and working arrangements to make themselves genuinely self-employed. They would have to take legal advice to do that and I imagine that many of the features of the Equity contract would have to be abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that entertainers, especially newcomers to the profession value those terms and conditions more highly than the potential benefits of taxation under schedule D. That is comprehensible. We should not urge, press or force them to change their contracts in that way. It is for them to decide. It is a genuine option. A significant number of different arrangements within the entertainment business are recognised as constituting self-employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) and other hon. Members mentioned employment in television and radio. Some such work is accepted as being self-employed because of the nature of arrangements. Something paralleling that might be envisaged in the theatrical world which could result in similar fiscal treatment. However, not all newcomers would wish to follow that road; and I cannot blame them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as I mentioned in an Adjournment debate, it would in principle be possible for entertainers to alter the terms of their contracts with agents so that they receive more favourable treatment. But Equity has considered that option and believes that the substantive change required would not be compatible with the established and valued relationship that actors have with their agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had lengthy discussions and exchanges with my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes about that. He has persuaded me that what I initially thought to be a good wheeze for solving the problem was not so good after all. It is understandable that actors do not wish to alter the established arrangements with their agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Failing such changes within the present legal framework, what changes in tax law could be beneficial to actors and, in particular, to newcomers to the profession? Which changes might be most acceptable? I shall not dwell on the more radical options like abolishing the distinction between schedules D and E
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
entirely. That would involve either a more onerous tax regime for 3 million self-employed, or a marked loss of tax revenue from 22 million employed people, or some combination of the two. Likewise, introducing a statutory definition of self-employment, instead of relying on case law would create many winners and losers; whether actors would be among the gainers would depend on how the definition was drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving everyone the option to choose whether they were self-employed or employed would clearly result in most people opting for the least onerous tax regime for their circumstances, with considerable—indeed enormous loss of revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now turn to the proposals outlined in the two new clauses. New clause 12 proposes simply to give all entertainers schedule D status by virtue of their profession, regardless of whether the terms of their engagement constitute self-employment or not. I have every sympathy with that objective. However, it would be extremely unwise to go down that route of settling the tax status of whole occupations by statue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, we would invite a host of applications from other groups seeking similar treatment; and I do not believe that we could or would resist their pleas. We would soon find ourselves allocating groups to different tax schedules, not on the ground of objective criteria, but according to our subjective response to their circumstances and, before long, their political muscle and lobbying skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know supporters of this clause will say "but actors are unique". That may be true, but there are plenty of other groups who are equally unique but in different ways, and there are plenty who have overlapping claims. For example, if we allow rock musicians to be granted schedule D treatment because some of them who travel a lot have heavy travel and subsistence costs and low pay, can we exclude their roadies who travel with them and are low paid? If we give special treatment to actors, could we avoid giving the same treatment to stage hands, lighting technicians and other stage technicians, especially those who accompany actors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of young actors in my constituency and I understand the problems that they may face with schedule E treatment of their travel and subsistence allowances when they work in distant theatres. But there are far more people working in my constituency who travel from Newcastle or Liverpool, and from other places with high unemployment, to work often for low pay in unstable catering and other jobs. They receive no travel or subsistence allowances from their employers and have to meet all their costs out of their taxed income. Can we really suggest that those people should bear a more onerous tax regime than actors simply because actors work in a more glamorous profession? We should soon have to extend any concession to them as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon. Members that the entertainments industry is not the only one knocking at my door, asking to be granted schedule D status by statute or by extra-statutory concession. Without digging very deep in my files before coming to the Committee, I came
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
across representations from music teachers, locum dentists, doctors, opticians, chemists, chairmen of tribunals, professional supervisors on building sites, market research interviewers, examiners, lorry drivers, consultants, contractors, freelancers, labour-only operators and agricultural workers. The problem is widespread and if I looked deeper in my files, I imagine that I should find many more representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Does not that make the case for voluntary self-employed status for everybody?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I made that point earlier. If it were voluntary, everybody would opt for the most generous treatment—in most cases, self-employment, but sometimes employment. The net result would be a huge loss of revenue and therefore higher rates of tax to make it good. That would not be attractive to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have mentioned that there is one obscure precedent for granting by statute schedule D status to an entire occupation—that of North sea divers. That was introduced by another Government in 1978 and I should not defend it. Apparently the position of North sea divers was thought to be unique, although the reason for taking such action is a little unclear at this late stage. I thought at first that it was because the costs of travelling to work on the ocean bed were considered particularly onerous, but it seems to have been due more to the strategic role of divers and the high death rate that afflicts their profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that hon. Members used that small group as a lever to try to grant a similar privilege to the larger group of about 40,000 actors and entertainers is a clear illustration of my point that we should not be able to stop there. If we were to grant schedule D status to the entertainers' profession, many other professions would soon be knocking at our door. Although I accept the intentions of my hon. Friends' new clause, we should not go in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oppostion new clause 22 would retain expenditure treatment for schedule D, with every other aspect being governed by schedule E. That is a positive contribution and I shall consider it positively. The new clause fails to achieve its objective as it would not remove the performance of duties test that is the key to the difference of treatment of many self-employed and schedule E expenses and so would not achieve what the Opposition seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Significantly, the Opposition have already thought to widen the ambit to include journalists as well as entertainers. Again that illustrates my point that we should never stop at one destination. They seek particularly to deal with the expenses of journalists. Of course, all members of the Committee hold that profession in high and unqualified esteem. Newspapers' costs for research and background work may be allowed when they can be shown to be necessarily incurred in the performance of a journalist's duties. That is a strict test that applies to every holder of the office of journalist. Some groups are testing that before the courts, and we must wait the outcome. However, expenses to put people in a position to work, rather than in the performance of work, is not differentiation unique to journalists. It reflects the cost of clothing,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
travel to work and all the other items that people might seek to claim against their earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major cost mentioned under this heading by Opposition Members and others are the costs of travel. Clearly as travel and subsistence are a significant cost for actors and performers, we should in principle be willing to consider it as an area of possible change. However, more people than those I listed on the issue of basic schedule D treatment, are knocking at my door for special and privileged treatment on travel costs. If we started a change that gave one group special treatment in relation to travel costs, others in analogous occupations would no doubt claim travel costs too. I was recently lobbied by draftsmen, who travel round the country in similar ways to actors, and would wish similar treatment. Once we allowed travel costs against employment earnings, we would dramatically reduce the tax base. Throughout the Committee both sides have been agreed that we should not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes is reported—possibly misreported—in the Evening Standard as having questioned why an actress and a prostitute who were tavelling side by side in a train to York should have different tax treatments for expenditure on train fares. I have been asked by my hon. Friend the Member for York to point out that an actress travelling to his archepiscopal city is more likely to be sitting next to a bishop than a prostitute. It does my hon. Friend credit that he should know more about the treatment for tax purposes of actresses than he clearly does of prostitutes, but neither would have expenses allowable against earnings unless they performed their profession on the train.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:They could have a have-it-way day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:As my hon. Friend says, they could have a have-it-away day. However, if we allow travel expenses against costs, there is a huge potential for applicants, and we should not allow it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have not succeeded in persuading me that we should accept the new clause. They have made an incontrovertible case that the lot of young performers is difficult, and not one that many of us would envy. Therefore, we have sympathy for them and I wish to help, but it is not easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members, particularly all my hon. Friends who have spoken, have emphasised that the single biggest cost that members of the acting profession have to bear and meet out of taxed income is agents' fees. I mentioned earlier that I had hoped that we could enable entertainers to solve that problem themselves by changing the nature of the engagement, and that has proved an unattractive option. However, they have continued to press that something should be done on this—the major single item that performers have to bear. Almost all members of the profession, particularly new entrants, have to bear that out of taxed income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sought hard to see whether there is a way in which we could help. Initially, as my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes said, I rejected the idea outright. However, he has obliged me to reconsider the matter, and it has to be possible—that is the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
directive I have given to my advisers—to introduce an arrangement whereby entertainers can claim against their income before tax the cost of their agents' fees. We have to find a way—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] of ringfencing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain what has persuaded a hardhearted Treasury Minister to envisage such a concession. There is a law to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury obliquely referred. In most professions, it is against the law for the agent to charge the employee; he must charge the employer for finding work. The principal exception is the entertainments industry. In recognition of the special conditions pertaining in it and the relationship between entertainers and their agents, we can use that rule to ring-fence a major concession so that we are not pressurised into emulating it elsewhere. I hope that 10 or 15 per cent. of the incomes of almost everyone with agents will be protected from suffering the full rigours of schedule D. I shall try to table a new clause or amendment on Report to implement a concession along those lines, and I hope that that is agreeable to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Financial Secretary left the best bit of his speech until the end. We welcome the proposed concession on expenditure on agent's fees—it would be churlish to do otherwise—but it does not go far enough. Although it tackles one problem identified by hon. Members, it do not tackle all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary ignored the fact that in some cases the travelling expenses of peripatetic doctors are deductible under schedule E. The most recent case of Pook 	<i>v.</i> Owen ensures that that happens. The deduction of such costs to actors would not be entirely anomalous because it now happens in certain other circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Financial Secretary was not entirely correct in pointing to the phrase.
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the performance of those duties'</p></blockquote>
in new clause 22 as being a block on what we seek to achieve. That phrase is required to retain schedule E status, but the key aim of the new clause is the removal of the "necessarily" condition that now exists for schedule E but not for schedule D. The Financial Secretary listed reasons why he was reluctant to regard the acting profession as a special case although, in making his final concession, he agreed that they are a special case. However, up to that point, he did not concede that actors are a special case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary's argument reminded me of the definition that Cornford gives in the Microcosmographia Academica of the principle of the wedge. The point always adduced by Treasury Minister—I suspect my hon. Friends and I may shortly fall into the same trap—is that if a concession is given to one group of workers in certain circumstances the floodgates will open. Cornford states that the principle of the wedge dictates that what is good should not be done now for fear of having to do something better in the future. The Financial Secretary's remarks reminded me of that principle. Actors are a special case, as was illustrated by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
Hanley). It is not simply a matter of agent's fees, although that is an important part of the argument and we are glad that the Government have given way on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Just how special do the Opposition consider actors? They also include journalists as another special case. Are those the only two special cases of which the Opposition are aware?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:As far as we are aware, those are the only two cases in which the present circumstances create obvious anomalies. They need to be corrected. The Financial Secretary's concession does not take account of the overall unique position of the two professions, nor does it tackle the other anomalies and difficulties, such as touring allowances and audition expenses. It does not tackle the discrepancy between stage and television actors. It does not take account of the exceptions that already exist for North sea divers and for some other professional groups. It does not recognise that the most serious difficulties will be experienced by young actors and by those who perform in the regions rather than in the large cultural centres. They will be adversely affected even after the proposed concession on agents' fees has been brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome that concession, but it does not solve the whole problem. The Government will do only half their job if they stick at that. We want to push them to do more for a deserving profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:We have had an excellent debate, with some highly informed contributions. My hon.

I made it clear that, although the current treatment of actors is unfair in several ways, the most blatant and obvious unfairness is the one described by my hon. Friend. The Committee has been offered a most substantial and welcome concession. In those circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to press the new clause.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enough of intellectual competition, Mr. Cormack, new clause 49 deals with a much more prosaic matter—benefits in kind. The beneifts in kind rules were introduced in 1976. Until 1989 it was generally accepted that when the benefit was of such a kind that the employer would have incurred most of the expenses anyway, the rules meant that only the small extra costs incurred on top of those inevitable costs were taxable as a benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main aspects of employment to which that applied were education and transport. If a transport company would have operated its scheduled services anyway, it was accepted that allowing its employees or their families to use spare space was not a taxable benefit. If a school allowed its masters' sons or daughters cut-rate education at a fee-paying school, the taxable benefit was limited to the extra cost of books, food, repairs and other such expenses provided again that only capacity that would otherwise have been unused was used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation altered after Pepper v. Hart in 1989, when it was decided that section 156(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 went further than practice until then. The judge decided that all costs should be taken into account in calculating the taxable benefit, irrespective of whether they would have been incurred anyway. The case involved nine schoolmas-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
ters at Malvern college, which, I hope, will draw some sympathy from Conservative Members who are no longer paying attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ramifications of judge's decision go wide and tend to affect lower-paid employees who are covered by the benefits in kind legislation. I understand that tube drivers have free underground passes, which they can use at weekends and to travel home at night. Following the Pepper v. Hart case, if a tube driver were one of, on average, 10 passenegers on his journey home, he could, in theory, be taxable on 10 per cent of the apportioned costs of operating that train on that journey. It would be bizarre if that happened. The new clause would ensure that it will not. The administrative problems of enforcing that judgement would be immense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can follow the example to its ridiculous conclusion. If the tube makes an operating loss despite charging 70p for the shortest journey, the potential taxable benefits are enormous. The entire losses could be divided among the people deemed to be beneficiaries. The position is bad enough for those who get concessionary travel on the tube, but those who work for British Airways who occupy spare seats on flights would be even worse off. If they were the only passengers on a scheduled flight to New York, because it was a return flight or for some other reason, they could be liable for the entire operating costs, which would be ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new clauses would ensure that the Inland Revenue do not pursue the judgment in the case of Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart to its logical and—for some people—pretty expensive conclusion. It would turn the law back to where it was thought to be before that case. There would be no cost to the Exchequor in that, because the law was thought to be other than was decided in that case. However, the cost to the Exchequor of pursuing that judgment to its logical conclusion, and of chasing the alleged debts to the Revenue, could be substantial. More substantial still would be the ill will and the unfairness that would be generated.

Perhaps the Minister who is to respond to the debate will not accept the new clause but will offer the Committee some other reassurance—if so, all well and good. Our new clause would return the law to where it stood between 1976 and 1979. That interpretation operated to the prefect satisfaction of of both political persuasions. We consider that a reasonable objective, and I await the Financial Secretary's response with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:There is some misunderstanding about that case, although I appreciate that the Opposition have rightly highlighted an important aspect of tax affairs. It is not true that, before the ruling to which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) referred, the understanding of the law was different. The court upheld the Revenue's interpretation, which was neither new nor changed but which had been accpted for some time. The changed that is going on progressively is in connection with the £8,500 rule—the de minimis rule, as it were, below which P11D forms do not have to be completed for benefits in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
kind. Because that amount is frozen and therefore declining, both in real terms and as a proportion of incomes, more and more people fall liable to a decision on the benefits in kind that they received when their incomes were less than £8,5000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy is to allow the value of the £8,500 limit to decrease in real terms because there is widespread agreement that people should pay tax on their income, whether that income be in cash or in kind. However, difficult decisions sometimes have to be made, and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East has highlighted some. He has suggested that an underground worker should pay his share of the cost of running a train. If there are only 10 people, that worker would have to pay a tenth of the cost of running the train.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not suggesting that. That could be the case if the judgment were followed to its logical conclusion. I certainly do not propose that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry. I did not mean to misrepresent the hon. Gentleman. He made his point very clearly, and I did not. The hon. Gentleman believes that that is the direction in which the Revenue is taking the ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue's approach to assessing receipts of benefit in kind has tended to be based not on each and every item, but on the average cost of the benefit over the year. It is often possible to measure that average by the cost to the employer. There are difficulties in some cases when there is a difference between average and marginal costs. People who work in retailing are at present not taxed if they receive from their employer goods at the wholesale cost. They would be disadvantaged under the new clause because they would be taxed on a higher cost. I am sure that that is not the intention of the proposal and it would be unwelcome to the employees of Marks and Spencer and many other retail establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pepper 	<i>v.</i> Hart decision was made in the High Court. It is going to appeal and it would be sensible to await the outcome of that appeal to see what is said. Often, what is said is more important than the specific yes or no judgment that it may be summarised as. It is my intention, and, I believe, that of the Revenue, to wait for the outcome of that case and investigate any implications that it may have. For that reason, I would like to take precipitate action by endorsing the new clause or anything like it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We do not want to disadvantage relatively low paid workers over the small sums involved in, say, travel arrangements.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is introduced in the context of a crisis in the British film industry. Investment has slumped
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
from about £220 million five years ago to about £65 million last year. Three years ago, 54 films were made in Britain—last year, only 27 were made. The position this year is likely to be even worse. In this country, more money is spent on making commercials than on making films and television programmes. Those are the depths to which we have sunk. The Ealing comedies and Gainsborough movies which so delighted filmgoing audiences in the past have been replaced by talking bears and Nick Kamen getting in and out of his jeans. Those are the priorities now and I suppose that it is a matter of taste. However, it must be a matter of regret that the British film industry is no longer what it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the crisis on 30 May, my hon. Friends the Members for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) and for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) announced the new package of assistance that our party intends to provide for the film industry. We believe that it is vital to build up our film industry, which is experiencing considerable difficulty, into a strong and healthy industry. No sooner had we announced that package and foretold the new clause which would develop the business expension scheme, the Prime Minister tried to get in on the act. She called a meeting at 10 Downing street, which was attended by the scions and moguls of the film industry. I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause, because at the end of the seminar, during which representatives of the film industry had painted a clear picture of the crisis that gripped it, the Prime Minister turned to one of those present, and in a memorable scene, worthy of the silver screen, wrung her hands and asked, in anguish, "Why, oh why, Sir Richard didn't you tell me this before?" Sir Richard immortally replied, "You never asked me, darling."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is the last day of the Finance Committee and the Opposition believe that Conservative Members should be given an opportunity to speculate about other matters in which the Prime Minister might be similarly involved. The Chief Secretary appears interested—he has clearly heard the Prime Minister speaking in a similar vein. The Opposition will donate a prize to any Conservative Member who provides an example of another "why, oh why" predicament that is relevant to our discussions. For example, "Why oh why, John, haven't we joined the ERM before?" "Because you wouldn't let me, honey." The opportunities are endless. We shall not give a magnum of champagne, because that is not our style. The prize will be a six-pack of Guinness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to wring her hands at the state of the British film industry now. The Government could have done much more to avoid that sad pass. The modest new clause suggests a proposal, linked to the business expansion scheme, and which the Government could accept if they seriously wished to help the British film industry and prevent similar heart-rending scenes from taking place at 10 Downing street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would ensure that, under the amended business expansion scheme, the Treasury
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>517</span>
and the Revenue would be empowered to issue appropriate regulations that would allow investment by companies as well as individuals. It would also ensure that the upper limits for relief were high enough to meet the levels of investment that we wish to encourage in the film industry. Subsction (1) would allow an individual tax relief on investment in an approved film production company of up to £80,000 a year, or if greater, 25 per cent. of his or her income. Those figures are specified in subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to return the business expansion scheme to its original function, which we promised that we would give a fair wind to all those years ago when my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) was Opposition spokesman for Treasury matters. [Hon. Members: "That was a long time ago."] It was a long time ago. People may not remember that part of my hon. Friend's past but at that time, we were prepared to take the BES at face value. It was genuinely about encouraging risk investment. We believe that there is no more proper use of the scheme in this context than the film industry. That is why we seek to give individuals that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise we seek in subsection (2) to allow relief to companies making such investments but we want it limited, as proposed in subsection (6), to £1 million per group of companies or, if greater, 25 per cent. of group profits for the year. Those subsections would provide the flexibility that we believe necessary if the new clause is to fulfil its purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are conscious of the dangers of abuse. We have always believed that the BES must not be used as a haven for moneys as a means of avoiding the impact of tax for the purposes of a speculation or evasion. Therefore, any deduction would be restricted to the time that the Inland Revenue issued a certificate stating that it accepted that 95 per cent. of the money raised in the period in question had been spent on qualifying activities. So the Inland Revenue could supervise matters and ensure that the money was spent on the purposes for which the relief had been granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would also ensure that relief was only granted once the money had been spent on or allocated to specific film productions That would encourage investors to monitor how the companies were spending their money. That is a good thing as it would ensure financial accountability and investors' involvement in the industry.

He will recall that one of the major tax avoidance schemes in the book involves financing the film industry in a similar way to that proposed by the new clause. Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has fallen into a trap. It might have been possible to propose changes to capital allowances, but we deliberately chose not to. I hope that we shall not see a return to those bad old days. The hon. Gentleman is right to ensure that such a proposal should not be developed. To seek to amend and refine the business expansion scheme, which is currently the source of considerable abuse in relation to property when it serves as a shelter for moneys that would otherwise be subject to tax, is in the original spirit of BES. That is why David Puttnam feels free to commend it as he does. Subsections (8), (9) and (10) of the new clause would impose such control on this form of relief to ensure that it is not abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7A)(g) would stop an approved film production company financing films on terms that would give it a small guaranteed return, or even a loss, to provide investors with a guaranteed post-tax five-year return. That would be dangerous if it were not for the fact that an AFPC may be approved only if, as far as commercially possible, it undertakes as much risk as anyone else associated with the films it produces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (8), (9) and (10) would further limit the impact on relief. Subsection (8) would permit that, as with BES, relief is available only for subscriptions for shares and not for loans. Subsection (9) would allow an AFPC to invest in other film production companies, which we do not believe is open to abuse. Subsection (10) would ensure that relief is preserved only if the whole investment is kept for five years and the AFPC retains its status for that period. Those safeguards will make the BES, as amended, the vehicle for the recov-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I understand that in the comedy boutiques of San Francisco, which are characterised by lively exchanges between the audience and the comedians, the worst insult that can be hurled at a comedian on stages is, "Derivative, derivative." I should never say that of the jokes of the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), but I must say that his anxiety for the film industry is, "Derivative, derivative." The Opposition tabled these new clauses on the day of the seminar of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. To suggest that that seminar was provoked by the morning's amendment paper is a little far fetched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is also derivative in that it is based clearly, almost parrot fashion, on the French scheme SOFICA—Société pour le financement de l'industrie cinematographique et audiovisuelle. That scheme is perfectly reputable, but it exists in a country that does not have the business expansion scheme, and bears the stamp and character of that. It is clear that BES has many advantages that SOFICA does not: it gives capital gains tax relief; it does not cause, as the new clause would, the investor to lose all his relief if the company went bust or the film failed to make money; and there is a limit of £40,000 on the relief that an individual can receive against tax from investment in a BES scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Oppostion's enormous outrage at the use of the £40,000 relief under the existing BES scheme, the new clause proposes that investors in the new film scheme could get relief of up to £80,000, whatever their incomes. If they had an income of £80,000, they could wipe it out entirely. If they had a larger income, they could get relief on up to a quarter of it. With an income of £1 million, they could get relief on £250,000 by investing in that device. I do not object to that in principle, but I do object to the Opposition saying one thing and then proposing another. There is such a clear conflict between the new clause and what has previously been advocated in Committee, that I cannot help but point out the contrast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced as a result of her seminar that the British Government would provide £5 million over the next three years to help British producers who seek to enter European co-productions. The Government will provide, as requested by Sir Richard Attenborough, £150,000 to support this year's European film awards in Glasgow in December— a decision that was welcomed by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central, (Mr. Watson). A working party chaired by the Department of Trade and Industry is being set up to examine the structure of the industry and how to attract greater private-sector finance to United Kingdom film production, and is to report back in the autumn.

The industry, at its suggestion, proposes to explore whether changes are needed in the tax regime for film production, and to report to Treasury Ministers over

the next few months. That is an importnt announcement. Obviously, we should wait to hear what the industry has to say. In the past we have twice modified the basic scheme as a result of representations from the industry, to make it more film-friendly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It was a purely rhetorical statement by the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). However, it gave rise to the substantive question of what the Labour party would give. It would be interesting to see the obvious desire of the hon. Gentleman to dish out more lolly restrained temporarily by the presence of the shadow Chief Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appropriate action on taxation of the film industry is to wait until the film industry has decided whether any changes in the present regime are necessary and whether there are any unintended ways in which the tax system bears on film finance which should be changed or improved. We could then respond accordingly if positive proposals were put forward. The time is not ripe to produce a simple shadow of the French scheme which was produced in different fiscal circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I want briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) and to oppose the comments of the Financial Secretary. I declare an interest, in that I do a fair amount of work in the House for the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians, which provides support to my constituency Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that the Chief Secretary is present for the brief debate on the film industry. He will recall, as I do, the hours athat we spent discussing the film industry on the Films Act 1985. As a trade Minister at the time, he piloted that Bill through Committee. That Bill abolished the Eady levy, got rid of the National Film Finance Corporation and set up the present system of film support, which is causing such concern throughout the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Financial Secretary is in the business of throwing accusations about people and parties who say one thing and propose another, we have only to look at the way in which the Chief Secretary at that time rejected outright any proposals for additional taxation and other forms of support for the film industry. Four to five years later we find that the Prime Minister herself, in her Downing street seminar and in the subsequent press release, is advocating that the tax regime should be looked at to see how it could be used for better support of the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
That support is needed: the figures speak boldly for themselves. In 1985, theatrical productions of feature films in Britain were 58 and theatrical investment was £330 million. In 1989—four years later—the number of productions has fallen to 58 and investment to £165 million. As of June 1990, only 28 theatrical features are scheduled for the year, compared with 38 last year. So, over the past five years, since the changes introduced by the Chief Secretary in the Films Act 1985, there has been a steady decline in the number of feature films produced in Britain and the amount of investment in film production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as film production has fallen, attendances in the cinema have risen dramatically. In 1989, cinema attendances were 96.4 million, which was the fourth consecutive annual increase and represented a 14.5 per cent increase over the previous year. In the first five months of this year there has been an 8.8 per cent increase in the number of admissions. Film watching is rising but film making in Britain is contracting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasingly, the feature films that the public go to the cinema to see are being made abroad rather than in Britain and it is against that background of declining production in the film industry that the Prime Minister's package must be viewed. A sum of £5 million over three years compares very badly with the scale of subsidy that France, West Germany, Australia and other countries provide for their film industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:How much would a Labour Government spend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:By direct intervention in the film industry and by fiscal measures, such as the new clause proposes, a Labour Government would provide a greater boost to the film industry than will be provided by the Prime Minister's suggested support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the present situation is clear. The ratio of domestic films to Hollywood films seen in Britain, as shown by box office admissions, is virtually the lowest of any comparable country. In Britain the ration is 15:80; in West Germany, 23:64; in Italy 29:57; and in France, 39:46. Britain is bottom of the league in the quality production of feature films seen by the public in British cinemas, and that is happening when cinema admissions are rising and production is declining. It behoves the Government to be much more forthcoming and serious than even they have been in the immediate wake of the Prime Minister's much-publicised seminar. They should look at ways to promote the film industry. They have not done enough yet and our new clause offers a mechanism for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To spend money in that way would be a more worthy use of the business expansion scheme. It would regenerate the film production industry, which is one of our key industries. That is more important than using the money to provide private rented accommodation.

	<div class='title'>SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEMES: REORGANISATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"In relation to a savings-related share option scheme, Paragraph 15(5) of Schedule 9 to the Taxes Act 1988 shall have effect, and shall be deemed always to have had effect, as if for '1989' in that subparagraph there were substituted '1991'."—[Mr. Boateng.]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauuse is motivated by a desire to ensure that the arrangements for tax relief on employee share schemes will encourage a wider take-up by employees in all such schemes. You, Mr. Cormack, will be aware that, at present, of the three sorts of schemes which attract tax relief in relation to profit sharing, there is a much higher take-up of executive share options than of all employee schemes. Indeed, the Charterhouse remuneration survey calculated that more than 90 per cent. of top directors received share options while, in contrast, fewer than 10 per cent. of workers who could benefit from share schemes in the United Kingdom are included in such arrangments. That is unjust and we believe that there is a role for wider share ownership by employees in increasing and enhancing industrial democracy through the involvement and participation of workers in their enterprises. With the new clause, we seek to remove one obstacle to that enhanced take-up which, in equity, should be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To outline the position, in 1987, all share option schemes were allowed to provide for options to be rolled over if a company reorganised its structure, as will often be the case when groups believe that it is in their interests to do so, or when they are taken over. The 1987 legislation provided that when the scheme rules were changed, the changed rules could also apply to existing options, but only if they were changed before 1 August 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
The result of that restriction, which was not well publicised at the time, was that if such a scheme now changes its rules and reorganises or is taken over soon after, option holders at the time the rules were changed suffer a tax penalty. Generally, to avoid that, they must exercise their options to the limited extent to which they are able, and pay tax on the profits made. That would not be the cause of over great anxiety under executive share option schemes, when senior management can look after itself. It can always take out new options afterwards to limit the damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same cannot be said for ordinary employees. As the Adam Smith Institute explained, there is a difference in the culture governing investment making decisions for ordinary employees from that for senior management. Such decisions would cause problems for lower paid employees in SAYE schemes. Those employees would be unlikely to know anything about the opportunity offered in the 1987 Act which, as has been said, was not expecially well publicised and had no time limit placed on it. Under statute, if those employees exercise their options on takeover, they can use only whatever amount, without bonuses, had been saved in their SAYE plan. Potentially, they stand to lose a great deal of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the nature of all employee share ownership schemes, the employees will have only a limited amount of money in any event. We are dealing with a group of people who are not necessarily used to making risky investments. As the Adam Smith Institute pointed out, they would be using a high proportion of their wages on basic necessities. They can ill afford to lose a great deal of money which, potentially, they will if the scheme is not amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would give SAYE schemes, but not executive schemes, another bite of the cherry. It would allow them to safeguard their employees' benefits in the event of a takeover or reorganisation if they change their rules prior to 1991, by which time most of the pre—1987 SAYE schemes will have matured. The new clause is reasonable and one on which I imagine there would be some, if not complete, consensus in Committee. I hope that the motion will be accepted by the Minister in that spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Richard Ryder)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In 1987, the Government introduced the provision that could enable an approved share option scheme to permit an option holder to roll-over approved options if the company whose shares are the subject of the options is taken over by another company whose shares also qualify under the legislation, to which the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) has just referred. In effect, that put approved share option schemes onto the same footing as the approved profit sharing scheme, for which there was already a comparable provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a roll-over facility is of assistance where the acquiring company wishes to encourage the employees of the target company to continue to work for the success of their company in its new circumstances and to ensure that their commitment will be to the new corporate parent as well as to the target company itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
The facility was made available only on the basis that scheme participants should be no worse off and no better off than if the takeover had not occurred and they had simply continued with their existing options over shares in the target company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appreciated, of course, and catered for the interests of company schemes and option holders already in existence at the time of the change. The transitional arrangement that is at the centre of the new clause was introduced to amend the rules of schemes approved before 1 August 1987, so that existing option holders would not be excluded. But the amendment had to be made by 1 August 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware that that generous two-year time limit has been the source of widespread genuine concern or difficulty. I am told by officials that all companies with an approved scheme were issued with a written reminder on that point in the form of a notice incorporated in the annual returns despatched to scheme employers in April 1989.I am also told that the imposition of a time limit has not attracted widespread adverse comment. Nor has it been the focus of representations from companies or representative bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I must ask the Committee to reject new clause 56. It is unnecessary to act in the way proposed by the hon. Member for Brent, South. Even if that were not the case, it would create an unjustified disparity of treatment between the savings-related share option scheme and the discretionary share option scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:We are not satisfied that that disparity would be unfair. Insofar as it exists, the disparity relates to the take-up of benefits under the relevant scheme and to the introduction of schemes. That should be a matter of concern to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should be aware of a survey by Pacer and Co. of employee participation in new issues. It was found that, of 122 companies floated on the stock market and the unlisted securities market during 1988, 92 per cent had an executive share option scheme, whereas only 15 per cent had a scheme that included all employees. That is an imbalance in existing treatment in relation to take-up and benefits and the start-up of new schemes. It is unfavourable to the ordinary worker who seeks to enhance his involvement in the firm by the ownership of shares—something that the Government have emphasised. The Minister has not argued against this small and eminently reasonable new clause either on principle or its ability to achieve its ends. This is not one of those debates in which people say that the new clause is nice but technically flawed. The Minister has said that it is not technically flawed, but that it should not be acepted because not sufficient people have complained. The majority of people who might benefit from a scheme of this nature are not the sort of people who have accountants to advise them of the whys and wherefores of such legislation.

New clause 16 deals with the secondary market in sovereign debt which we discussed in the debate on clause 66. There is no doubt whether stamp duty is payable on transactions involving sovereign debt, so the transactions are being carried out in New York and not in London. Price Waterhouse, which is the leading firm of chartered accountants and business advisers in the United Kingdom, and to who I am an adviser, kindly drafted the new clause which would put the law beyond doubt. It would not involve a lot of revenue and I hope that my hon. Friend will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I support the new clause presented by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that a problem arises from the definition of a person in existing legislation and the fact that it is possible that cicumstances may occasionally arise when a disposal on the secondary market of a less developed country's debt might become liable for stamp duty, whereas it seems that the Government

The main secondary market in sovereign debt is in the United Kingdom but, as he correctly said, the documentation is carried out largely in New York because of uncertainties that arise which mean that, just possibly, some of the debt could incur stamp duty in certain circumstances. However, I am not persuaded that the new clause would resolve that important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises partly because of uncertainty about how the definition of loan capital will apply, but part of that definition relates to capital raised by a body corporate or other body of persons. That part of the definition must be interpreted in the light of foreign law in the country concerned and that creates problems, so we must examine the matter closely. We have decided to review it, but that is not possible in a timescale that would enable us to bring forward a clause to deal with the immensely complicated area of stamp duty before Report.

The new clause deals with beneficial loans. If a bank employee has a cheap mortgage—at an interest rate of, say, 5 per cent.—the Inland Revenue naturally seeks to tax that person on the difference between that and the commercial rate. A problem arises where employees of banks and building societies are borrowing not at a cheap rate but at the commerical rate, so they are getting no benefit but having to pay tax on a nonexistent benefit. The reason for that is that the rate of interest that is deemed to apply is calculated not in relation to mortgages only but more widely, so it tends to be above the normal commercial mortgage rate. At present it is 16.5 per cent. The employee will be taxed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
on the difference between that rate and the actual rate that he is paying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people would be affected by the new clause and the union has written to me in support of it. [Hon. Members: "What union?"] The union would like the whole measure to be abolished. It does not even support the idea of taxing the benefit in kind provided by cheap loans, but I do not go as far as that. However, I think that it is wrong to tax a benefit that does not exist. The people who would be affected include 66,000 employees of building societies. This is a simple matter to put right, and we should do that here and now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I rise, in what is becoming a dangerously familiar mode, to support the arguments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). He has identified a probelm. The Opposition accept that if a bank employee has a mortgage on which he pays 5 per cent interest and the general mortgage rate is 15 per cent, that employee should be taxed on the benefit of the difference between the two. Let us suppose that a bank employee obtains a mortgage from his or her employer at 15 per cent while the general mortgage rate is 15 per cent. The Inland Revenue says that it assumes that the income benefit is the difference between 15 per cent and a notional figure that it plucks out of the air, 16.5 per cent. That is neither right nor fair. The way in which the Inland Revenue calculates the deemed rate of general interest—the rtate that the Revenue thinks should be paid—is anomalous and unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue was put extremely well in the letter written on 14 June by the general secretary of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union to the Chancellor. The general secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is clearly unjust for any member of the public to be paying tax on benefit that they do not actuality receive."</p></blockquote>
The tax is assumed to be due on a benefit that is not actually received by the employee. If the mortgage rate available to the employee is below the going normal rate for the general public, we have no objection to the Inland Revenue levying tax on the actual benefit. However, to create an artificial tax liability by deliberately raising the deemed normal rate beyond the actual figure is niether sensible nor fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of technical defects in the new clause—in particular, the lack of a starting date. It is not clear whether it would be applicable restrospectively. Despite that technical defect, we believe that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has identified an important principle. I hope that the Government will consider it, to put it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I begin by conceding to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) that the rules operate with a pretty broad brush. They do not attempt a precise measure of the benefit on each loan to which they apply, but they have the great advantage of simplicity and certainty and avoid the potential morass of trying to determine what is a true "commercial rate" on each individual loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules work by comparing the interest paid on a loan with the interest that would have been paid at a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
benchmark rate—the official rate. This is set at only 1.5 per cent above average bank base rates. As a result the official rate is very much at the lower end of the range of commercial interest rates for consumer items and other unsecured lending. Normally the average official rate each year would be close to typical mortgage rates, but in the present unusual market conditions the gap between the official rate and the typical nominal average rate is larger than usual. In the last tax year, the official rate was, on average, 1.7 per cent above the typical mortgage rate. The gap has narrowed recently to just over 1 per cent and in the longer term the relationship between the official rate and typical mortgage rate may well return to the previous pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most building societies and banks lend the first £30,000 to £50,000, or even more, on mortgages to their staff at a very generous subsidised rate—typically 5 per cent In these cases it would be misleading to suggest that the present rules were bringing into tax loans wholly at a commercial rate. The fact that the last tranche of borrowing is at a normal commercial rate does not change the fact that, overall, the mortgage lending is on favourable terms. In such circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for a tax charge to arise, although I appreciate that the present rules, by their nature, may overestimate the benefit to some degree. I concede that point to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present rules contain an exemption for loans or parts of loans eligible for interest relief and a de minimis limit of £200 benefit below which no tax is payable. Those exemptions mean that some home loans exceeding £30,000 will not give rise to a tax charge in practice, even with the present difference between the official rate and typical mortgage rates. For example, if the official rate were to stay at its current level for the rest of the year—I am, of course, not making a forecast, but simply illustrating an arithmetical point—an employee with a home loan entirely at a rate of 15.5 per cent and no other loans from his employer would come into tax only if his loan exceeded about £50,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would substitute a subjective approach in place of the present wholly objective rule. It does not, for example, define what is meant by a "class of loan", nor is it self-evident that loans in a particular class made to outside customers and employees should necessarily be regarded as comparable. The terms on which a loan is made to an employee may be much more favourable than one made to a third party in relation to such important matters as security and repayment terms. In principle, factors such as those should also be weighed to decide whether the interest rate is on a strictly commercial basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemption proposed in the new clause could apply only to the staff of employers whose trade includes the lending of money. It has the effect of providing especially favourable rules for the employees of financial institutions. As I explained, most employees of financial institutions with mortgage loans benefit from substantial discounts on the normal customers rate. Under the new clause they would enjoy in addition a fiscal advantage not available to taxpayers in general.

I give my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury a firm commitment. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has had correspondence with various representative bodies in which he stated, as I am saying today, that we shall take account of the argument raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield as well as any new information that comes to light during the next few months. We shall do so before the next Finance Bill is introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Economic Secretary's response to the new clause was very thin. He said that the 1.5 per cent above base rate method of calculation of the official benchmark rate—which is the problem—was at the lower end of the range of commercial interest rates. By saying that, he ignores the fact that the principal form that such a benefit takes for an employee is through a mortgage. The official benchmark rate of 16.5 per cent represents the upper end of the range of mortgage rates available from banks and building societies on the open market. The problem arises because the Government consider a range of other interest rate calculations and say that they are being generous by fixing on the figure of 16.5 per cent, but in relation to mortgages they are not being generous. I do not think that the Economic Secretary's point holds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made much of the point that mortgages are available for most employees of banks or financial institutions at a substantially lower rate than the going rate for the general public. I am sure that the Opposition and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield accept that the difference between that and the real going rate available on the open market should be taxable, because it is clearly a benefit. But when a benefit is not being received and the difference is not with the going rate but with the artificial benchmark rate set by the Government, the benefit is of a different order. People should not pay tax on an artificial calculation of their benefit; they should pay tax on the real value of the benefit. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield seeks to achieve that. The Economic Secretary has said nothing to counter any points made by the hon. Gentleman or by my hon. Friends. I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will press the Economic Secretary further on this issue, because he has not given the Committee a satisfactory response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The new clause could significantly improve the ability of sport's governing bodies to develop and to promote their activities. It would allow the national, voluntary, non-profit distributing governing bodies to retain a much greater share of their earnings than is

currently possible. Incredible as it may seem the Inland Revenue treats the governing bodies of amateur sport as commercial companies. Our voluntary sports associations at national level are hindered, not helped, by that taxation policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 52 would relieve the voluntary national sports associations of corporation tax. Not a great deal of money is involved. The figure is probably much less than £10 million. The amount in the last year for which figures are available was approximately £6 million. The proposal is very modest when set against the sum that the Exchequer already takes from sport, which is over £2 billion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope that the new clause will be accepted so that similar provisions for Scotland can be considered. The new clause refers only to England and Wales because of some technicalities. I am sure that the hon.

The attitude of many local authorities in Scotland towards sport is more generous than that of their English and Welsh counterparts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfair that groups of sports enthusiasts that accept onerous duties, including the organisation and promotion of sport, should be penalised for any financial success that they enjoy. National governing bodies do not distribute profits through dividends or bonuses to individuals; they try to create a surplus for reinvestment, which is used to promote the sport for which they are responsible. For example, the Amateur Swimming Association repaid £7,500 this year. That is a small sum, but the money could have been spent in ensuring that people throughout the country benefited from live-saving swimming skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause does not seek to give tax relief to individual clubs or associations, or private profit-making sports clubs. Private clubs are entitled to make a profit, but the new clause would not extend tax relief, to them. Individuals who use sport to secure personal income should not be exempt from paying tax. The new clause has been carefully drafted to exclude from corporation tax relief any organisation that uses sport simply to make a profit. All forms of professional sport would be excluded. A voluntary body would need to meet two criteria to qualify for relief under the new clause: its purpose must be to encourage, develop and govern sport and other forms or recreational activity; it would need articles of association that precluded the direct or indirect payment or transfer of any of its income or property to any of its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who would benefit from the new clauses? About 100 associations are members of the Central Council of Physical Recreation. They would not receive a huge windfall—some would receive as little as £750 a year. However, that would be a huge boost to the morale of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
those who work hard for their sport and ensure that more and more people participate in it.

Britain is one of the western European countries that taxes sport most heavily. We are top of the sports taxation league and we consistently fail to recognise the general contribution of sport in the United Kingdom. Many financial problems face sport, including the crippling effects of the uniform business rate on local sports clubs, VAT on sports club members, and the uncertainties of the real costs of compulsory competitive tendering. There are many other problems that cannot be solved tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there should be a financial review of the way that sport is taxed and how it is granted. Will the Financial Secretary give some commitment about that? For far too long we have taken a piecemeal approach to the taxation and granting of sport.

When the Finance Bill was going through the House two years ago, this very same proposal was debated on the Floor of the House and had all-party support. All former Ministers with responsibility for sport supported the measure. That is something about those former Minister—once they give up the job, they start doing things for sport. I am not sure about the position of the current Minister. Accepting the new clause would give a little hope to our sporting governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said then that he would review the issues in the proposals and discuss them with right hon. and hon. Members and members of the governing bodies. I should like the Minister to give a commitment tonight that he will review the way that sport is taxed.

A Treasury Minister may not be in the best position to judge, but nor is it a task that could be readily performed by the Charity Commissioners in England and Wales.

The Government receive many requests from a variety of bodies each year for exemption from tax. Most of those bodies can plead that they are a deserving cause. The tax system is not a good way of judging the merits of such causes. The only bodies that enjoy outright exemption are local authorities and health service bodies. This is for administrative reasons to save much work for those bodies and for the Inland Revenue.

If we accepted new clause 52 on a fairly narrow basis, the cost—including the effect of relief for company donations—could be between £10 million and £20 million.

Lady envisages, would be very expensive. It is difficult for the Inland Revenue to put a cost on that, but it envisages that that could be easily as much as £50 million, and possibly more. In light of the arguments that I have advanced and the significant cost that the new clause would bring, I hope that the hon. Lady will not press her new clause. If she were to do so, I assume that the Opposition would commit themselves to spending such a sum on those activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One problem is that no one studies the detail, which is why I am calling for a proper investigation of what we spend on sport, and on tax in relation to it. In view of the all-party support in the House for the measure, which leads me to hope that we shall discuss the matter in future, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
