	<section>
	<div class='title'>SOLICITING FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSTITUTION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 7, at beginning insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) In subsection (1) of section 1 (offence of soliciting a woman or different women for the purpose of prostitution from a motor vehicle, persistently or so as to cause annoyance or nuisance), for the words "man" and "woman" in the first place where each occurs, there shall be substituted the word "person".".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 7, leave out from "1" to "the" in line 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would introduce flexibility into the legislation. We support the thrust of the clause, but want it to state that a "person" commits an offence when soliciting a "person" for "the purpose of prostitution". I hope that hon. Members have copies of the Sexual Offences Act 1985, otherwise the argument will be tricky to follow. I notice that the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Summerson) does not have a copy. That Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A man commits an offence if he solicits a woman (or different women) for the purpose of prostitution."</p></blockquote>
We are convinced that the Committee will support this serious, unisex amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the changing recognition of the age of consent for homosexual and lesbian behaviour. Although the Minister will refute this, there are strong pressures to lower the age of consent in line with the age of consent for heterosexuals. I have reservations about that, but pressure groups argue that homosexuals and lesbians can have the same love relationships that heterosexuals have. Although it will take time, liberalisation is inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Libertarians and others believe that in a free society people should have the opportunity to choose their relationships. Current sterotypes are changing. I am a greate believer in marriage; I dislike the recent trend of the break-up of family life. I am not in favour of loose relationships or people living together before marriage. I am rather old-fashioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. John Patten)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be deselected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been reselected with 83 per cent support. The Minister is a little out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behaviour is changing, especially on the west coast of the United States. The liberalisation of relationships has a negative side and could result in male prostitution. We all welcomed the action of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Dame J. Fookes) in getting me Sexual Offences Act 1985 on to the statute book, but despite it prostitution, other than conventional prostitution where men solicit women, exists. My amendment would deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Jill Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Edgbaston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) on his reselection. If he is arguing that male prostitution exists, we should agree with him, but if he is arguing for lowering the age of consent, that is another matter and he would find it difficult to carry the Committee with him. The original rules on the age of consent were introduced to protect children and they will not be easily ditched. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will leave aside the question of lowering the age of consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention. You would rule me out of order, Mr. Knox, if I advocated changes in the age of consent. We should take note of the American experience because those trends are bound to rub off on British society. We must be careful in formulating this legislation because it provides an opportunity to prevent what has happened on the west coast of America from happening here. Police must have power to stop the abuse that has caused the hon. Member for Streatham (Sir W. Shelton) to promote the Bill. My amendment would add flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lancaster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the regrettable trends in the United States is the vast increase in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which has much to do with sexual behaviour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed a little flexibility, but the debate is now becoming out of order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not follow up the intervention, but will return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, I shall adhere to the Chairman's ruling. I shall not pursue the hon. Lady's argument that AIDS is a by-product of loose sexual behaviour, although I do not dispute what she says. There are libertarian trends. There were libertarian trends in the Victorian era when women were expected to stay at home and carry on with their embroidery until a man invited them to develop a relationship. They were stuck if that did not happen. Nowadays, thank goodness, women can invite men out. The amendments would make the Bill more flexible and would recognise some of the trends that are taking place.

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Regardless of the timing and extent of the proposed changes, the hon. Member for Streatham should support the amendment. It does not detract from his original intention; the amendment sensibly adds to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugo Summerson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Walthamstow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the libertarian trends to which he referred are intrinsically good?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to comment on that. I find many of those trends unacceptable. As I said, I am a little old-fashioned in such respects. I believe in family values, but that is beside the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's fondness for those values appears to be well disguised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I should comment on the hon. Lady's rather abusive remark. That is not the issue and I reject what she said. It is offensive and I ask her to withdraw it. I shall leave that to her, but if she is an honourable person, she will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The discussion is getting out of control. All Committee Members are honourable, although I think that the hon. Member for Lancaster (Dame E. Kellett-Bowman) might consider withdrawing her remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the hon. Gentleman was disguising his fondness for family values, not by his personal behaviour, but by the argument that he has been propounding today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady must not pursue a matter that has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Toby Jessel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the real point that the amendment appears to go along with the trends that the hon. Gentleman says that he deplores? In tabling the amendment, he is being inconsistent with his own beliefs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dismiss that logic, although I welcome the hon. Gentleman's intervention. It is beside the point whether I deplore such trends. The trends are real, as is evident from what is happening in the United States. The police and the courts should be able to act to protect residents in communities affected by unacceptable behaviour that causes both annoyance and nuisance. I do not want to argue the ethical points and you, Mr. Knox, would rule me out of order if I tried. I am merely pointing out what is happening. It is for the courts to decide what action should be taken on such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Beaumont-Dark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Selly Oak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all trying to follow the remarks of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall), but I am at a loss when he says that it is beside the point whether hon. Members in the High Court of Parliament approve of the measures before them. Hon. Members are here to make laws and to define what distinguishes good behaviour from bad. Many of us think that the belief that "anything goes" in society is dangerous. The hon. Gentleman cited the west coast of America. If he believes that everything from the west coast of America is good because of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
so-called libertarian society, he loses my sympathy. If society was so good, we should not be considering this excellent Bill today. The High Court interprets law made by Parliament. Parliament must set standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that issue should have been raised on Second Reading. I am constrained by these narrow amendments. I should be happy to speak about ethical values—at the weekend I intend to make a speech about that in Leeds—and to argue about the rights and wrongs of prostitution, but you would jump on me like a ton of bricks, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a narrow amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comment. The amendment attempts to enhance the Bill by providing flexibility. Amendment No. 2 is consequential and seeks to remove part of the clause. I hope that the hon. Member for Streatham and other members of the Committee will support that reasoned, sensible amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir William Shelton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Streatham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.1 am pleased that they were tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and two Lambeth colleagues, the hon. Members for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) and for Vauxhall (Miss Hoey). Many of the problems tackled by the Bill are encountered in Lambeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely understand the point of the amendments and I sympathise with some of what was said by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West. At first glance, it seems right to enlarge the scope of the Bill to include those men who from a car solicit youths walking along the pavement or prostitutes who cruise in their cars and solicit men. To my knowledge, that has not happened in Streatham, but it might. Legislation should exist to apprehend and bring those people to trial. However, the changes are unnecessary because those matters are covered by existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of a woman soliciting from a car, section 1 of the Street Offences Act 1959 makes it an offence to
	<br><blockquote><p>"loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution."</p></blockquote>
A kerb-crawling prostitute would, therefore, be liable to be stopped, questioned and prosecuted. A prostitute does not have to solicit persistently on foot or in a car to be prosecuted. That point is well covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 32 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 deals with soliciting by males for homosexual purposes. A male soliciting in a car or on foot faces a maximum of two years' imprisonment on indictment, or on summary conviction up to six months' imprisonment and/or a maximum fine of £2,000. Those offences, rightly, already appear on the statue book. Homosexual soliciting attacts a substantial penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes to increase the maximum penalty for kerb crawling from £400 to £1,000. The average penalty is about £100. With a bit of luck, if the maximum is raised, the average will rise to £300 or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
£400. The Bill proposes that the maximum penalty for kerb crawling should be £1,000, but the maximum penalty for homosexual kerb crawling is already a custodial sentence and a £2,000 fine. Therefore, an insuperable difficulty arises unless another amendment is tabled to change the maximum penalty for kerb crawling, which would probably mean returning to the Criminal Law Revision Committee for its views and opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary because the relevant legislation already exists. It would also make nonsense of the maximum penalty of £1,000 in the Bill, in the light of the maximum penalty of £2,000 and custodial sentence mat already exist. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this point because it has given us the opportunity to remind potential lady kerb crawlers or homosexual kerb crawlers that far greater penalties, than we suggest in the Bill, already exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. Member for Streatham (Sir W. Shelton) about existing powers. My hon. Friends and I have been persuaded by his arguments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 9, leave out "(or different women) and".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 4, in page 1, line 10, leave out "persistently" and insert "or".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 3, in page 1, line 16, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"() at end of section 1 there shall be added—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) A person prosecuted for such an offence shall not be liable to be convicted solely on the evidence of one witness that, in the opinion of the witness, the person was soliciting for the purpose of prostitution unless the evidence of that one witness shows that the soliciting was persistent or likely to cause annoyance to the person solicited, or nuisuance to other persons in the neighbourhood."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The offence of kerb crawling in the 1985 Act can be tried only summarily. People accused of kerb crawling can be tried only by magistrates and cannot no matter how great the potential damage to their reputation or living, put their case before a jury as they would with an offence of dishonesty. It is important to bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall illustrate my argument with two cases—one real and the other hypothetical. The first involves a judge who was one of the first people to be convicted under the Sexual Offences Act 1985. He went before the magistrates and was convicted of persistently soliciting prostitutes in the west end. He was probably a good judge. He went to appeal and his case was reheard in the Crown court. However, rehearing appeals in magistrates courts does not involve a jury. Appeals are usually heard by a Crown court judge sitting with two justices. The judge's reputation would have been irreparably damaged by a conviction for

persistent importuning of prostitutes. He was found, on appeal, to be not guilty of the offence. I hope that that example illustrates the high risks to a person's reputation when he faces such charges as soliciting prostitutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also not forget that even when appeals are granted, they are not always successful. We know that in the case of the Guildford Four. Their case went to the Court of Appeal but was unsuccessful. There may be a risk of encountering a judge like the one described by W.S. Gilbert in "Trial by Jury":
	<br><blockquote><p>"Though all my law is fudge,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Yet I'll never, never budge,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But I'll live and die a judge."</p></blockquote>
It is a big problem if a person charged with an offence encounters such a judge when appealing against conviction. That is unknown, even in very serious cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to my hypothetical example. Let us consider the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, which states that in cases of speeding the opinion of one police officer or witness alone is insufficient for conviction. There must be corroboration from a second police officer or witness, or a reading from a measured speedometer. Because the Bill removes the word "persistently" or the need to prove any nuisance or annoyance, it risks making the weight of evidence necessary too light. Conviction should not take place without corroboration unless there is persistence or nuisance and annoyance. The amendment leaves existing law entirely undisturbed. It would require corroboration only because of the risk to a person's reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hypothetical case involves the hon. Member for Streatham (Sir W. Shelton) facing difficulties in the next general election. He finds that proposals for the south circular road and the poll tax make his electoral chances slim. He pleads with Conservative central office for help and receives the support and assistance of his hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Beaumont-Dark), for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel) and for Luton, South (Mr. Bright). 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Roads in south London have been partly closed by Lambeth council. Hampton court maze is a doddle compared with some of our back streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine that the hon. Member for Luton, South finds himself cruising round the back streets searching for the roads where he is supposed to canvass electoral support. He is looking for Ockley Road, but cannot find it. He looks for somebody to ask directions, but can see only an attractive lady on the corner of the street who is beckoning towards him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

tells the policeman that what has happened is outrageous. The arresting officer responds to his story by saying, "That's the best one I've heard yet. You had better tell it to the beak." The hon. Member for Luton, South, or perhaps the hon. Member for Selly Oak, faces the possibility of a conviction for soliciting a prostitute. That is grave for his reputation, especially during a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began jocularly, but this is a serious issue. The Bill lowers the standard of proof needed for a conviction by omitting the words "persistent" and "nuisance". That should be counterbalanced by a necessity for corroborating evidence to protect an accused person's reputation in a summary trial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is a considerable difference between approaching a lady who is beckoning and the ladies that we are discussing. We have such ladies in Luton and they are usually dressed in such a way as to be easily recognised. As I have been warned by various people, including my mother, about such things, I would not be so foolish as to stop my car to approach such a lady. If I approach a person and immediately ask the whereabouts of a road for which I am looking, it is obvious that I am not soliciting. The hon. Gentleman's point does not stand up. If I were cruising round looking for a road, I would be a fool to stop and ask that sort of woman who is easily recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. When I was practising in the magistrates courts, I represented prostitutes who worked in the part of Streatham that we are discussing. Police often gave evidence that accused persons looked like prostitutes because they were not wearing stockings. I should think that nowadays, wearing stockings is more a sign of prostitution than not wearing them. There are cases of people who look perfectly respectable, but have a host of convictions as common prostitutes. To categorise a woman as a prostitute by her appearance is wrong. There may be people more innocent than the hon. Member for Luton, South, such as the hon. Member for Selly Oak, whose innocence could convict them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Therefore, I shall support the amendment, but I shall vote against the Bill both here and when it returns to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) said, the law relating to prostitution is already suurrounded by a considerable amount of wrongful harassment of women by the police and corruption of the police because of their involvement. The major study of prostitution carried out in the King's Cross area in the early 1980s revealed much of that. I hope that the amendment will be accepted, although I suspect that it will not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that we are placing into the hands of the police yet further powers without proper or adequate checks. They will inevitably be abused, individuals' careers will be damaged, often irreparably, and a whole new range of instances of harassment will take place on the street. There is little or nothing in the Bill that will do other than worsen that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be considering a different approach. We should see the same enthusiasm from Conservative Members for tackling and removing the causes as they have for constantly increasing police powers and controls in society. The causes lie in the nature of sexism in our society, the exploitation of women and the way in which both men and women are conditioned into roles from which many are not free to break out. The hilarity on Conservative Benches during this discussion merely reinforces my view that the attitude that goes right across society is shared by Conservative Members. We are not dealing with a problem that will go away or be resolved simply by increasing police powers or by a police presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past 30 or 40 years the problem has moved round London. There is a concentration of prostitution in one area, public pressure builds up and the police response is to move the problem away from that area, so it simply moves somewhere else. There is a cycle. The problem goes round London from King's Cross down to Streatham and sometimes to Shepherd market. After a time, the police presence decreases and prostitution picks up again. The problem is being pursued round London; it is not being resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in prostitution at the beginning of the 1980s was clearly identified by the social and economic forces that created it. In the King's Cross study, the long-time prostitutes made it clear that the increase in prostitution in the area was due to what they referred to as Thatcher's women—women who had turned to prostitution because of the increase in unemployment.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I know that it is wrong to call this rank hypocrisy, but it calls into question the judgment of Conservative Members, who have done everything possible to increase the social conditions in which prostitution grows, that they are now trying to find new ways of controlling the problem. They have contributed to it by supporting the economic policies of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beaumont-Dark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put aside the nonsense about women being driven to prostitution because of a particular Government, mere seems to be a tremendous foregetfulness that prostitution, next to politics, is the oldest profession in the world. I am not certian which does more harm. I should like to bring home to the hon. Gentleman the situation that we face in parts of Birmingham. In the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame J. Knight) and mine there are areas such as Balsall heath and Moseley where cars contiinually crawl up and down roads where extraordinarily respectable people live. It casues grave offence to have one's womenfolk approached. Even women with prams have been approached from cars and if they say, "buzz off, the cars hurtle off. The Bill aims to stop that—as did the previous Bill. We supported that Bill and served on the Committee that considered it. If the hon. Gentleman is really saying that a change of Government will bring an end to prostitution he lives in the oddest of worlds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livingstone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman confirms my point. He served on the Committee that considered the earlier Bill to tackle the problem and he is now on this Committee because it has not worked. When this Bill does not work what will the next measure be? Is it not time to examine the social causes? I agree that kerb crawling is deeply offensive. It is appalling for people who are subjected to it. However, earlier measures have not stopped it. Massive police operations in London have not stopped it. The problem has just been moved elsewhere. I suspect that that is true in Birmingham and other cities. Rather than waste the time of the House and the Committee we should examine the social causes and remove them. There definitely was an increase in prostitution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
support the thrust of the Bill just as in 1985 I supported the thrust of the Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Dame J. Fookes). It was only because a Lords amendment inserted the word "persistently" that we have not been able to deal with the problem effectively. Like the hon. Gentleman, I believe that social causes should also be tackled, but that does not mean that the law cannot be used as well to circumvent behaviour that is unacceptable. As the hon. Gentleman conceded, constant trails of cars molesting women and children is the exploitation of women. The issues are not divisible. I should not like the Bill to be watered down so that the police are prevented from taking effective action in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one course of action that some police forces have been taking and which the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) mentioned on Second Reading. Before court proceedings a letter is often sent by the local constabulary to the driver of a car that is regularly seen in an area. The hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) gave a hard case and we all know that hard cases make bad laws, but when he moved from the jocular to the serious he was on to a point. There are times when police powers can be abused. There are times when bogus cases can be constructed and people can be framed. We are all aware of that, but no hon. Member believes that that is how the police regularly behave. The canvassing case that the hon. Member gave earlier is not one that is likely to come before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly it is unsatisfactory if someone regularly goes to an area and stops women collecting their children from school or coming home, or if residents have to stay up half the night noting the numbers of cars to prove that someone has persistently been in the area. The law must be changed and it is right to have the Bill. The hon. Member for Streatham (Sir William Shelton) has done the House a service by returning to the matter. The hon. Member for Brent, East says that he will vote for the amendment because it will lessen the effectiveness of the Bill; I cannot support it for the same reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. John Patten)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing a serious issue and our debate has been conducted seriously.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good to be sitting under your eagle eye again, Mr. Knox, and it is good to see the Committee so very well attended because the Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Sir W. Shelton) has attracted much attention. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) is here. He is a glutton for punishment. His private Member's Bill on acid house parties is going through the House and he has a major problem of prostitution in his constituency, as many other hon. Members have in theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was good to hear the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) move the amendment so forcefully as I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
know how much he cares about justice. I have sat with him on many Committees dealing with criminal justice measures and know that he cares about the individual and individual freedoms. He also cares about opera and his speeches are always marked with references to it. This morning he mentioned Gilbert and Sullivan. During our discussions on the Criminal Justice Act 1988, references to Donizetti often fell from his lips. He talked of "Lucia di Lammermoor" and, happily, the Library gave us the name of "Emilia di Liverpool", which has never been performed. Perhaps the hon. Member for Liverpool, Mossley Hill and I can persuade the Arts Council to consider organising a performance of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constituency of the hon. Member for Norwood suffers from these problems, but perhaps not as much as that of the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Cox), whom I am glad to see in the Committee. The amendment was predicted on a reference to road traffic legislation. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but fear that it might be confusing to relate that to the 1985 Act, which was introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Drake (Dame J. Fookes). We are all pleased that she is on this Committee. Road traffic legislation provides that the evidence of one police witness is sufficient, but only if corroborated by the reading of a speedometer. In that way the evidence is of fact, not of opinion. I do not know how that precedent could be applied to the Bill. A whole string of amendments and creative thinking about measuring instruments that were comparable to speedometers would be needed and that would create difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) said, residents of many areas have problems with the local effects of kerb crawling. In 1988—the last year for which I have full and up-to-date evidence—there were only 578 convictions under the excellent Act of my hon. Friend for Plymouth, Drake. That does not reflect the scale of the nuisance. It is a nuisance in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs), who has often expressed those views to the Home Office. We need this legislation. We should resist the amendment of the hon. Member for Norwood because no legislative device would ever stop someone being brought to trial when the prosecuting authorities have made a genuine mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest and some amustment to the hypothetical canvassing example given by the hon. Gentleman. More realistically, let us suppose that someone driving from the north, en route to Dover, intended to stay overnight with a great aunt in Streatham, but got lost and stopped at 2 a.m. to ask the way from one of those young ladies, however she was dressed—prostitutes dress to make them look like prostitutes or like ordinary women, so one cannot always tell from their dress. A policeman could, inadvisedly, think that that man was soliciting. It would be simple for the man to prove that he was on his way to his aunt and was seeking the correct number of the street in Streatham. There could occasionally be a few cases of mistaken identity, but the Bill seeks to ensure that such mistakes do not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
It is a serious issue if a man or woman's freedom or reputation hangs on the evidence of one person in a court of law, and we should take the point made by the hon. Member for Norwood seriously. However, he will recall that the Criminal Justice Act 1988 made it possible, for example, for a child to give uncorroborated evidence in a court of law. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not saying that it would be proper for a child's uncorroborated evidence to be heard in a court of law, but not that of a policeman, or policewoman. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise the issue for debate, following his concern for the individual and individual reputations, but when he hears the points that I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham will make, I hope that he will feel it beneficial to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kate Hoey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vauxhall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Bill and the amendment. To answer the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), a visit to the constituency of the hon. Member for Streatham (Sir W. Shelton) and other parts of the borough would show that the police cannot use the existing legislation as it was meant to be used or prosecute the most persistent offenders. That is the result of the word "persistently".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to add my name to the amendment in order to stimulate this discussion. It is important probe ways to ensure that individuals are safeguarded and arbitrary action by individual police officers cannot ruin someone's life and public image through wrongful accusation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is an attempt to hammer hard the people who persistently drive round areas intent on disrupting the neighbourhood and upsetting the people who live there. I am glad that you stopped the debate at the beginning, Mr. Knox, as it is not about morals, ethics and the question of prostitution. It is simply about how we stop women being plagued while walking home or collecting their children from school. Harassment is not only at night but during the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when we have heard from the hon. Member for Streatham we shall not feel it necessary to press the amendment, as it will not help the police. They have used an enormous number of officers in that and other areas to try to prevent this nuisance. They are restricted by the word "persistently" and are having to use resources that, in a borough such as Lambeth, could be put to better use. I do not want to see police time wasted, as it will be without the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested to hear the views of the hon. Member for Streatham about striking a balance between making sure that we convict the guilty while not staining the reputation of the innocent. If he can satisfy me on that, I should be happy for the amendment to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Janet Fookes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot support the amendments because they undermine the purpose of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Liverpool, Mossley Hill (Mr. Alton) correctly pointed out, the other place undermined the purpose of the 1985 Bill by insisting on the introduction of the word "persistently". That was not my wish, but as I was faced with the possibility of losing the Bill, I chose the lesser of two evils. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Sir. W. Shelton) has sought to bring back the original intention in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ask for "persistently" to be part of the proof, places an intolerable burden on those seeking to find that proof. Moreover, if the offence is required to be a nuisance, those to whom it is a nuisance will have to say so in court. Any woman living in an area where the offence occurs will have good reasons for not being anxious to testify. Unfortunately, kerb crawling is often accompanied by quarrels, fights, general unpleasantness and swearing because minders, or whatever name they go by, are also in the area. A peripheral criminal element exists around this nuisance. It is unreasonable to expect any woman, or even a man, living in an area where kerb crawling occurs, to give evidence. We still have the safeguards of the normal evidence that is required for a conviction in court. That is acceptable. I cannot support the amendments, but warmly support the general thrust of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly. Most hon. Members who took part in the Second Reading debate believe that we must grapple with a serious problem. We must protect the interests of the community and at the same time increase penalties and reduce the evidential requirements for a conviction. I support the notion of making it easier to obtain convictions because communities have been seriously affected by kerb crawling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1985 Act of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Dame J. Fookes) has been stifled because the conditions of evidence, nuisance and persistence are so stringent that it has not been used as often as it should have been. I support the notion of making convictions simple, but, as I said on Second Reading, it is our duty as legislators to ensure that we protect innocent people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment shows that we support the notion of reducing evidential requirements. We shall wipe out "persistently", "annoyance" and "nuisance", but on condition that the evidence from a witness is corroborated. That is not unreasonable. If we cannot obtain corroboration, the conditions of the 1985 Act should stand. That means that we can both provide stronger measures to reduce kerb crawling and other obscene behaviour that have had an impact on communities, and make convictions safer, which, as legislators, we have a duty to do. It is eminently sensible to adopt the approach in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the House of Lords debated the sexual offences legislation in 1985 it decided that the safety of convictions raised a problem. That is why it inserted the stringent evidential requirements, although I think that it went too far. We must achieve a balance. We must reduce the evidential requirements so that convictions can be achieved more easily while increasing the corroborative requirements to ensure that convictions are safe. If we cannot do that, we must adhere to the original requirements on evidence. That would ensure safe convictions and enable the police
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
and the Crown prosecution service to take action to eradicate an enormous social problem. Amendment No. 5 is worth supporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 4 and 3 are probing amendments. Amendment No. 4 would have the effect of retaining the word "persistently" in the Sexual Offences Act 1985 while omitting the other two requirements of causing nuisance or annoyance. That is a sensible relaxation of the evidential requirements if the Bill does not provide for corroboration—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jessel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. I am in the middle of a sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Minister and the hon. Member for Streatham considered the possibility of partially changing the evidential requirements by leaving in "persistently' and taking out "annoyance" and "nuisance"? It is easy to determine whether behaviour is persistent. For example, if a person drove around in a car and wound down a window to solicit women, it would not be difficult to get evidence to prove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House of Lords put into the 1985 Act the words "persistently" and "different women". An offender has to solicit different women to be prosecuted. Will the Minister and the hon. Member for Streatham comment on that? Is there a half-way house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jessel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crucial point is the word "persistently". Other criminal offences could affect a person's reputation even more, but perpetrators do not have to commit those crimes persistently to be convicted. A murderer, rapist or burglar has only to commit one crime to be prosecuted. That should also apply to this crime. In the case of all offences that could affect a person's reputation, the court must be satisfied of the defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, otherwise he must be acquitted. Why should this offence be different?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I argued on Second Reading, we hope to try to maintain a balance between being able to convict an offender more easily than under the 1985 Act and taking stock of the House of Lords view that the Act could lead to unsafe convictions. Is it possible to get to grips with that to secure more convictions for kerb crawling and prostitution and also to ensure safe convictions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great merit in amendment No. 3, and I hope that the Committee will suppport it, because it would make inroads into the unacceptable behaviour of kerb crawling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we debated that matter earlier, it was suggested tht I might approach a lady who beckoned to me to ask the way. If a woman who stood on a street corner beckoned to me, she would associate herself with the oldest profession in the world. That instance described how matters could go wrong, but that is not the point. I have watched soliciting from a distance in my constituency and I have accompanied the police to observe the difficulty that they experience under present legislation, which puts the onus on them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
to prove that someone has been kerb crawling persistently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) said that it was easy to identify someone who was cruising, winding a window down and talking to women, but it is not easy for the police to bring a prosecution. They can identify those people from afar, but there must be proof of soliciting. Clearly, a professional girl will not be a police witness, but ordinary women or girls who are accosted while walking home will also be reluctant to give evidence. It is not only a matter of the nuisance that is caused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem in my constituency has been so great that the borough council has erected two gates to close off certain roads from the circuit of kerb crawlers. That has merely made the circle wider, but it is easy to identify a kerb crawler who approaches a woman. He does not ask for directions to a certain street. He asks, openly, whether the woman is available and how much she charges. Very often, he will become aggressive when a woman asserts that she is an innocent bystander, believing that any woman who walks that circuit must be in business. Such behaviour obviously causes much distress to innocent women.

In my area, a police unit, consisting of three policemen and one policewoman under the leadership of an inspector, has done a wonderful job. The policewoman is extremely brave and has acted as a decoy. I can see no reason why a man who approaches her and asks whether she is available should not be run in for kerb crawling. Nor is there any need to wait for him to go round the circuit a second time before an arrest is made. The police have lists of car numbers and know the vehicles that appear on the circuit. The task is to catch the men talking to women so that an arrest can be made. It has been suggested the police could send letters to suspected kerb crawlers. That has been done, and police officers have even called on people's homes to warn persistent crawlers of the circuit that they could find themselves in trouble. That has caused some families much anguish, and it could be claimed that that anguish might also be suffered by innocent people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about the letters emerged on Second Reading. The police have sent letters to the wives of men whom they suspected of kerb crawling. That is a dangerous practice which I totally condemn. The men have not been convicted of anything, and in the eyes of the law they are innocent. The wreckage of a marriage has immense consequences, and should not be risked in the absence of a conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I was making. The police's sheer frustration at the problem of attempting to catch kerb crawlers and to push them away from certain areas has forced them to resort to such tactics. The Bill's proposals to facilitate die arrest of a kerb crawler as soon as it is clear mat a proposition has been made to a woman—especially if the woman were a policewoman acting as a decoy—would enable the police to get to grips with the problem. That would put an end to watching the cars go round the circuit, which the hon. Gentleman has already described. I, too, have kept watch with residents. I have seen the same car
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
appear on the circuit on three separate nights. The driver's intentions were obvious, but the police could do no more than send a letter and call on his home. That was equally daring, because the driver had only been touring around. Had the police had the power to take him in on the first occasion that he approached a woman, it would have avoided the necessity for this cat and mouse game, which makes a tremendous demand on police resources and is the cause of innocent people being picked up for driving slowly around a particular circuit. We must support the Bill as it stands because it allows the police to take people in on the first occasion that they solicit, rather than having to wait for further attempts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Cox 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tooting)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to many of the speeches. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Dame J. Fookes) will recall that I served on that Committee five years ago. I support the Bill that was introduced by the hon. Member for Streatham (Sir W. Shelton). Our constituencies adjoin and the problem has plagued our areas for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone). All hon. Members are interested in the rights of individuals, but I am equally interested in the rights of women. The hon. Member for Streatham will agree that those people who drive around our area are not constituents but have come for one purpose. The police should have the right to take action against them. I have had hundreds of cases of women of all ages who have been consistently abused by people who regard them as prostitutes. That should not be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright). The police should not be encouraged to use decoys. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East is relevant to that sort of police action. During a debate on criminal justice legislation, I discussed the arrest of men charged with importuning. It is well-known mat an hon. Member went to a club without intending to pick up other men, but police officers in that club were dressed in a manner to encourage people to take action for which they could be arrested. That hon. Member, whose name I shall not mention, was unfortunate. I must tell the hon. Member for Luton, South that I oppose such action. Police have a difficult job and must decide how to police an area. The Home Office should not encourage the police to use decoys. Hon. Members who represent areas where prostitution is a problem know that there is ample evidence on the streets without that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making was that the police were driven to such action to gather evidence. If the Bill is passed as it stands, it will be easy to bring a prosecution on the evidence of a woman who is solicited by a man in a car. At present, a cat and mouse game has to take place, which is the existing legislation's weakness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I do not intend to speak for long, because the Bill should be warmly supported by all hon. Members.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
We know from the Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Dame Janet Fookes) that there were loopholes. As the hon. Gentleman has confirmed, the legislation did not give the police the powers necessary to take action. Therefore, I shall not be supporting amendment No. 3. It is a potential loophole and will not help the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, some hon. Ladies on the Committee may have experienced such incidents. As with obscene phone calls, women need not experience dozens to feel terribly upset and degraded. We must protect women who are walking along the street, going home, going shopping or meeting their children from being accosted and regarded as prostitutes. Therefore, I support the Bill, and, regrettably, shall not support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dame Jill Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very interesting that so many members of the Committee, who have not been selected for their specific knowledge of such matters, have spoken of the grief, worry and trouble that the wretched business of prostitution causes their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police have a difficult job in protecting us. The hon. member for Tooting (Mr. Cox) has said that he cannot accept the proposed method of catching men who are a menace to women, but I can. Policemen and policewomen will be protecting women in finding potential menaces. How else can we be sure that all the necessary protection is provided?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her notable and important effort in 1985, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Drake (Dame Janet Fookes) introduced a Bill to deal with this problem. It is interesting how many members of this Committee also served on that Committee. There was great pleasure and relief when the Bill was introduced because it was thought that women under threat would be protected. For the reasons which my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Drake has given, the Bill was not effective. It would be a tragedy if, given a second bit of the cherry, we failed again to give protection to the people who need it so badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall vote not for the amendment but for the Bill as it stands. I hope that we will at last give innocent women, who fear to walk the streets because of the way that they are often made to feel degraded, the protection that they so richly deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear that I intend to withdraw amendment No. 5, but wish to speak to amendment No. 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel) asked why corroboration should be necessary in this matter when it is not necessary for cases of murder, rape and burglary. The difference is that in burglary or murder cases there is a victim and damage or injury take place. In the offence created by the Bill, there is seldom a victim because no nuisance or persistence must be proved. By definition, the Bill is creating an offence where there is no vitim. It is also creating an offence where there is no damage or injury. It is an inchoate offence and, as such, it differs from others. We need to be especially careful to ensure that people
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
are not wrongly convicted on the evidence of one witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was wrong in the examples that he gave relating to the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, which does not say that the opinion of the police officer has to be corroborated by a speedometer—it may be, but it does not have to be. If two police officers have a joint opinion about speeding, that is sufficient corroboration. The opinion of one police officer is sufficient if corroborated by the factual evidence of a speedometer. I was drawing an analogy between the amendment and the ability of two police officers to give an opinion about speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inchoate offences in which there is no witness apart from a police officer demand caution. As the hon. Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright), said, a prostitute never wishes to give evidence; she is not annoyed but pleased that an approach has been made to her. I have represented Brixton and lived through the period of the sus law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am familiar with the situation in the previous century when Parliament sought to prevent Scotsmen from causing a nuisance in London. I have consulted 	<i>Hansard</i> and studied the debates. Parliament, in an excess of zeal, passed laws that led to many innocent people being convicted of offences. The passage of the Official Secrets Act 1911 is another example of how easily such potentially dangerous legislation can pass through Parliament. Edward Carson forced the measure through. Just a paragraph or so was enough. A Tory farmer said something like, "I think that there is something wrong with this Bill," and Carson said, "Forget it." It was not put to a vote, and the Official Secrets Act went through in an afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful when we are creating certain categories of offences that the balance of evidence is right. I see no practical difficulty whatever in the working of the amendment. Normally, two police officers work together, and their evidence would be sufficient to secure conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. members for Luton, South and for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame J. Knight) referred to a decoy. The correct phrase, if I can get my French right, is "provocateuse" as a woman is involved. Normally, as I said, two witnesses would be enough to bring the charge; but conviction on the uncorroborated evidence of one person's opinion must be seriously considered. The ingredients of the offence are that there has to be man soliciting a woman, which is relatively easy to prove. The purpose is the key element—for the purpose of prositution in this case. In inchoate offences that is a matter of opinion rather than fact. That is the difficulty that requires further evidence of corroboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the hon. Member for Streatham (Sir W. Shelton) and concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Cox) about the nuisance problems caused by these activities. I hope that the Committee will move forward quickly. I believe in sticking to our principles, and we have an obligation not to be panicked into too loose legislation that could damage people's reputations and lead to unfair convictions. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
suspect that most Committee Members may be against me. We must all make up our own minds about the amendment, and I shall understand if some of my hon. Friends disagree with me. However, I shall stick by my guns, because my amendment is upholding a principle of justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir William Shelton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me say how grateful I am for the many excellent and interesting contributions that have been made. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) for tabling the amendments, which have stimulated this debate, and to the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) for saying that there is no intention to press amendments Nos. 4 and 5. As we discussed the matter in depth on Second Reading, it might be for the convenience of the Committee if I do not reply to the points made on amendments Nos. 4 and 5. I think that we all understand the problem over-persistence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, I have a letter from Birmingham city council and another from the South Bayswater crime prevention panel, as samples of many letters I have received, saying how important it is mat the word "persistently" should be deleted from the 1985 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make a few remarks on the interesting issues raised by the hon. Member for Norwood on amendment No. 3. I understand and have some sympathy with the burden of what he is saying about the use of the word "persistently". I shall backtrack for a moment. There was some misunderstanding of the 1985 Act. Offenders could be arrested either for persistent abuse or for making a nuisance. Therefore, if we leave in the word "persistently" and take out the reference to nuisance, we would vitiate or weaken the ways in which to arrest an offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the 1985 Act provides two choices. An offender can be persistent or he can cause a nuisance. My understanding of the Act is that, if I were a policeman, I could go up to the hon. Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) and say, "You have been soliciting persistently, so come along." Alternatively, I can go up to him and say, "This lady says that you have been annoying her, not persistently but just once." Under the present Act—I shall not pursue the issue, as I am delighted that it will not be pressed—a kerb crawler can tell the policeman, "Yes, I am a kerb crawler, and, yes, I did solicit that lady but once. I did not cause her nuisance nor annoyance." The policeman would have to say, "Good evening, sir, on your way." To leave in the word "persistently" and remove the alternative would substantially weaken the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the difficulty with amendment No. 3. If we are saying that we need corroboration, it would have to be from another policeman. It is most unlikely that one would get corroboration from the prostitute or that a casual passerby would be prepared to come to court to corroborate the incident. Therefore, corroboration must be likely to come from a policeman. What we are saying is that policemen would have to go in pairs, or they would never be able not to make an arrest, as it is an indictable offence, but to issue a summons, as the individual policeman would
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
not have the corroboration of another policeman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, are we prepared to say that the offence of kerb crawling must always be witnessed by at least two policemen together—in the street, in the car, or wherever they happen to be—before a person can be summonsed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Minister referred to section 34 of the 1988 Act, which abolished the requirement of corroboration for the unsworn evidence of children of tender age. If the courts are prepared to accept the testimony of a child of, say, eight, would it not be rather hard of us to say that we did not accept the testimony of a policeman? One can say—I, for one, would not—that a policeman might wish to give false evidence, but it would not be impossible, as we have seen recently in one very difficult case, for two policemen to do the same. Therefore, I do not accept that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the judgment of two police officers is probably more reliable than the judgment of one police officer—the judgment of three is probably more reliable than the judgment of two—but I would not be happy to say that we were not prepared to accept the judgment of one police officer. Committee Members must remember that it is not the judgment of that police officer that convicts the offender. We have an independent prosecution service, and the police officer must convince it that his judgment was correct—of course, the kerb crawler will have his say. He will say, "No, I was not soliciting, I was doing something else." Even with two police officers I guess that he would say that. Few kerb crawlers would say, "Yes, I am guilty."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would be asking a lot from our hard-pressed police—we always want more of them on the streets— if we were to say to the chief superintendents of the various police forces throughout the country, "We do not trust the judgment of your policeman, therefore you must have policemen." It would be much more expensive, and the other police officer might be better employed doing other tasks rather than corroborating the evidence of his friendly neighbourhood police officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the purpose of the amendment, but I hope that it will not be pursued because I would find it difficult to insist that wherever kerb crawling took place a satisfactory summons could be issued only if there were two policemen standing side by side to corroborate each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman recalls the case that I quoted on Second Reading. A journalist went out in a police car to investigate kerb crawling. In the report, the police sergeant said that, in practice, people who are kerb crawling in cars must be pursued in a car, and there are usually two police officers in the car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir William Shelton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is probably right. According to my local police, there are usually two officers in a car. However, in Streatham, a single foot patrol patrols certain streets while another one patrols the streets somewhere else. Their numbers are unfortunately limited. Our vice squad has only six
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
foot patrols, whereas neighbouring Wandsworth has 12. That aggravates me, and I am attempting to do something about it. The six members of the vice squad also have other duties, and they are not permanently on duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not legislate that there should always be two police officers together in a car or on foot. I accept the point about road traffic. If a speedometer reads 100 mph, that is a matter of fact, not judgment. Vehicles are usually patrolled by two police officers, but no law stipulates that. I should prefer to leave the matter to the discretion of the chief superintendent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Summerson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment would weaken the Bill not only for established areas of prostitution, but for prospective arears?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir William Shelton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would make it more difficult to arrest a kerb crawler, if the presence of two police officers was required. There are cases where arrests are made by one police officer. I hope that the Bill will be supported unanimously. There will be a Third Reading and it will then be considered by the other place. It may return from there. I hope that the hon. Member for Norwood will withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jessel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two police officers could only corroborate each other's evidence about whether a car stopped and a conversation took place between the driver and a women standing on the pavement. One, two, or more police officers could not report the conversation itself. The presence of two policemen could not confirm whether the motorist had a plausible alibi. Two officers could not contribute any more than one to the claim that a motorist was going to address a political meeting or trying to find his way. That could be revealed by the defence in court, or the motorist could tell the police officer when stopped and questioned. It could be suggested that two witnesses were better than one if there was a dispute about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
identity of the car or the number plate, but that is a peripheral matter. Two witnesses are not necessary. Why is there any need to weaken the effectiveness of the Bill? What would two police officers corroborate, Mr. Knox?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
