	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This batch of amendments has provoked quite a lengthy debate, which is surprising in view of the Committee's virtual unanimity on the substance of the clause and on what the Government amendments seek to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to introduce new relief, in clause 69, for expenditure on restoring a waste disposal site, which would be available only to waste disposal operators who have obtained the necessary disposal or mangement licence and planning permission, for their disposal operations on a particular site. Relief only extends to payments made to comply with conditions in the licence or in the planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that relief will be available, for expenditure which meets those tests, after a disposal licence has ceased to be in force. Under present law, a licence may be surrendered at any time. Such licences may not necessarily be in force for the period afer the completion of the deposit of waste on the site. Some restoration expenditure may therefore be incurred after the licence has ceased to be in force. We do not want to deny relief for that sort of expenditure, and the amendments accordingly remove the requirement that relief would only be due for a payment made at a time when a licence was in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is only a transitional point because the new waste management licences introduced by the Environmental Protection Bill will no longer permit surrender on demand. So there will be no possibility of a licence being surrendered before all required restoration work has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief does not create any opportunity for tax avoidance. On the contrary, by limiting relief to expenditures in conformity with the licence, its scope is minimised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in agreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew). In his constituency and on Tyneside we have direct experience of many of the circumstances on which many of the operations referred to in the clause will hinge. We both realise—many other Committee Members may not—that possession of rights to a hole in the ground is one of the most valuable commodities on the property market. That is especially true near urban areas where holes in the ground are not in great supply and where waste disposal presents grave problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
Waste disposal planning arrangements in this country work on a county basis. It can be difficult to shift waste disposal across county boundaries. That gives rise to great anxiety. Increasingly, waste disposal authorities that possess a large number of quarrying areas are reluctant to issue planning permission and licences to allow waste to be imported to their county areas. Waste disposal authorities increasingly, regard waste disposal and managment as a problem that must be dealt with on a county basis. In counties such as Tyne and Wear and Cleveland, that resutls in holes in the ground becoming extremely valuable, and the greater the pressure on waste disposal authorites to find disposal sites in county areas, the more valuable the sites become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem that worries my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle and me is that our appreciation of these factors does not seem to be reflected in either the clause or, more especially, this group of amendments. The frame of mind that underpins both is that there is a vast problem of tempting people to run through hoops by the application of special tax reliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is already evident from the last remarks of the Minister, unhappily by silence and implication rather than by clear statement, that we are dealing with proposals to go much further than merely going back to the legal position before the case of Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Ltd., which was the subject of considerable debate when we dealt with the previous group of amendments. The Minister's speech on this group was not couched in terms of restoring a right to tax relief which had been lost, and it is plain that the clause would go considerably further than merely restoring a traditional or conventional right to tax relief which was lost when that case was decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there such a great need to offer this additional relief? It is clear that that is what it is; it is not a relief contained in the fiscal boundaries of the application and value of the tax relief that existed prior to the case of Rolfe 	<i>v.</i> Wimpey Waste Management Ltd. My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle and I are worried about two aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. I hesitate to interrupt the hon.

I therefore beg to move, that the Question be now put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. We should like to vote on all the amendments in the group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not intend to allow votes on all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. I do not believe that that is the correct procedure. I am not questioning you, Mr. Coleman, but the Opposition have cogent reasons for wishing to vote on the amendments. The Government have prohibited us from demonstrating those reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Opposition may have cogent reasons, but the amendments are selected for debate, not necessarily for voting upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. I would not dream of challenging your ruling— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not expect to be filibustered by Conservative Members when I address the Chair in a courteous manner. Is it possible, Mr. Coleman, for us to vote on amendments which have not been referred to in debate so far? There is an amendment which I suspect has been tabled in the interest of the Scottish Law Society. It is quite an important amendment which makes a small but intelligent point, but no one has mentioned it. I would like to vote on it, as, I am sure, would my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wished to raise a technical point relating to Government amendment No. 165, to which I had added my name. I think that my point would have been useful, but that debate was also curtailed by the Financial Secretary's bullishness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will reconsider your decision, Mr. Coleman, and allow us to vote, even if we cannot have a debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:We shall see how we get on.

	<li>where materials are purchased prior to a site ceasing to be used for the carrying out of waste disposal activities, and those materials can reasonably be regarded as purchased for the purpose of later restoring the site, and are in fact so used, such materials shall for the purposes of this section be regarded as having been purchased immediately before they are so used.".</li></ol></p></q></p>
	<p>No. 177, in page 57, line 11, at end insert—

	<p>Government amendment No. 241.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was absolutely deplorable of the Financial Secretary to guillotine the last debate when Opposition Members had further points to raise and his Back Benchers were unable to debate amendments that they had tabled in a helpful and constructive manner. The Financial Secretary is treating the Committee with contempt—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. Surely my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary may, if he wishes, speak at the end of this debate—he does not have to speak at the beginning. He can then answer the points raised during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:How long the Minister or other Members of the Committee speak for is a matter for them. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman makes his own speech on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will. However, as I have not made a full speech so far, I have not had a chance to speak to the amendments or discuss how they affect the matters of substance in clause 69.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an outrage that the Financial Secretary should move a group of amendments which contain not only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
Government amendments but amendments selected for debate alongside them. The Back Benchers who have tabled amendments in the group receive no justification at the outset of the debate of the Government's attitude, nor has the Financial Secretary told them what his attitude is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not wash for the Financial Secretary to say that he will listen to the debate and see what is said. He will have his brief from the civil service, telling him to accept or reject each amendment in the group. The idea that the matter is up for debate or persuasion is parliamentary fiction rather than fact, certainly under the Financial Secretary's regime. Opposition Members are casting their minds back to the former halcyon days when agreements were reached and adhered to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It falls to me to explain Government amendment No. 166 and to refer to the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Esher (Mr. Taylor) and for Wyre (Mr. Mans). Both hon. Gentlemen have played a constructive part in the proceedings of this and previous Finance Bill Committees. We regard them with considerable affection, and welcome their contributions to our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer later to amendment No. 79, but I wish to turn specifically to the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentlemen—No. 175. It would substantially change the proposed new section 91A(4)(a), so that the provision stated:
	<br><q><p>"in connection with the restoration of a site, or part of a site, and".</p></q>
The amendment would delete from the Bill the words:
	<br><q><p>"which ceased to be used for the carrying out of waste disposal activities before the payment was made".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will have noticed that Government amendment No. 166 would make the same change, but in a more roundabout fashion. The Government are intent not only on deleting the same phrase as the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) seeks to delete, but on first deleting the words:
	<br><q><p>"or part of a site"</p></q>
and then reintroducing them to their original position. It would be useful if my hon. Friend explored the reasons why the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) has hit on a more elegant way of achieving the same objective as the Government, but without the army of the civil service behind him. Will my hon. Friend press the Government on why they are so clumsily trying to achieve the same objective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made two important points. The debate would have been facilitated enormously if the Financial Secretary had explained the reasoning behind the Government's amendments, which are bound to be accepted because Conservative Members form the majority of the Committee. He should have justified the method used by the Government to put their proposal into legislation, in preference to what seems, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said, the more elegant, straightforward and honest method adopted by the hon. Member for Esher. Amendment No. 175 is a concise way of achieving his desired objectives. Although the hon. Gentleman will not tell us
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
yet—I think that he is sulking—I suspect that the Financial Secretary shares his objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not be surpirsed to hear that amendment No. 79 emanated from the Law Society of Scotland. It is a helpful suggestion. I am happy to give way to its architect, the hon. Member for Esastwood (Mr. Stewart), if he wishes to confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman presumably received the same amendments as I did from the Law Society of Scotland and, of course, it is an amendment suggested by that body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather suspected that that was the case. We all enjoy the way in which the hon. Gentleman is willing to trawl the Scottish Law Society's helpful and constructive suggestions through the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 79 is worthy of our consideration. It has not come from Opposition Back Benchers or from advisers to the Opposition Front Bench, but from an independent body of unimpeachable reputation. The hon. Member for Eastwood tabled the amendment to help the Committee and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the wording of amendment No. 79? What does the phrase
	<br><q><p>"or as a result of a civil obligation"</p></q>
mean? Does it mean an obligation imposed as a result of legal action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) makes a helpful and timely intervention. I am sure that the Committee would welcome a brief contribution from the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) on that point. Amendment No.79 inserts in clause 69, page 57, line 11:
	<br><q><p>"or any other condition imposed by statute or as a result of a civil obligation.".</p></q>
The words
	<br><q><p>"any other condition imposed by statute"</p></q>
would have the desirable effect of making proposed section 91A(4)(b) as comprehensive as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central rightly pointed out that the amendment contains an additional condition of a civil obligation. Civil obligations can mean many things. I am not sure whether they have a meaning in Scottish law that they do not have in the law in England and Wales. Perhaps the hon. Member for Eastwood will correct me, or, perhaps I shall have to take advice from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) tomorrow morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A civil obligation can be the obligation to help a pensioner or a blind person across the road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is confused, which is quite understandable in such a debate and at such an hour, about the distinction between civic and civil. It might well be a civic obligation to help and elderly or disabled person across the road, but I find it had to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
believe that that could ever be a legally enforceable civil obligation. The old dear is hardly likely to take one to the High Court because one has failed to do the decent thing. However, a passer-by might take one to task about one's lack of civic responsibility. My hon. Friend's interesting interpretation might be correct. Again, it is an example of the consequences of the Minister failing to take the lead and give guidance in such a debate. As a result, one can fall into a trap or error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask because I do not know the answer, which, I suppose, is the usual reason for asking questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in this place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we are. After the helpful intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), it occurs to me that of course there is a difference between a civil and a civic obligation. If one undertook a civic obligation, one would not necessarily be undertaking a civil obligation, although in undertaking a civic obligation, one could leave oneself open to a negligence suit if one intervened intitially out of good-heartedness in a way that led to a mishap through negligence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must have in mind someone fulfiling a civic obligation by starting to help an old dear across the road, but stopping halfway and leaving—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Agist and sexist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An old person is a better expression, although an old dear could be a man or a woman. If one had embarked on a duty of care by starting to help an old person across the street, would one be in breach of it by leaving the old person in the middle of the road to be run over by a passing vehicle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to a good point and is right to raise it. The parallel with the abandonment of waste disposal sites halfway through infill and rehabilitation is only too clear. This legislation is designed to prevent that from happening and to ensure that civic and civil obligations are carried out fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the hon. Member for Eastwood intends by his use of the term "civil obligation". If an agreement were binding in the usual way of the commercial operation of a waste disposal site, of if an agreement were entered into for specific arrangements pertaining to the disposal of a particular type of waste or to the nature of the site to be completed, or later abandoned, those obligations should, as a matter of clear statement, be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you can probably tell, Mr. Coleman, I am not a professional lawyer, but one of the barrack room sort. It seems to me that the Bill does not exclude one's civil obligations. Nevertheless, I understand what the hon. Member for Eastwood is getting at. He hopes to make the legislation absolutely watertight so that, after the insertion of his amendment, section 91A(4)(b) would read:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
	<br><q><p>"in order to comply with any condition of the licence mentioned in subection (1) above, or any condition imposed on the grant of planning permission to use the site for the carrying out of waste disposal activities or any other condition imposed by statute or as a result of a civil obligation."</p></q>
That seems pretty comprehensive to me, but I wonder whether the amendment is necessary, given that subsection (4) already appears adequate. I raise that doubt, timorously, because subsection (4) is qualfied not only by paragraph (b), but by paragraph (a), whose conditions are fairly narrow. Subsection 4(a) states:
	<br><q><p>"For the purposes of this section a site restoration payment is a payment made—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) in connection with the restoration of a site, or part of a site, which ceased to be used for the carrying out of waste disposal activities before the payment was made".</p></q>
It is the deletion of the words—
	<br><q><p>"which ceased to be used for the carrying out of waste disposal activities before the payment was made"</p></q>
which must be considered when we examine the effect of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood. Is the proposed toughening of subsection 4(b) sufficient to qualify subsection 4(a), which includes the phrase—
	<br><q><p>"in connection with the restoration of a site"?</p></q>
We agree with the proposal in amendment No. 175 tabled by the hon. Member for Esher to retain the phrase—
	<br><q><p>"or part of a site"</p></q>
before deleting the remainder of subsection 4(a). I am not sure what effect that would have on the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood. I think that the Bill would be improved, but without the professional opinion of the Government's legal advisers and draftsmen it is difficult to form a balanced view. I am sure that the Committee would want private waste disposal operators, whose industry has a chequered history, to be encouraged by legislation, licensing procedures and the taxation system to leave sites with which they have finished in a condition that is safe, tidy and compatible with the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the amendments as if they referred to infill sites only. In most cases, that is probably true, but the legislation will also affect what are commonly and not always affectionately known as tips. Such sites are not infill sites, but corporation or private sector dumps. Private sector dumps will be affected by any amendments that the Committee will approve to the Taxes Act 1988. I suspect that at present most non-infill sites are run by local authorities and not by private operators, but as the Government are committed to privatising local authority services, that may not always be so. The management and ownership of public sector infill and non-infill sites may be compulsorily transferred to the private sector. Opposition Members are not in favour of that, but that is the Government's clear objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stray from the amendment, but my hon. Friend has raised an important point. I do not have a suspicious nature, but my hon. Friend's appeal to the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has met with deafening silence. That makes me wonder about the Government's intentions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
about waste disposal. Hon. Members who table amendments should be prepared to respond to questions put to them courteously and politely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) for that helpful intervention. My hon. Friend shares my reservations about the Government's privatisation programme and does not wish it to be extended further to local authority public services. It is the Government's stated policy to hand over services now properly carried out by local authorities to the private sector in such a way that it can make a profit out of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are many ways of making a profit from running a tip, a dump or an infill site. When this Bill becomes law in August or September it will determine the taxation treatment of infill sites and dumps run by the private sector, regardless of how they came to be in that sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's argument closely and I have a great deal of sympathy with him. I remind him that 20 per cent alone of all waste disposal sites are operated by waste disposal authorities. That means that 80 per cent of the industry is already in private hands, so my hon. Friend's fears about the future are already realities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw my attention and that of the Committee to the current ratio of site ownership by the public and private sectors. As my hon. Friend said, 20 per cent of sites are managed by waste disposal authorities and the remaining 80 per cent are managed in the private sector. That is a cautionary reminder to Opposition Members. We know that the Government have been most zealous in their privatisation programme in areas where there was already a mixture of private and public operation and where private companies claimed some expertise in areas that were covered properly by public authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend reflect on the view expressed by many private operators that the controls that are applied by some waste disposal authorities to their own sites are less stringent than those applied to private sites? Is that not a cause for anxiety? Waste is no respector of the private or public sector. If it is toxic or hazardous, it remains so whatever sector deals with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. It is no part of my argument to defend the matters of which I would not approve in either sector. I am a strong advocate of high quality public services. I am especially keen to ensure that public authorities have the proper resources and legislative backing for a regulatory function, whether the service is provided in the public or the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just heard some muttering—I even heard the Financial Secretary comment—about high-spending Labour local authorities. Will my hon. Friend draw the attention of those who mutter in that way to the evidence of the Association of County Councils to the Environment Select Committee? The ACC is not

noted for its sympathy towards the Labour party, but stated of the present regime of waste disposal authorities:
	<br><q><p>"You must trust a public authority to act in a reasonably philanthropic way."</p></q>
Will any hon. Gentlemen comment on the relative likelihood of finding philanthropy in public authorities and the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. Before the hon. Gentleman does so, perhaps he will explain succinctly how the matter is relevant to waste disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sentence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Just a few words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My fear is that this legislation will set the parameters not only for waste disposal companies that are currently in the private sector but the 20 per cent of sites that are owned by local authorities and which, under the Government's stated policy, will be transferred to the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I thank the hon. Gentleman for his clear explanation. I am sure that the Committee understands. Perhaps we could move faster on this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be happy to move on, after giving way to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) referred to high spending on waste disposal by local authorities, and the danger of waste disposal facilities being covered by the amendments were such facilities to be brought into the private sector. My mind was drawn to the Byker reclamation plant, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) and with which I was once involved. It was a high-spending facility. If it were privatised, the amendments would enable a private company to receive tax relief for pulling down that marvellous, unique facility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not respond to that intervention. He has already clearly explained himself, and if he goes down that road he will be guilty of tedious repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my time in Parliament—I have been a Member since the glorious day when I defeated Mr. Mike Thomas in the 1983 general election, a day still joyously celebrated in Newcastle upon Tyne, East by all political parties—I have spoken in many debates.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I did not accuse the hon. Gentleman of tedious repetition.

charge from someone whom I hold in such deep affection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now discuss amendment No. 208, which is the Opposition's main amendment. I shall deal later with amendment No. 177, which was tabled by the hon. Members for Esher and for Wyre. It makes a slightly different point, but it is selected with the other amendments, so I shall not trespass on your patience if 1 refer to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 208 would be inserted at the end of line 11 after the phrase, "waste disposal activities." I apologise to the Committee for what may be a drafting error at the end of the phrase—the full stop would have to be changed to a comma or a semicolon, although if the amendment is accepted that could be dealt with as a drafting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that would be acceptable to the Committee. If not, it could not have been acceptable on the previous Government amendment, which meant that a subsection ended with a comma rather than the full stop that the draftsman would have insisted on if things were being done properly. We do not quibble about that, Mr. Coleman. We realise that points about punctuation that have no other import can be dealt with by parliamentary draftsmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 208 seeks to extend subsection(4)(b) to new section 91A of the Taxes Act 1988. It is no small thing to insert a whole new section into a Taxes Act. Our proposed addition would set out in law how disposal sites are to be treated for tax purposes until such matters come to be amended again by a future Finance Bill Committee. I expect that that will be far in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to ensure that there are no anomalies. That is why amendment No. 208 begins:
	<br><q><p>"and for the avoidance of doubt".</p></q>
We then have two new subparagraphs—
	<br><q><p>"(i) a site shall not be regarded as not having ceased to be used for the carrying out of waste disposal activities if, after initial restoration, further waste is disposed of on the site to enable restoration to be effected more efficiently, economically or conveniently, and".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy that my hon. Friend is dealing with the amendment in some detail. I have been studying the report of the Select Committee on Environment on the disposal of toxic waste, which concluded that the long-term health of the United Kingdom economy depends on its ability to handle waste management problems in a cost-effective but publicly acceptable way. That Committee received considerable evidence of public disquiet about the waste disposal industry. For instance, it mentioned a site in Cumbria where licence conditions were constantly breached. It is right that my hon. Friend should pay great attention to the detail of the amendments. It was, of course, an all-party Committee that drew up those conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for her intervention. The Opposition are grateful to the work of that all-party Committee. We hope that we parallel its work in our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is in two parts. I have read the first part, which ends with the word "and". It continues:
	<br><q><p>"(ii) where".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
1.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have the Committee's undivided attention. After all, we must vote on the amendments at some stage. I accept that without the guidance of the Financial Secretary it is difficult for members of the party in Government to know what line to take. Without a clear explanation of the amentments from the Financial Secretary, the best that is available to the Committee is my explanation of these complex but interesting matters. I hope that I have the Minister's undivided attention. I am discussing the Government's legislation, so it behoves the hon. Gentleman to take an interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (ii) of amendment No. 208 states:
	<br><q><p>"where materials are purchased prior to a site ceasing to be used for the carrying out of waste disposal activities, and those materials can reasonably be regarded as purchased for the purpose of later restoring the site, and are in fact so used"—</p></q>
there is not much room for abuse there—
	<br><q><p>"such materials shall for the purposes of this section be regarded as having been purchased immediately before they are so used."</p></q>
Our amendment was tabled in a spirit of constructive goodwill towards the broad thrust of the clause, with which we have no great quarrel. The workings of the legislation would be set out clearly so that private sector practitioners will know exactly where they stand. The Labour party is standing up for the waste disposal industry and is trying to clarify matters. The Government, who pretend to do so much for the private sector, will not even tell the Committee where they stand on the issue. Instead of taking steps to ensure clarification, the Financial Secretary delierately fosters doubt by refusing to speak to the Committee, by sulking and making us wait.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is detaining me from speaking in the debate. He is well aware that in all previous debates, I have allowed other hon. Members to speak before responding. I am not sure what he is getting at. Perhaps his attitude to the waste disposal industry is shown by the way in which he has treated the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a shocking thing to say! I should have thought that the amount of time, attention, respect and interest that we have shown in the clause would be widely welcomed by everyone involved in the waste disposal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government tabled amendment No. 166. If the amendment had been tabled by someone else, I could understand the Financial Secretary waiting to hear the reasons for it. We are debating a Government amendment, and unless there was some cross-party agreement that the Financial Secretary should wait for us, he should have spoken to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, in his usual concise way, puts his finger on a most important point. It is astonishing that the Financial Secretary should think that we are showing disrespect to an industry just because we choose to discuss its affairs, and because the Labour party seeks to insert into the legislation an amendment, selected for debate and set out on the amendment paper, that is intended for the avoidance of doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
How can the Financial Secretary say that we are treating the industry with disrespect, or lack of affection, or in a high-handed and callous way? The Financial Secretary also suggested that if only I would stop speaking he would be able to explain the Government amendment that I believe should have been moved first. The Financial Secretary had the opportunity; I made it clear that if he rose I would not. The Financial Secretary could have introduced this group of amendments which is headed by Government amendment No. 166. Because he did not do so, it falls to me to discuss the group. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall move on; I shall not be detained by heckling from the Conservative Benches. Conservative Members are trying to goad me into incurring your wrath, Mr. Coleman, which I would not do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has already incurred my wrath by labouring that point. Please move on to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly; that is what I wanted to do, Mr. Coleman. I hope that you accept that I was incited by Conservative Members into incurring your wrath by again saying that the Financial Secretary failed in his duty to introduce this group of amendments. I would not have done so had I not been provoked by heckling. I am more than willing to give way to any Conservative Member who is awake and wishes to take part in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now move on, Mr. Coleman, to deal with the other amendments in the group, tabled not by me or by the Parliamentary Labour Party, but by Conservative Members who feel that they have something to contribute to our debate on clause 69. The amendments were tabled, I am sure, in a constructive spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 177 seeks to insert in the Bill, at the end of line 11 on page 57, a new subsection—(4A). The amendment raises two problems: first, the nomenclature of the new subsection is confusing, as we already have a subsection 4(a), so that is not good parliamentary draftsmanship. Secondly, the amendment is not comparable with our amendment No. 208, which seeks to avoid doubt, and it is divided into two paragraphs, (i) and (ii). If the Committee wishes to accept the spirit of both amendments, with good will and sufficient enthusisam we could no doubt find a way round the drafting issues, but we may have to do it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing the hon. Member for Esher explain the new subsection and his other amendments in the group. But his new subsection would be inserted in a part of the Bill that deals with definitions which, in turn, would be inserted as amendments to the Taxes Act 1988 as new section 91 A. It is no small matter that we are discussing. The hon. Gentleman also proposes to insert new subsection (4A). Again I do not like it at all; it is ugly. I intend no disrespect to the hon. Members for Esher and for Wyre (Mr. Mans) in respect of their motives, but the nomenclature is ugly and the amendments do not fit at all well with the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their proposed new subsection would commence:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"For the purposes of this section",</p></q>
or, in other words, it seeks to qualify the whole of section 91A, not just the relevant subsections, all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
way down to subsection (7). Amendment No. 177 therefore states:
	<br><q><p>"For the purposes of this section site restoration payments which are made by a person within a period of six years immediately following the last day on which he carried on a trade comprising waste disposal activities shall, to the extent that they have not otherwise been allowed as a deduction in computing the profits or gains of any trade, be treated as paid by him on the last day on which he carried on that trade."</p></q>
The hon. Member for Esher should explain what exactly he intends by this amendment. I suspect that he is seeking to provide a device whereby site operators who had abandoned their site or pulled out of the business could mop up subsequent costs. The allowable time period is generous:
	<br><q><p>"six years immediately following the last day on which he carried on a trade comprising waste disposal activities."</p></q>
Surely that is long time for people to be allowed to offset theit costs. The amendments may be well intentioned, but it needs justification. I may be unaware of special factors in the industry, about which the hon. Gentleman with his expert and specialist knowledge could enlighten us. The six-year period may be justifiable, but I need to be convinced. On the face of it, it seems far too long to a lay person, as I profess myself to be. I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to speak more generally about the issues surrounding waste disposal, and later on I shall take the opportunity to do so. Presently, however, I shall confine my remarks to the narrow purpose of the amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham formally deals with the issues for the Front Bench. I have offered only an introduction because the Financial Secretary was unable to do so. I hope that I have given the Committee a reasonable insight into broader matters under discussion, and that we can now proceed to have a good and comprehenisve debate on other important amendments. As you pointed out though, Mr. Coleman, the amendments also have to be dealt with specifically in their own context without the wider debate on the broad thrust of the legislation that many hon. Members will want later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
