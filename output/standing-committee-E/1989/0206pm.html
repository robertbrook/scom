<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 18, line 27, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) The system of joint finance shall be protected and extended at the level of 3 per cent. above the prevailing level of inflation.'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. Much anxiety has been expressed about the future of projects that exist on the basis of join finance. Health authorities and local authorities jointly finance a range of important services. From reading the White Paper and the Bill I find it hard to see how, in a contract system, joint finance projects will be safeguarded, and the services that they provide secured. I have been asked, for example, how a contract could be used for drop-in work. Who will work out who uses a drop-in service, in which people constantly come and go? What about outreach work, whereby community workers, who are funded by joint finance, go to schools, community
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
centres and nursery groups? Who will decide who should pay the bill for such work? Typically, those projects help people with aids, alcoholism, and drug-related problems, as well as well known schemes involving mentally handicapped people. Such schemes provide a link between health and social services. What will happen to the Lewisham and North Southwark district health authority scheme which provides respite care for carers of people with learning difficulties?<br><br>
Harrowlands centre in Dorking which provides counseling for 16 to 20-year-old physically handicapped people could not exist without the social worker who is funded by joint finance. What will happen to such schemes in future?<br><br>
Joint finance has provided voluntary organisations with a voice in the direction of spending, because joint consultative committees include voluntary representatives. We are worried that voluntary organisations will lose that influence if joint finance is removed. The Minister should assure us about the finance and planning of such schemes and tell us that voluntary involvement will continue.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) will listen to the Minister's reply, which I shall read carefully in Hansard, as there is a boy, Harry, in the Committee Room who is celebrating his seventh birthday and I shall be giving him his birthday tea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet, will you adjourn the Committee so that we can all go?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the best reason for an adjournment that I have heard so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee, I wish Harry a happy birthday.<br><br>
Joint finance is the mechanism whereby £120 million of health resources is devoted to schemes involving a joint agreement among RHAs, DHAs and voluntary organisations. Its introduction in 1976 reflected the need to care for certain groups in the community. Plans for such agreements can be implemented only through joint consultative committees. Many hon. Members will know of such agreements in their constituencies.<br><br>
The schemes have been valuable. In 1987–88, 42 per cent. of their resources were spent on the care of the elderly, 43 per cent. on the care of the handicapped, and unfortunately only 5 per cent. on the care of the mentally ill and disabled. Those figures are a commentary on the relative importance placed on those services by local authorities. They are one reason why we shall debate the specific grant for the community care of the mentally ill.<br><br>
About 60 per cent. of the resources are spent for revenue purposes and 40 per cent. for capital purposes. There is a taper in joint finance schemes. Understandably, local authorities are sometimes reluctant to take responsibility for pump-priming schemes that have been initiated with health authority and local authority money, because of the revenue consequences. The Government have reached no conclusions about the future of joint finance but we shall review the options in the spring and summer. We shall inform Parliament of any proposals to change joint finance at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>
The options range from recycling all those resources through local authorities, either with specific grants or non-specific grants, ring-fenced or not, perhaps through regional health authorities to local authorities—as we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0739">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 721</span>
propose for the mentally ill—or through district health authorities or the Department. We are considering the options carefully. I assure the Committee that, as paragraph 6.14 of the White Paper on community care, "Caring for People" states, we have a commitment to community care and the resources will not be withdrawn and used for other purposes. Given that we accept the bulk of Griffiths's recommendations, we are looking for the most effective way of carrying forward joint finance. I repeat my commitment that when we have reached a conclusion, which I hope will be in the summer, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will come to the House and properly report his conclusions and recommendations for the future. There will then be an opportunity to debate the continuance of a valuable and important scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The performance in Committee of my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) is described as "glacial" in the current edition of the <i>Health Service Journal.</i> I hope that the warmth and human interest in her department from our proceedings this afternoon will go a long way towards redressing the balance of her image. On my hon. Friend's behalf, I am happy to accept the Minister's assurances and will draw them to her attention. In the circumstances she would not wish to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Technically, I have to put the Question as only the person who moved the amendment may beg to ask leave to withdraw it.</span></p>

<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
<p>Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins<span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is perhaps our only opportunity to explore further the system of weighted capitation which the Government propose using as the basis of allocation to regions, districts and, in slightly different form, to practice budgets. Some questions about the system arise.<br><br>
I was about to give a small chirp rather than a cheer for the fact that the resource allocation working party, having been bundled so unceremoniously out of the front door, has now been partially allowed in though the back door, through the tradesmen's entrance, so that the basis of the old RAWP system, which is moribund, will play some part in the new system of weighted capitation. That is to be welcomed, but much more needs to be known and said.<br><br>
The weighted capitation system will be weighted for seven age groups, and by notional health costs for those groups. This may sound extremely technical, but much will depend on it in terms of the distribution of health resources. Those areas where population tends to decline or stagnate will be utterly dependent for service development on the working of the formula for service development. I assume that the formula is still in the process of being developed. However, we ought to seek an assurance from the ministerial team that, when it is known, it will be published in draft form and subject not merely to debate among regional authorities and chairpeople but more generally, so that all of us can contribute to discussion of how it is to develop. In my northern region we shall be utterly dependent upon the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
working of the weighted capitation formula for service development. The method of working it out is of critical importance to us. This is not simply a subject for discussion at small closed meetings; it must be open to public, and perhaps parliamentary, debate.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to reiterate the assurance that he gave almost in passing this morning that whereas from 1992–3 the system of weighted capitation will be the basis of allocation to regions, there will still be some flexibility for RHAs to modify the formula in whichever way they choose to form the basis of allocation to DHAs. For big city hospitals, such as Newcastle, Manchester and Leeds, that element of flexibility will be essential if the present pattern of hospital services is to survive in anything like its present form. It is important that the Minister repeats more clearly this morning's assurance about flexibility over allocations within the regions.
4.45pm<br><br>
Over the years of RAWP there has been great debate about how to introduce social factors that are obviously relevant to health and to the distribution of health authority resources. Various attempts have been made but none was satisfactory because gauges of deprivation, by their nature, measure deprivation at the time, whereas deprivation that contributes to health costs is a lifetime's deprivation and is not necessarily measured in people's current experience.<br><br>
We hope that the Government have not given up on the prospect of making provision in the weighted capitation formula system for an indicator of deprivation and, in particular, indicators of people's social situation. Elderly single people who live alone will be more expensive to provide health services for than the elderly who do not live alone—they may have a partner or a family who can provide for them. People living alone at any age are likely to have longer stays in hospital. Their in-patient treatment is usually longer and they are likely to form the bulk of the so-called bed blockers whose costs are most likely higher. We should like an assurance that this matter will be kept under review so that the weighted capitation formula can be sensitive to the social situation of the elderly and those suffering from chronic illness who may live alone.<br><br>
Another factor—which I have taken trouble to work out with advice from people in the north—is that apparently the number of elderly single people varies from area to area. In two reasonably large health authorities —Bournemouth and Gateshead—the number of elderly single people is considerable. It takes little imagination to realise that the costs of providing care for elderly single people in Bournemouth are lower than the costs of the same care in Gateshead. The people of Bournemouth are likely to have greater financial resources and their lifestyles are less likely to have triggered the patterns of chronic illness which, unfortunately, are still all too familiar in Gateshead. Again I hope that the system of weighted capitation will not remain in its present form, but will be continuously revised to take account of those factors.<br><br>
My final point is, on a different subject. How are students to be provided for under the system? In my city, Newcastle, there are between 20,000 and 30,000 in-migrant students. Is the intent to provide for them within the weighted capitation system of allocation to the district, or are they to be provided for by an inevitably long-winded and bureaucratic process whereby the health authority in Newcastle reclaims from their home authority the costs of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 723</span>
their treatment? The Minister knows that the cost of providing health care for young men can be high because of the incidence of accidents which gives rise to complicated conditions that are expensive to treat. I hope that the Minister will consider some of those issues and, if he cannot answer all of them now, that he will say when he will clarify them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On allocations to regions, I repeat that we will commence during 1990–91, and shall continue over the two subsequent years, to move all regions to weighted capitation over a three-year period. Weighted capitation for regions is a strict definition, which includes weightings for demography. I have already answered a parliamentary Question from the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) on this but I repeat that there is nothing secret about the relative weightings for the age brackets in our demography weightings. We break the age of the population into brackets and, broadly speaking, the very young and the elderly need more health care than those in their teens or mid-life. The Government will be happy to share more details about the demographic weightings, for we have nothing to hide.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman will know, we are also taking a standardised mortality ratio for a region and weighting it by a factor of 0·5. That is the same as taking the square root of the factor. That may sound complicated mathematically, but giving a weighting factor of 0.5 seems to be the most equitable and sensible way of reflecting the relative health of the different regions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about students. We shall count them where they attend university, because we shall rely on data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. We shall use population estimates based on the place of residence on 30 June. The OPCS records students where they are at college and not where they live. We shall have to correct the data from the census, which I think falls on 21 April, because it will record the residence of students just before their summer term begins. We shall reflect the residency of students who have not returned to college or university as being in the district where they are studying. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied by that assurance.<br><br>
I hope that I made it clear this morning that there is room for flexibility in regions' allocations to districts. We are not being over-prescriptive about the methods that regions should use, and have mentioned two additional factors that may be appropriate. The regions, of which there are 14 in England, are large enough for the Department to have a limited number of factors on which to distribute equitably the funds that are available to the Health Service. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to point to additional factors that regions may have to take into account. He mentioned social deprivation and the Jarman index, and there are others, which it may be appropriate for regions to reflect in their allocations.<br><br>
Regions should begin moving towards weighted capitation in the financial year 1991–92. Some regions propose to start moving in the coming year, 1990–91. All regions should make a start by 1991–92, which is the year of residency funding. The time that it will take regions to move all districts to full weighted capitation will vary according to regional circumstances and may take several years. I hope that I have answered all the hon. Gentleman's points.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How finely tuned is the basis on which the calculations about morbidity are made? Are they made on a district-by-district basis, or across the board? Will there be scope for argument, perhaps between the DHA and the RHA, that the allocations are unreasonable, because the fine-tuning of the morbidity statistics has not been fully taken into account?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We obviously take the regional standardised mortality ratio in regional allocations, but the district standardised mortality ratio will be appropriate for the allocations to districts. If a district has a higher relative mortality rate than others there is a mechanism to reflect that in the region's allocations to it. That factor should be taken into account.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central is satisfied with my answer. If there are any points that I have not answered, I should be happy to study the record and write to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with the assurance that we can begin a dialogue on the subject. The system of weightings for weighted capitation still remains relatively general. We must engage in a more detailed discussion about it, if we are to get the assurances that we want.<br><br>
I am a little disturbed that the Minister now says that the regions will be expected, admittedly at their own pace, to move to a system of weighted capitation. I greatly fear what will happen to the great hospital centres of our northern cities such as Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield if there is no flexibility within the region to recognise the historical role of those centres of excellence, their enormous teaching commitments and their part in developing new standards of care for patients.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That this schedule, as amended, be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell<span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief speech on schedule 4 stand part. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State knows, I have always been a tremendous fan of the work that the Audit Commission does. Two years ago, I tabled a question to his predecessor asking whether the Audit Commission should be invited to look at the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the Health Service to see that it managed and deployed its resources in the best possible manner. It has taken two years to reach that point. Many of us have campaigned for the Audit Commission to do value-for-money studies in the Health Service to ensure that best practice prevails, and that we encourage practices that give best value for money in the promotion of patient care.<br><br>
I am dismayed at one provision in schedule 4, and it can best be described as follows. Section 27 of the Local Government Finance Act 1982 empowered the Audit Commission to review the value-for-money effect of ministerial guidance or directions and statutory provisions. However, schedule 4 provides for the external audit of the NHS to be taken over by the Audit Commission and paragraph 19 will effectively stop the provisions of section 27 of the 1982 Act applying to ministerial guidance, directions and statutory provisions in the Health Service. That would be a mistake.<br><br>
Perhaps I should develop my case further. I am grateful to the Library for furnishing me with information about events that took place long before I was privileged to come to this place. In 1982 the Government did not commence the Bill on the basis of giving away section 27. Indeed, the intention then was exactly the same as today: that it should not include ministerial decisions and directions within the remit of the Audit Commission.<br><br>
At the time, there was great pressure in Committee from both sides because this is not a party-political issue; it is about keeping the executive accountable and making sure that the value-for-money studies performed by the Audit Commission do some good. At that time, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, who was then a Minister in the Department of the Environment, conceded that it would be right to amend the Bill, and an amendment was moved in the Lords. When it returned to the Floor of the House of Commons, my right hon. Friend said that he regarded the amendment as an important step forward in terms of the accountability of Ministers to the House, and he thought that Ministers in key spending Departments should accept that the disciplines of the Audit Commission were a legitimate part of the scrutiny of the executive.<br><br>
Above all, at that time, two particular arguments held sway: first, that from time to time Ministers make mistakes. That is unusual in this Government but it has happened in the past. There is merit in accepting the idea and allowing the Audit Commission to take it into account. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it protects Ministers to allow this process to take place. At the moment, a local authority could easily hide behind the effects of this section and argue that although there may be a strong case for a value-for-money study in a particular area, as it affects the decision made by the Minister, which is not allowed to be examined by the Audit Commission, it cannot be proceeded with. I believe that that would be a mistake. The commission may well think that something is bad value for money but if it stems from a ministerial decision it cannot proceed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0742">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
It is incumbent upon Ministers, in debating the schedule, to explain why it is so important for the decision to be excluded. Perhaps it is thought that there could be a clash with the National Audit Office, but the Audit Commission will collect a great deal of information and knowledge by being responsible for the external audit of authorities. That sort of knowledge and information would not be available to the National Audit Office.<br><br>
There is also a likelihood that the need for value-for-money studies would become clear to the Audit Commission during the course of its work. If that need became clear then the commission would have that great body of knowledge derived from its work to conduct such a study.<br><br>
Thirdly, under NHS legislation the Secretary of State is ultimately responsible for just about everything that happens in the NHS. He has extensive powers to direct health authorities, quite apart from the many requirements placed on authorities through circulars from his Department. Page 11 of "Working for Patients" says that:
<br><blockquote><p> "Delegation downwards must be matched by accountability upwards."</p></blockquote>
The Audit Commission could find itself in great difficulty if it cannot consider fully the effects of directions and ministerial guidance. The statutory relationship between local authorities and central Government, which is the subject of the 1982 Act, is much less close than the statutory relationship between health authorities and central Government.<br><br>
If the schedule proceeds as drafted, there could also be technical difficulties. What happens if the Audit Commission wants to investigate community care, which is the responsibility of local authorities and health authorities? It will be difficult if the Audit Commission has different powers in respect of each of those two great organisations. If we look at "Making a Reality of Community Care", again and again Sir Roy Griffiths confirms the Audit Commission's analysis and pays tribute to it. Yet, arguably, that report could not have been carried out if Ministers had not agreed to section 27 of the 1982 Act and those provisions which do not currently apply in this schedule.<br><br>
In addition, to give a specific example, the White Paper entitled "Caring for People" said in paragraph 8.26:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has decided to create a specific grant to encourage the development of social care for people with a mental illness to be paid via health authorities."</p></blockquote>
What will happen if local authorities are having problems with the way this grant is allocated? Although it will be paid by health authorities, the rules and criteria governing it will presumably be laid down by the Secretary of State. More generally, perhaps, successful community care requires close collaboration between health and local authorities.<br><br>
What will the commission's position be when investigating directions or other actions from the NHS management executive? The Government may say that the commission can investigate its guidance or other actions since it is part of the management structure of the NHS and so would not be covered by any provision excluding the actions of the Secretary of State. On the other hand, if it is argued that the management executive is part of the Department of Health and its actions are in the Secretary of State's name or on his behalf, the position would presumably be different.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
No doubt Ministers have a persuasive case, but it would be better for my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to consider whether he is missing a trick. I understand the anxiety of the Department of Health about the Audit Commission looking at the structure of the NHS. However, that is not a legitimate reason to argue against the Audit Commission doing so. Ministers should not be coy.<br><br>
The Audit Commission is a force for good. It promotes value for money and has done an enormous amount of good work in respect of local authorities. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will review the matter and consider whether the schedule could be improved by making minor adjustments to accommodate some of my arguments on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell). He deployed his case well, and Ministers should take his arguments seriously.<br><br>
There are three matters which should not be at issue. First, we are all anxious to achieve value for money in the Health Service. Secondly, the effect of Government guidance, directions or statutory provisions on the economy, efficiency or effectiveness of the NHS should be subject to scrutiny. Governments should not arrange it otherwise. Thirdly, someone has to do that job. The question is who should do it.<br><br>
I anticipate that if we follow the trail of parliamentary responsibility rather than that of audit, the Minister may say, "Well, the NHS is almost entirely under the control of the Secretary of State, by statute. He is responsible to the House and he should answer for the entire job." There is a logic, therefore, in getting the National Audit Office to do the work. It has already done some work in the Health Service, in relation to the striking differences in the use of operating theatres, including a study, for example, of my health district in Northampton. We do not necessarily rule out the NAO doing such general studies.<br><br>
I hope, however, that the Minister will reflect on what my hon. Friend said in relation to the role of the Audit Commission. It is active in community care and has led the way towards Griffiths and the post-Griffiths developments in the Bill. The commission is also good at comparative league tables and studies in comparison between the operations of local authorities. The Bill enjoins it to audit the activities of health authorities and as a result it seems logical and sensible for it to build up exercises. It will then be the appropriate body to carry out the studies. The Minister need not be embarrassed or frightened about that. It is in the interests of Parliament and the Government that we achieve—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a valid point. The partnership between local authorities and health authorities must be much more successful in future. It is logical and reasonable that the two types of authority should be subject to the same form of financial discipline as exercised by the Audit Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. My hon. Friend has an excellent point. There is a communality of interest. Elderly patients —customers if hon. Members wish—will receive community care and health services. They probably will not have heard of the Audit Commission or the NAO, but they will want someone to ensure efficiency in the Health Service. They should reflect on the best mechanism for achieving the desired results.We are anxious to get better

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 729</span>
performance from the Health Service. I shall be interested in what my hon. Friend says now, and in what he may suggest at a later stage in the Bill's proceedings.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) and my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), deployed powerful arguments. The role of the Audit Commission is destined to become important in the National Health Service. It is an independent body that will take on responsibility for the statutory audit of Health Service bodies and, as my hon. Friends said, a review of issues of public interest and for value for money. That might include, for example, authorities acting ultra vires, perhaps if there were a scandal, when they should report promptly to a higher authority, and also value for money.<br><br>
As schedule 4 makes clear, the Audit Commission will also cover NHS trusts and general practice fund holders, although the audit cycle for the general practice fund holders will be every three years except when it is essential that there is a more regular or frequent audit.<br><br>
My hon. Friends raised the issue whether the NHS should be on all fours with local authorities in relation to the powers of the Audit Commission. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health is in a different position from that of the Secretary of State for the Environment in the sense that his policy directions to the Health Service are made after consulting the National Health Service policy board and implemented through the management executive. He is accountable to Parliament for those policy decisions and for the execution of those decisions in the Health Service. The Secretary of State for the Environment is not. His position in relation to the local authorities is different.<br><br>
Existing legislation gives the Audit Commission the power to report on the consequences of policy decisions by local authorities. It is appropriate because there is no other mechanism for Paliament, for the Secretary of State for the Environment and for the public to assess what local authorities are doing. There is a clear distinction between the two.<br><br>
Another factor to be borne in mind is the role of the National Audit Office, which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry mentioned. The NAO is to some extent performing the role of advising on policy. My hon. Friend mentioned reports on the estate. There are others including those on financial management and on operating theatres. The Secretary of State and the Department of Health have studied other, highly relevant National Audit Office reports with great care. There is an existing body that reports directly to the Public Accounts Committee and the Department on policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's helpful remarks, but he will accept that there is a distinction between an appreciation of the general position and the drawing of examples. I cited the difference between the case of operating theatres and a general overview of the practice of all health authorities in a particular discipline. I do not ask my hon. Friend for a definitive answer now, but I want him to consider whether there could be better provision for the details, perhaps by joint activity or exchange of information with the NAO if the Minister cannot accept our suggestions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend anticipates my next remarks. Our debates has been interesting and we shall reflect on what my hon. Friends the Members for Gedling and for Daventry said. I shall write to my hon. Friends and set out what has been achieved in the last few months in terms of the value-for-money audit. The Audit Commission already has the statutory power to do that for the NHS. It has made a start on nursing management and has plans to extend the value-for-money audit across broad subject areas.<br><br>
I hope that we shall be able to accommodate the arguments that have been advanced this afternoon by defining more precisely the Audit Commission's role in value-for-money audit, there being no clear division between value-for-money audits covering large subject areas and overall responsibility for reviewing policy directives by the Secretary of State. I shall consider what has been said in the debate, and write to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. If he is not satisfied, no doubt we shall return to the matter later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke<span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) made a constructive speech, and I wonder whether the Minister would care to address his main argument—that, prima facie, the powers of the Audit Commission seen to be weakened, rather than strengthened, especially in relation to ring-fencing for the mentally handicapped, as distinct from the mentally ill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that most courteous reminder that I had not addressed that argument. It is clear that moneys emanating from the NHS —one thinks in terms of the specific grant—fall squarely within the responsibilities of the Audit Commission because they are NHS moneys. Moneys coming to social services departments for the care of the frail elderly do not come from Department of Health Votes.<br><br>
I should like to reflect on the matter, and there is no sense in my seeking to be definitive this afternoon. It is an important matter which relates to our earlier debate on joint finance. I shall reflect, and then write to the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke), sending a copy to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling. I rule out drawing a close parallel between environment and health, but I hope that I can go a long way towards solving the problem by defining more clearly what we mean by value-for-money audit. We are all striving for the same objective—an independent assessment of how finite resources in the hospital service are managed and deployed. I hope that I have satisfied my hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may respond briefly to the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister. I thank him for his constructive response to my comments and to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). Our principal concern relates to paragraph 19, because it appears to exempt ministerial decisions unnecessarily from scrutiny. I thank my hon. Friend for saying that he will see whether anything further can be done, but I urge him not to be too coy. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bridgewater (Mr. King) who is now the Secretary of State for Defence, accepted that it is of benefit when Ministers allow such scrutiny to take place. The argument that there is a difference between health authorities and local government cuts both ways,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0744">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
and arguably the benefit of deleting paragraph 19 would actually be greater for health authorities than for local government.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for saying that he will consider the matter further, and for the constructive way in which he responded to what I and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said.</span></p>

<p>No. 608, in clause 34, page 37, line 27, leave out subsection (2).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, Dame Janet, I thank you for that new and helpful grouping because it enables me to speak to all the amendments in one speech and will, I trust, expedite our proceedings. Unfortunately, I have omitted to table an amendment similar to amendment No. 617 to clause 34, which deals with The Scottish Medical Practices Committee. It is clear that my computer system has broken down. It underlines the need for excellent computer systems as we move towards hospital trusts, because what should have been an amendment did not materialise, although the intention was there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my experience that when computers go wrong, the operator is usually to blame, not the computer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that comment in the spirit in which it was made, but bearing in mind the failure of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) at times to table proper Scottish amendments, he, too, suffers from a similar deficiency.<br><br>
The amendments would ensure that the Secretary of State at least consulted the medical professions and other bodies before making changes to the constitution and functions of the General Medical Council. The views of the Medical Practices Committees should also be taken into account because of their experience and knowledge.<br><br>
One of the achievements of the past 40 years is the increased number of GPs serving the entire country. In Scotland—certainly, in the scattered highlands and islands in my constituency—doctors can be found in communities which would have been unable to support a doctor, and that has been achieved by the MPCs of England, Scotland and Wales.<br><br>
The constitution of the committees ensures a balanced membership between medical and lay members. That is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
important, because lay members often see the need for a doctor from a patient's point of view, while medical members can advise on what is medically desirable and practicable in offering a service.<br><br>
When the MPCs were established in 1948, the more desirable parts of England and Wales had more than enough family doctors. Elsewhere, more than 50 per cent. of the population lived in severely undoctored areas—in other words, they did not have sufficient doctors. It is worth reminding ourselves of the success of the Health Service, because averge list sizes at the outset were 3,500, and were double that figure in some areas.<br><br>
As the MPC for England and Wales states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Today there is a spread of GPs across England and Wales which permits an equality of access to the health services which is unequalled elsewhere. The result has been achieved by the MPC using its process of negative direction which of course must be maintained in the long term to prevent the inevitable regression in favour of more attractive areas".</p></blockquote>
Does the Secretary of State want to maintain that modus operandi in the future?<br><br>
According to the notes on clauses, clause 20(4) will allow the Secretary of State to direct the MPCs on the exercise of their functions, or on any additions or changes to those functions. What changes does the Secretary of State have in mind? The committee's principal function is to control the distribution of GPs throughout the country, and they do that by considering all applications for inclusion on the medical list of FPCs and by reviewing the need to fill practice vacancies. That is not done in isolation; it is done in consultation with both FPCs and LMCs. They divide the localities within individual FPC catchment areas into various classification areas, based on rough doctor: patient ratios. Adequate ratios are classified in terms of intermediate on restricted, and under-doctored areas—a phrase that I do not very much like, but the Secretary of State will know what I mean—are classified as open.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
I say by way of background, because I think that the committees have an important role, that an application from an eligible doctor to go to an open area will be routinely granted. The latest figures show that 57 areas out of 1,477 remain open. This is not a great number, which must be a tribute to the work of the MPCs. But the figure is too high to have existing arrangements played around with and not to have built-in provisions for consultation of the type suggested by my amendments.<br><br>
The statutory ground on which an application can be refused is that the number of GPs in a locality is already adequate. This is obviously important because the MPCs do not exist to grant applications endlessly. They already have the statutory power to refuse unnecessary additions or replacements. They can take account of many relevant national or regional factors such as morbidity and demographic variations, or meet the needs of special campaigns in inner cities. Another factor might be the encouragement of more women doctors.<br><br>
Local factors derived from family practitioner committees such as general planning objectives and local demographic factors may be included. Local features connected with the practice itself may be considered— questions such as whether the population in a given area is expanding, which ethnic features are present and which factors relate to a local industry, for example. Coal mining in the constituency of the hon. Member for Barnsley, West
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0745">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
and Penistone (Mr. McKay) was mentioned. That is an example of how account would be taken of specific local features.<br><br>
Stringent rules govern increases in intermediate or restricted areas. Details are sought of the practice under consideration, as are details of practices within five miles of it or, if the area is densely built-up, within half a mile to one mile. Other information can include everything from traffic congestion to local drug problems, nursing homes and housing developments.<br><br>
The MPCs use the information to decide the size of the notional list. This is not an arbitrary figure. Adjustment is made if it is above the national figure, units being awarded in rural areas, with a weighting of one notional patient for each 25 units. A notional patient is also added for each three temporary resident patients treated in the past year. An additional workload factor is added if the number of elderly patients is more than 16 per cent. of a doctor's list.<br><br>
I have tried to show the extent of the committees' valuable role and the way in which they take account of information, weighing and evaluating it carefully. Looking at the track record, the figures for 1948 and the current figures it can be seen that the committees have done a good job. It would be an example of good will as well as of good sense to build in provision for the sort of consultation that I have proposed.<br><br>
Their latest report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In looking to the future the Committee recognises that the normally expected process of change in medical manpower matters is going to be affected by the availability and use of health and social data which will give a better measure on a national basis of the relative need for medical services."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the general sentiment will be echoed by anyone interested in the general well-being of the Health Service who wishes to underscore it. I trust that the Government will recognise the need for additional data, accept that it will be forthcoming and ensure that those who have the experience to interpret it are made members of committees, playing a full part and being consulted fully about changes or developments.<br><br>
The same argument applies in the Scottish context, to which clause 34 relates. I shall say a word or two about this because I represent a Scottish constituency.<br><br>
The purpose of the Scottish MPC was to quote the Secretary of State who founded it, to secure <br><blockquote><p>"that the number of medical practitioners undertaking to provide general medical services in the areas of different executive councils or different parts of those areas is adequate".</p></blockquote>
The MPCs continue to have the remit to refuse an application on the ground that the number of practitioners in an area, or part of it, is adequate. The Scottish MPC, too, has the power of negative direction. The importance of this cannot be over-estimated because it is crucial to the issue of over-provision of doctors in an area. In a Scottish context also, for reason that I gave earlier, I feel that it would be a shame if the role were downgraded, especially when I reflect on the part of the country that I represent.<br><br>
For Scotland as a whole, while the Scottish MPC has achieved great things over the years, its task is far from complete. There remain two designated areas in Scotland, one in Lanark—the other end of the country from my constituency—and the other in Wick, which is almost at the other end geographically, although more towards my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
end of it—where an additional principal doctor is required. As far as I am aware, there is no equivalent example in England and Wales.<br><br>
There is an important function and role. An additional function of the MPCs is to advise the Secretary of State about whether a rural practice is essential and, if it is, whether, as a result, it attracts an inducement payment.<br><br>
In the highlands and islands, as the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for health can confirm, many communities are dependent on inducement payments to ensure the continuation of medical care. The local GP is an essential part of the fabric of his community. A few years ago, in the town of Applecross—a small community in a remote area of the west coast peninsula and part of my constituency—a vacancy for a general practitioner was expected to occur. There was great anxiety about what might happen if a replacement could not be found. I read recently of similar problems on the island of Eigg. The Minister knows that in such communities the role of giving advice that can trigger eligibility for an inducement payment is most important and should not be lost.<br><br>
Can the Minister say whether the Scottish system will change or whether it will proceed successfully as it has until now? Does his right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and his opposite number at the Scottish Office feel that they will be able, after consulting the committees, to ensure that they are properly briefed on important issues? The Scottish MPC
<br><blockquote><p>"is aware that populations vary in their needs and demands for services depending on social class, degree of social deprivation, regional variations or morbidity, predominant occupation and ethnic background".</p></blockquote>
Those factors are most important to the successful running of a flexible, adaptable, regionally responsive but none the less National Health Service. I hope that the Secretary of State will at least be able to allay fears about the role of the Scottish MPC and its counterpart south of the border, and about their continuing place in the consultative and other procedures of our NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) spoke in broad terms about the functions of the MPCs. However, he missed the basic question, which is whether, in the sort of decision-making process envisaged for the 1990s, we need these anomalous, free-standing unaccountable bodies. It is indefensible that MPCs can take decisions about the allocation of medical resources independently of RHAs, DHAs and FHSAs.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but they can do that because they will allocate the areas within the FHSAs according to whether there are enough GPs. If they decide that an area is open, they automatically allocate a practice to a GP. The committees do not have balanced representation. As the hon. Gentleman said, there are eight members, six of whom are doctors. That is an imbalanced representation.<br><br>
When I was Under-Secretary of State for Health, my instinct, and that of others, was to abolish MPCs because they did not fit into a coherent, decision-making process. Before we ratify the relatively minor changes I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will explain why we need the MPCs. I have the BMA

briefing. What MPCs do does not have to be done by a medical-dominated body. They divide localities within catchment areas into various classifications based on a broad-brush measurement of doctor-patient ratios. That does not have to be done by a doctor. The categories are divided into intermediate, restricted and open. If it is open, they have to let an applicant come forward. What are the skills that can be exercised only by doctors through an MPC? Much of the work would be better done by the FHSAs. They will control the resources and will be responsible for providing primary care in the area. The decisions will be taken away from they by the MPCs and they will be unable to influence them. I do not know whether my right hon. and learned Friend secretly agrees with me or whether he has had this debate in public. I remain to be convinced that such medical dominated, free-standing bodies are needed in the NHS in the 1990s.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). He revealed that there are no deep divisions of policy between us. He sought assurance on aspects of the Government's policy towards the development of general practice, and I think that I can give them, on behalf of the Government and of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
I am grateful, too, to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) for advancing arguments that have occurred to me from time to time over the years. I reassure him that the minor changes will ensure that the existence of the MPCs will not give rise to abuse of their position in future. I do not believe that it does at present.<br><br>
In response to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, the background is reasonably reassuring. Since the NHS began, we have succeeded in expanding the number of GPs in the NHS and, equally importantly, in improving their distribution. We still have some way to go, having regard to the nature of different parts of the country and the difficulties that sometimes exist in attracting doctors either to the most heavily industrialised parts of the country or to the more sparsely populated rural areas.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye gave some good figures relating to the beginning of the NHS in 1948 compared with the present. There has been substantial progress since the Government came to power. Recently, we have been criticised for allegedly threatening an increase in patient list and loss of patient time. In fact, we have made startling progress since 1979. The number of GPs in Great Britain has increased by 4,700, or 18 per cent., to over 30,000 for the first time in the history of the NHS. The population has remained fairly static and the average list size has decreased from 2,229 per practitioner to 1,949: it is below 2,000 for the first time. On average, that is 280 fewer patients per doctor, a 12.5 per cent. fall. The public can therefore expect their doctors to give them more time.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton will agree that MPCs have contributed to those figures by allowing expansion and improving distribution. They have vital tasks that at present are exercised autonomously. There are complaints about individual committees that refuse to approve a new partner for a practice or controversy in deciding how a new practice vacancy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
should be filled. It is true that the MPCs are autonomous, but they have exercised their functions in a reasonable way.<br><br>
I do not contemplate the immediate use of the new powers in clause 20, largely because at the moment I am satisfied with the way in which the MPC for England and Wales, under the chairmanship of Dr. John Ball, is carrying out its functions in the NHS. Nevertheless, it is a long-standing anomaly that the powers and constitution of the MPCs are carefully delineated in primary legislation. At the moment, the Secretary of State has no ability to modify their constitution and no power to issue directions about how they should exercise their judgment. The Secretary of State has that power over every other statutory body in the NHS.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton described the thoughts that crossed his mind when he was a health Minister. I admit that the same thoughts have crossed my mind in the past. A few years ago, there were occasional complaints that the principal objective of MPCs was to ensure that existing practitioners were not exposed to too much competition from newcomers, or that patients were not given an excessive choice, to the embarrassment of existing practitioners. There were especial difficulties in inner-city areas where it was plain that there was a deficiency of good-quality general practice. At the same time, the MPCs declared the areas to be over-doctored and would not allow new practitioners to enter.<br><br>
I recall that they exercised a curious rule that newly-qualified GPs should not be allowed to set up in practice on their own account or in partnership with others, on the basis that they needed more experience in the administration of a practice before they could do so. Medical graduates tend to have been spectacularly able undergraduates. By the time that they qualify as GPs, they have considerable abilities. It struck me as extraordinarily paternalistic to say that some bright young GP in his or her mid or late 20s should be protected from the dangers of going into practice on his or her own account, in competition with a long-established practitioner in the neighbourhood who resisted newcomers. Those thoughts have crossed my mind, but they do not do so at the moment. Since I have been Secretary of State for Health, there have been no examples of abuses of powers by the MPCs and no recent examples of incidents that have caused anxiety. The Bill gives the Secretary of State more powers to direct the committees on the exercise of their functions or to alter their membership.<br><br>
There is an existing power to vary the powers of the MPCs but no power to vary the composition or to make any changes in consequence. I have no particular proposals in mind at the moment to vary their powers but such circumstances might arise.<br><br>
The power to alter their membership will bear some consideration in the not-too-distant future. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton said that at the moment the MPCs consist of a chairman and eight members. Only two of the eight are lay people, the others are doctors. We should question that balance, especially in view of the composition of every other body in the NHS. As the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said, there is an advantage in having a lay input into the service implications for patients of decisions that are taken about changes in practices or their general expansion.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
The changes in clause 20 will introduce more flexibility into the constitutional operations of the MPCs. Parallel provisions have been introduced for Scotland at the behest of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
The debate has revealed no difference of policy between us. No one is objecting to the Secretary of State having the new powers. In fact, my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton has reservations about whether we have gone far enough. I do not believe that anyone will object to the provisions in clauses 20 and 34.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye suggested that we should not be allowed to exercise these dangerous new powers, even if we devised specific proposals for using them, without considerable consultation. Were we to make minor changes in the constitution of MPCs, or give powers of direction on the conduct of meetings, or something of that sort, formal consultation of a statutory sort would really be justified.<br><br>
I see some attraction in amendment No. 617, which provides that we might consult the MPC before issuing any directions. However, it is unusual to consult the body to which we are to give directions before giving it directions. The Secretary of State has powers now to give directions to health authorities and FPCs but he is not subject to any statutory duty to consult. I can think of no strong arguments against the proposal, however, because in practice one would not issue a direction to an MPC without preliminary discussion with the chairman and members on the ground that the Secretary of State was minded to cover. Therefore, I shall give the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye an undertaking to consider the amendment further to decide whether he has a point and we should consult before making changes.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has confirmed that he will give attention to the same point and assume that the computer of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye worked and the relevant amendment was tabled for Scotland.— <i>[Interruption.]</i> Labour Members should not jest about this. They have missed the point and MPCs north and south of the border seem to be a matter of minor concern to them.<br><br>
Given the undertaking that we shall think about the amendment, decide whether there are overwhelming, technical legal or constitutional difficulties in having a duty to consult before giving a power of direction, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye will accept that we are moving in the right direction. If MPCs were to start abusing their position, we shall have powers of direction. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton can be reassured that that will not act against the public interest.<br><br>
For the moment, all is going well. I have no complaints about the present MPCs. We all know that the profession as a whole rather jealously guards its strong influence over the size and location of practices, and admission to general practice, and for the time being I propose to leave well alone and, with the greatest respect, ignore the radical suggestions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton. I hope that clause 20, as drafted will be approved.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for that reply. Before I make my final response to him, I should mention the uncharacteristic, strident outburst from the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). The hon. Gentleman seemed to feel that something was very wrong and should not be allowed to continue. In the Scottish context, however, the potential is not as dreadful as the hon. Gentleman believes. The Scottish figures show that in 1987–88 there were 83 applications to the Scottish MPC. Eight were refused and seven applications were not supported by their own health boards. That shows that the SMPC and, similarly, the MPC south of the border, does not automatically grant applications and consults health authorities and others involved. Therefore, it is not as splendid in its isolation as the hon. Gentleman believes. Perhaps there was bad blood under the bridge when he was last at the Department of Health, but we do not want to hear the inside story.<br><br>
I am pleased to hear that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State for Scotland seem to agree with the principle of building on consultation as proposed in amendment No. 617 and, presumably, thanks to the benefit of superior computer equipment at their disposal, the Government will produce something that is more appropriate later. I welcome that. We have made progress, and I am grateful to the Ministers for the positive way in which they have responded.<br><br>
I find it interesting, however, that the Secretary of State does not see a problem. Is this a chance to grab some more power, which he might as well have for a rainy day when he has nothing to do? The Secretary of State has put a bit more potential power at his disposal for problems he does not see existing and cannot find when he applies his imaginative legalistic mind to the issue. None the less, the right hon. and learned Gentleman wants that power, and it seems as though he will have it. History has been made, pigs can fly and that may have been an ambulance I saw driving across Westminster bridge! As the Secretary of State is accepting the spirit of the amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is of a probing character. I am advised to say that at the outset as the amendment confers specific consultative powers on the Royal College of General Practitioners and there is a real danger that the British Medical Association might never speak to the Labour party again if we press the amendment to a Division. However, a small part of me suggests that it might be worth a try.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
We have tabled the amendment to test why the powers that are set out in the clause are sought. In clause 21 we come to one of the many new powers conferred by the Bill on the Secretary of State. The number of doctors in a locality will not be left to local people to decide. They will not make the big decisions affecting the Health Service, as we were promised, because the clause gives that decision to the Secretary of State sitting in Richmond terrace, who
<br><blockquote><p>"may by order specify the maximum number"</p></blockquote>
of GPs. What does clause 21(1 A) mean? There is confusion about whether the maximum referred to is a maximum for the whole of England or a maximum by specific locality, namely by a particular family practitioner authority or family health authority as they are now to be known? On a narrow reading, the provision must be fair to individual FHAs, but we shall welcome guidance from the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The clause gives powers to the Secretary of State which, until now, were left to the MPCs. It is appropriate for us to have this debate after the exchange between the Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). The Secretary of State explained that the powers in clause 20 will enable him to improve the MPCs, make them more representative and provide for a wider range of skills, not the narrow reliance on skills to which the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) objected.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
It is said that clause 20 will produce brand new reconstituted MPCs that are more in touch with the broad population and not narrowly based on the medical practice. Surely that prompts the following question: why did the Secretary of State give himself the power to refashion the MPCs in the previous clause and, in the subsequent clause, take away the powers hitherto the prerogative of MPCs and give them to himself to impose by order? It is difficult to understand why the Secretary of State needs the powers because he said earlier that he had had no recent complaint against the MPCs. He sounded rather disappointed that there had been no such complaint. Why, therefore, does he need the powers that have hitherto been left to the MPCs to exercise on behalf of the public? If the Secretary of State is to exercise what has hitherto been the prerogative of the MPCs, will he be employing different criteria? Will he use different standards to decide whether an area has sufficient GPs? At present, the MPCs will not usually approve an application for a new practice in an area where the average list size is less than 2,100. Does the Secretary of State have a different —higher—figure in mind? If he does not intend to use criteria different from those currently employed by the MPC, what is the point of clause 21, and why does he take the powers unto himself?<br><br>
My mind is not made easier by reading the note on the clause which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 21 allows the Secretary of State to exercise by order a tighter control".</p></blockquote>
I infer from the phrase "tighter control" that the Secretary of State may be less prone than the MPC to grant an application to form a new practice. It implies only that, in the fullness of time, fewer GPs may be allowed to operate in a given area.<br><br>
We are not guided by the criteria that will guide the right hon. and learned Gentleman. The note on the clause states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"These reserve powers will be used only as and when the Secretary of State considers it necessary."</p></blockquote>
As with clause 20, we are debating a situation which may be triggered in the future. To be able to understand when, why and whether we need worry about this triggering, we need to know the criteria that the Secretary of State would apply to limit the number of GPs.<br><br>
The context in which we consider clause 21 is the recent GP's contract. The central controversy over that contract comes from the fact that, by increasing the capitation element, the new contract provides an increased incentive for longer patient lists. The Secretary of State is familiar with our anxiety that that will result in longer patient lists which, in turn, will mean a worse service for, and less time spent on, patients.<br><br>
We are equally familiar with his response that, arithmetically, it is impossible for the average patient list size to rise as long as there are the same number of patients and GPs. However, clause 21 gives new powers to control the number of GPs in an area in future. Against the background of that new power, the average list size may not necessarily remain the same.<br><br>
We sniff the clause with suspicion. This may be the product of unworthy minds and a lack of trust in the Secretary of State. I hope that he will disabuse us of our suspicion and fear. I invite him to respond to explain why the new powers are necessary, why he does not consider the MPCs adequate to exercise scrutiny and what criteria he is likely to apply in deciding whether it will be necessary to trigger the reserve powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) for describing his amendment as a probing measure. I, too, am sometimes accused of favouring the opinions of the Royal College of General Practitioners rather more than I favour those of the BMA, although I constantly avow neutrality and, when they disagree, my task is to listen to the arguments of each of them. I could not accept an amendment that would give the RCGP a power of veto over the Secretary of State's exercise of powers. I trust that I do not need to argue the point further.<br><br>
I hope, too, that I can allay the suspicions of the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). He is right to consider clauses 20 and 21 together, because they both affect the Secretary of State's ability to intervene in exceptional circumstances in a matter that was previously the entirely autonomous province of the MPCs, unfettered by any real powers of the Secretary of State. I repeat that I have no current complaints, but the hon. Gentleman heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) said about his experience as a health Minister. In the two clauses I seek the Committee's approval for powers which any health Minister, past or future, would regard as welcome additions to the potential armoury of a Secretary of State if ever the planning of medical manpower began to be out of line with what was considered to be the proper development of the service.<br><br>
I do not contemplate using the power in clause 21 in the immediate future. At present, as I explained to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), the Government are reasonably content with the expanding number of GPs, the way that average list sizes are reducing and the continuing improvement in distribution. In certain circumstances, however, it would be useful to have the power set out in clause 21.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
Any Secretary of State needs power to ensure that there is a proper balance of medical manpower throughout the NHS between, for example, the manpower needs of the hospital and community health services on the one hand, and the GP services on the other. Recently, there has been a welcome increase in the number of GPs, but one reason for that is the steadily improving attractiveness of the GP's contract, falling list sizes and the attraction of a career in general practice at a comparatively early age as opposed to the rather more daunting prospects of a junior doctor becoming a consultant.<br><br>
It is conceivable that the balance of attractiveness between the two could become so great that the best manpower would flood into general practice at the expense of the hospital and community health services, with a resultant lowering of the quality and numbers of doctors in the hospital and community health services. Before the hon. Gentleman for Livingston intervenes to say that such matters are within the control of the Government of the day, may I say that I accept that? I realise that it is necessary for us, in conjunction with the profession, to find ways of making the life of a junior doctor more attractive than it is now. We have a joint responsibility for the circumstances that give rise to the problem, and we must endeavour to ease the junior doctor's hours. But in dealing with manpower that is crucial to both the country and the NHS, it is right for the Secretary of State to have more powers than he has had in the past when it is necessary for him to balance the intake into general practice and the hospital and community health services. If, for example, the rate at which doctors exercised their right to go into general practice, subject to the approval of the MPCs were to accelerate remarkably, average list sizes could drop and become unnecessarily low, and there would be a corresponding waste of medical manpower in an overprovision of medical services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about competition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks about competition. There is competition, and we are encouraging it, but the arrangements with the review body, for example, ensure that however many doctors enter general practice and however much the average list size falls, the review body will regard it as its duty to advise the Government to ensure that GPs' average incomes remain satisfactory. If one were to rely on comparisons with the outside world, the result could be an ever increasing number of doctors with an ever declining workload, or with a guaranteed income at quite a high level as they went into general practice.<br><br>
Those are circumstances that might arise but are not likely to arise in the immediate future. Nevertheless, it is wise to give the Secretary of State this reserve power in case general practice were to suck in too high a proportion of trained medical manpower vis-a-vis the rest of the service, or if it were to suck in far more doctors than were conceivably required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be clear about this, because I went through the numbers and the criteria that are currently used by the MPCs. Is the Secretary of State saying that he does not expect to trigger the powers to impose a restriction on the number of GPs, in, say, a certain FHSA area where the average list size has not fallen below 2,100—that being the benchmark at present
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
used by the MPC for intermediate areas in which it would not encourage further applications? Would that be seen as a reasonable benchmark? Or would he consider triggering these powers at some stage at a higher benchmark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about the nature of the power. The power, as proposed, would be exercisable either at national level or at FHSA level, as the Secretary of State wished. At present, there is no benchmark at which I propose to trigger the powers. It is a hypothetical situation in which a Secretary of State might have a reason to set a particular list size or ceiling for the number of practitioners that he wishes to encourage in an area. The benchmarks that are being set by the MPC are not unreasonable, and I propose to see how the situation develops in the light of the new contract and the continuing output of medical schools over the next few years.<br><br>
I can assure the hon. Member for Livingston that the new contract has no particular relevance here, so I hope that I can allay any suspicion on that count. Everyone knows that the hon. Gentleman and I do not agree about the new contract, and both of us are now waiting to see what follows its introduction in April. I was assured by the BMA and other doctors during discussions about the new contract that the terms that I recommended would produce a reduction in the number of GPs and an increase in their average list sizes. I do not believe that. I believe that the argument was based on the false premise that somehow people would seize the opportunity of the new contract to avoid replacing a partner in order to share out the potential practice income among fewer practitioners. Anyone who attempted to do that, increasing the average patient list size in a practice, would run the risk of driving away patients to competitors. Such a move would not succeed. If the BMA's fears were right and the new contract were to result in a reduction of the number of practitioners, the power now being sought would be unnecessary and inappropriate.<br><br>
If, as I believe, the new contract proves attractive and continues to attract go-ahead, hard working GPs who want to develop the nature of general practice, a stage could be reached at which it would be appropriate for a Secretary of State to use the power that we are discussing. We are almost the only country in western Europe or North America that is not over doctored. Most other countries have trained a number of doctors which, in my opinion, is excessive to clinical needs. At present that does not happen in this country, although conceivably it could happen in future. I have no view on that, and I do not believe that the United Kingdom is heading towards being over-doctored. I foresee problems that might arise, however, as a result of a wrong balance developing between general practice and the hospital service, or an imbalance in the number of doctors who want to go to one part of the country as compared with another. In my view, it would be prudent to have the powers in the clause and not to have them fettered by powers of veto given to Royal colleges or other bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am not immediately attracted to the Secretary of State's central argument that he needs the powers to maintain a balance between doctors in the primary sector and doctors in the hospital sector. It may be true that some junior hospital doctors—I have in mind one well known spokesman on behalf of junior hospital doctors—have found it necessary to go into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 743</span>
primary care practice, but surely the way to prevent that is to remove those features that make the junior hospital doctors' life intolerable, instead of making it difficult for them to go into primary care. The prospect of our hospital being partly staffed by those who became hospital doctors because they could not get into general practice, due to clause 21, is not appealing.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's assurance that he does not regard the figures used by MPCs as unreasonable. It is valuable to have that assurance on the record, as we shall hold the Minister to it should he want to trigger clause 21. It would be impolite to press the amendment to a vote for the reasons that I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims<span class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has stated why he would like the powers contained in proposed new subsection (1A). Although he would not necessarily exercise them, circumstances might arise when he would wish to do so.<br><br>
Proposed new subsection (1B) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An order … may contain such … provisions … as appear to the Secretary of State to be appropriate including, in particular, provisions as to the basis on which the Medical Practices Committee are to refuse applications".</p></blockquote>
It is the word "are" that I am querying, as the Act that the clause amends uses the word "may". It would seem that the Secretary of State will have the power to oblige MPCs to refuse applications, whereas MPCs "may" refuse them at present. It would be helpful if my right hon. and learned Friend would clarify that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a valid point. The clause is in two parts, and the first will allow the Secretary of State to set limits by order. Depending on how those limits are set, that may pose problems for an MPC if it suddenly finds itself restricted in the total number of doctors who are allowed to enter into practice. That could give rise to difficulties, and the MPC would expect the Secretary of State to give it a clear instruction as to the basis upon which it should act to come within the Secretary of State's chosen limit. The second new subsection is included so that the Secretary of State can, if necessary, tell the MPC what actions, in his judgment, it needs to take to come within the limit.</span></p>

The amendment is related to the earlier exchanges on MPCs. I have listened to the Secretary of State's assurance in response to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). However, the consensus that the Committee achieved is about to break down, because I am not convinced by the Secretary of State's response. The same goes for amendment No. 620 because it would change the purpose of the clause; it would reduce list sizes to an average of 2,000 patients. As we heard earlier, the purpose of the MPCs is to ensure equity of access to GP services. It is logical, therefore, that restrictions on the upper limit of GP numbers will interfere with that function, and make it more difficult to ensure equity of medical services, especially in rural areas and inner cities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
The Secretary of State earlier assured the Committee that he did not view the clause in that way and did not intend to invoke it for that purpose, and that he wanted to ensure equity of GP availability in the hospital and primary sectors. I take issue with him on that matter, and should like to probe further his ideas about the spread of medical services, and especially about GP numbers. The Government's thinking, expressed earlier by the Secretary of State, is that, at a time when GP numbers are increasing, Britain has done better than other countries in not over-supplying the market, and that we should remain sensibly vigilant. I have recently seen figures, however, that suggest that that is not the whole picture. For example, over the most recent four-year period for which figures are available, the average number of applications for advertised vacancies fell from 43 to 36. Between 1984 and 1988, the number of general vacancies rose from 105 to 145, while the total number of applications fell from 5,465 to 5,152.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that the GP's contract was not relevant to the clause, except in so far as it would induce more people to go into general practice. I think that, because of the impact that it will have, the contract is important in the context of the clause and the amendment. Recent figures show that there are 397 GPs aged over 70 who will retire because of the over-70 rule, and there are a further 658 GPs aged over 65, and 1,947 between the ages of 60 and 64. Several significant issues arise from those figures. The natural progression—I do not like to use the term "natural wastage" in this context—of GPs moving into retirement will ensure vacancies, which will help to absorb the demand. It has been argued strongly in the House that in rural and inner city areas the GP's contract will not be manna from heaven, which the Secretary of State would have us believe. I see an important role for the MPCs in maintaining equity of access in such areas, where many GPs work single-handedly. The Secretary of State is too complacent in claiming that the new contracts will encourage doctors to go into general practice, especially in inner cities and rural areas. To what extent will the total number of GPs who can be appointed in any one year take account of the numbers of GPs who retire? To what extent will the Secretary of State, or someone else in his office of similar political motivation, use that as an opportunity to interfere directly with total GP numbers?<br><br>
My anxieties are legitimate, and it is not enough to say, blithely, as the Secretary of State did earlier, that the contract issue is not relevant to the clause. It is part and parcel of the issue, and I should be grateful if the Secretary of State would respond to those points and to the thrust of my probing amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) described amendment No. 620 as probing, because, as he said, it would completely change the purpose of the clause. He wishes the clause to give the Secretary of State the power to limit the number of practitioners with lists of over 2,000 patients. I can reassure him that in Great Britain the average list size has now fallen below 2,000 for the first time since the NHS was set up in 1948. But there are wide variations and there must continue to be because, in judging what the average list size of a doctor maintaining high standards of practice and fulfilling his terms of service should be, we must take into account the wildly different
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0751">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 745</span>
circumstances of, say, the isle of Eigg, which he cited, and highly populated industrial areas. In scattered rural area and areas of great social deprivation, we expect doctors to have smaller list sizes than doctors in parts of the country where population density is higher and social conditions favourable. There must be considerable room for a doctor to decide how many patients can be handled on his or her list and scope for patients to decide whether they wish to be on the list of an individual doctor.<br><br>
There is a top limit of 3,500 patients for an individual doctor, and 4,500 for a doctor in partnership. But that safeguard looks somewhat old-fashioned and few doctors personally maintain a case-load of that size, even if within a partnership the senior partner has that number nominally on his list.<br><br>
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on the problems in inner cities and in rural areas. He should approve of the parts of the recent contract that deal with those areas because we are introducing a new higher allowance for practices in deprived inner city areas. We have maintained the existing pattern of rural practice allowances, which the profession favours to help rural practitioners. We shall have discussions with the General Medical Services Committee on how the rural practice payment scheme might be changed. As I have made plain before, my aim is to make it more fairly reflect the needs of those who live in sparsely populated areas. The rural practice payment scheme should be aimed at those in scattered areas who cannot attract more patients, rather than reflect the historical pattern of the allowances.<br><br>
There is no great difference, however, between the hon. Gentleman and me. I have described the circumstances in which I see the power being exercised, and I decline to follow him further into his arguments about the contract, with which he continues to be dissatisfied. It will not have the effects that he fears. He mentions a declining number of people applying for practice vacancies. His figure was 35 people applying for every practice vacancy, and there is no sign yet that general practice is unattractive to good quality medical graduates. It can be difficult to get into general practice in desirable parts of the country. If ever there were far more than we required, the powers in the clause could be exercised. I hope that with those reassurances I can persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. He is trying to raise different issues and to get me to exercise powers that no Secretary of State would want to use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State although I fundamentally disagree with his closing remark.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 611, in page 20, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(0) Regulations made under subsection (3) above shall be for the purpose of securing that a sufficient number of dentists practicing in each area undertake a full range of National Health Service work in that area.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 612, in clause 36, page 38, line 12, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(0)Regulations made under subsection (2b) above shall be for the purpose of securing that a sufficient number of dentists practicing in each area undertake a full range of National Health Service work in that area.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are about the information that the British Dental Association will be grateful to receive. I understand, from correspondence between a representative of the BDA and a civil servant at the Department of Health in November 1989, that there were contract negotiations during the summer of 1989 which aimed at agreeing an early retirement scheme for GDPs. That scheme would require changes in the primary legislation that confers on dentists the right to be included on FPC lists. A letter that was sent by the Department to the BDA last November makes that point. It said that on publication of the Bill, clause 22 would give
<br><blockquote><p>"a general power which would enable regulations to be made to limit a dentist's right to be included on a dental list."</p></blockquote>
The clause can be most easily clarified if I quote what the Department went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"When this part of the Bill is debated in Parliament, Ministers will make it clear that they would like to use the power to lay regulations, after the Bill becomes law, to provide a scheme of voluntary early retirement for GDPs, but that this is part of the package of proposals for a new dental contract, and therefore depends on the eventual response of the profession to the package as a whole."</p></blockquote>
I, and those in the BDA who have contacted me, would be grateful for further clarification now on the wider proposals that the Department of Health has in mind. Will the Department, use the provisions to restrict the overall number of dentists?<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State also comment on an additional, related, matter? There is an increasing number of private dentists, especially in city areas. There are about 500 in Britain who operate on a purely private basis. More dentists might enter into private practice in anticipation of the new contracts. As a result the public would have less access to non-private dental care.<br><br>
Is the Secretary of State considering limiting the overall number of dentists, and how far does he expect a greater number of dentists to shift to private practice, in the light of the discussions on the new contracts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman and the British Dental Association, which he has consulted on the matter. First, it has been agreed that the number of people qualifying as dentists should be restricted in future. That is to ensure that there is not eventually an oversupply and waste of the talents of the very able people who enter dental schools. With the agreement of the profession, we have sought to achieve the restriction by reducing the number of people in dental schools in the universities. We have no intention of using that power for the present purpose in the foreseeable future. The clause bears no relationship to the growth of private practice, which I do not particularly wish to encourage, but I am content to leave it to find its own level at the discretion of the dental practitioners concerned.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 747</span>
The only purpose of clauses 32 and 36 which we have in mind is to facilitate the introduction of the early retirement scheme, which is part of the new contract which we negotiated with the BDA, subject to the consent of the profession. We should like the new contract to proceed and the early retirement scheme to be part of it. It is a part of the contract which in our view commends itself very much to the profession.<br><br>
Without clause, an unintended and undesirable side effect could arise from the early retirement scheme. At present, every dental practitioner has a right to have his or her name entered on the dental list of a family practitioner committee, except in cases of obvious disqualification.<br><br>
We are anxious to prevent a dentist being able to take early retirement under the reasonably generous terms proposed under the new contract and shortly thereafter to exercise his or her statutory right to get back on to the dental list of another family practitioner committee. I am sure that it is not an abuse which would occur to many dentists but we should rule it out as a possibility.<br><br>
We intend to introduce regulations to make it clear that someone who has taken early retirement from the NHS will not have the statutory right promptly to apply to go on to another dental list. That is the full intent of the clause. I hope that the amendments are only probing in character because they would stop the regulations being used for that purpose. I do not think that that is the intention behind them. I hope that it is not the BDA's wish to frustrate that aspect of the new contract.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that further clarification. It is not my intention to frustrate the clause, although I hope that he will take on board the fact that judging by the correspondence which I have seen it is thought that the Government will use the clause as an opportunity to introduce regulations at a later date for the wider package that is involved in the overall contract. As the Minister has recently come through the wars with general practitioners over contracts, I hope that he appreciates that it would be better to calm any anxiety building up in the dental profession early rather than having another 15 rounds in public, which may be of innocent amusement to Opposition Members but would do no one any good. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind as the contract discussions continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a bad record of reaching agreement with the representatives of staff which subsequently do not stick. Having had an agreement with the general practitioners which did not stick with their members, and the Whitley council having had an agreement with the ambulance workers' trade union which did not stick with their members, I am hoping for third time lucky with the dentists, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his good wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish the Secretary of State well, but I echo the words earlier of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), that it is always easy to blame the machinery, whether it is hardware or human machinery, and that sometimes it is worth looking in the mirror at the operator. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Why has there not been a linkage of the amendment in this instance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not usual to discuss why something is or is not linked at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have clarified the issue. That was in keeping with the occasional fog of incomprehension which clouds some of the discussion in this Committee.<br><br>
I beg to move amendment No. 613, in page 21, line 2, after 'section', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'and after seeking the consent of the relevant community health council or councils'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment concerns the position of patients and private practice. I do not want to get into an extended debate about the pros and cons of that, and I think that we are all well aware that the Government contend that private practice in this context should be seen as a means of income generation, that the hospitals and health authorities can make a profit from it, and that there is no reason why they should not go down that line.<br><br>
I am not against sensible co-operation between the public and private sectors in principle, providing that private provision is not at the expense of the NHS, in money terms and in terms of the use of facilities and so forth in the NHS. My concern is that there could be expense to NHS patients if the private sector made use of a service or facility which could be in short supply, such as pathology and physiotherapy services. Similarly, staff time could occasionally be spent on private practice rather than being devoted to NHS patients, which would be detrimental to them.<br><br>
There is a role for co-operation between the two sectors, and it is one that I do not oppose absolutely but it is important to highlight at this juncture that expense has an economic and social meaning in terms of the NHS. I hope that the Government will bear that in mind, and bear in mind also that there is anxiety that under the new general management and contract systems financial considerations at local level will be paramount, above the equally, if not more, important social considerations. That is why the amendment seeks to build in consent and, by implication, consultation before consent with the relevant CHCs. In my experience, the CHCs are well placed to give their views on the social costs associated with the interface of private practice and facilities and the NHS.<br><br>
If the emphasis of the new legislation is, as we are told time and again, to make the Health Service more patient and public oriented, surely in this important area it would make much sense to ensure that there was public consultation at local level, so as to make absolutely certain that not necessarily conscious abuses but perhaps unconscious mistaken priorities were not being pursued which would allow the private sector to benefit and make the NHS sector suffer as a result. I hope that the Secretary of State can give us some idea of his thinking on the matter and some reassurance on this extremely important subject.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 749</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of clause 23 is to transfer to local level some of the powers which in the past have been exercisable by the Secretary of State centrally on improving the extension of private health in NHS hospitals. I doubt whether anybody would argue strongly against that. The intention is not to encourage the growth of private sector provision in NHS hospitals in ways that compromise their ability to provide NHS services to patients. If the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) and others do not consider that adequate assurance, the statutory requirement that private patient services should not significantly interfere with NHS provision remains unaffected.<br><br>
We expect DHAs and others to remember the need to ensure, when considering an application for more private practice to be undertaken in a hospital for whose management they are responsible, that the application should not proceed it it would seriously damage the hospital's ability to provide the highest quality NHS provision.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
Long and well-established principles govern the applications to extend private practice. The green book will need to be revised when the Bill is enacted. Revision will remove the duty to consult other private hospitals in the area before extending private practice. It seems illogical to consult competitors about whether to undertake more private practice. Nevertheless, carefully-followed procedures will ensure that proper consultation takes place and that no decision is taken to extend the range of private practice in a manner that might damage the NHS.<br><br>
An extension of private practice would have advantages for NHS hospitals and their authorities in some circumstances. They would include the ability to raise revenue, improved co-operation between private and public sectors—which we consider beneficial to health care generally—and the presence of consultants a great part whose private practice is on the premises of NHS hospitals with which they had a contract. That would prevent consultants vanishing each time they had to attend a private patient, as often happens. I hope that no hon. Member would wish to prevent the proper expansion of private patient facilities in directly-managed NHS hospitals where that is sensible. The green book requires DHAs to consult professional advisory machinery, hospital staff interests, CHAs, FPCs and other interested health authorities. I anticipate that that will largely continue.<br><br>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye would give the local community health council or councils affected a power of veto over an application. While I have great respect for some CHAs —the best act as a worthwhile patients' voice in the service —it is going a bit far to give them an absolute right of veto so that nothing can happen without their consent. I do not think that such absolute power is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Secretary of State's response. May I clarify one point? The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that he would take it as assumed that there would be local consultation on private sector involvement. Does he anticipate part of that consultation including CHAs in most cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 263, in page 21, line 5, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'subject to annual review by the Secretary of State'.</p></blockquote>
Notwithstanding the content of the green book, and without seeking a veto on the arrangements of DHAs, I submit that this is an important amendment that would curtail the use of NHS beds for private work. Subsection (2)(a) gives DHAs or special health authorities power to
<br><blockquote><p>"make available at a hospital or hospitals for which they have responsibility accommodation and services". We want that power to be reviewed annually by the Secretary of State.</p></blockquote>
The Government could argue that under the proposed new subsection (1A), DHAs or SHAs are required to
<br><blockquote><p> "consult organisations and representatives of the interests of persons likely to be affected"</p></blockquote>
and might say that that provides an element of local accountability. My hon. Friends and I say that that is not enough. We must examine the motives of health authority managers under the new climate. I draw the Committee's attention to an article in the Newcastle newspaper, The Journal of 8 January 1990 headed "Cut-price private health care for North." It states:
<br><blockquote><p> "Newcastle's Freeman Hospital will be able to carry out routine operations at prices hundreds of pounds lower than its private rivals after it opts out of local health authority control, according to unit general manager Mr. Len Fenwick.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Mr. Fenwick said the Freeman could use its spare capacity for private work, to generate income and reduce the cost of treatment, without the quality of care to NHS patients suffering.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Waiting lists could even be cut as a result of the additional funds generated by private work".</p></blockquote>
That, to me, implies queue jumping. Mr. Fenwick continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It will help us focus on where the greatest need is, and where waiting lists are. Any 'profit' we make will be channelled back into the service", said Mr. Fenwick.</p></blockquote>
Mr. Fenwick was right in his view of how things will develop in future. In NHS hospitals, whether opted-out or directly managed, emphasis will be placed on maximising private patient arrangements despite the Ministers assurances which he drew from the green book.<br><br>
We must try to understand the attitudes of consultants. They will want the work. There have been articles in The Sunday Times in recent weeks and I understand that Mr. Nichol has announced that there will be an inquiry into allegations in the newspaper's Inside article and into other information which I understand The Sunday Times will be able to provide for him about cases, which because of pressure on space, it was unable to publish eight days ago.<br><br>
There is also evidence that was given to the Public Accounts Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), who drew attention to a recently-received document that had been circulated to general practitioners in his constituency. My hon. Friends will be interested to hear what the document revealed. It listed facilities for out-patients by 87 consultants at a large private hospital in Birmingham. Of the 87, some were regarded as full-time NHS consultants but the rest were working on maximum part-time consultancies for the Health Service. However, they had regular out-patient sessions at scheduled times during working hours between Monday and Friday at the private hospital in question. Seventy-four of them had regular planned sessions. They were taking planned time off
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0754">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
during working hours from Monday to Friday even though they were maximum part-time or full-time NHS consultants.<br><br>
That shows major abuse, but, more than anything, it highlights what goes on in consultants' minds when faced with the prospect of how to raise their income in conditions in which they might claim that NHS remuneration is insufficient. I am sure that most of them work from the most altruistic of motives, but a large proportion—almost 90 per cent.—of a group of consultants in Birmingham were, to some extent, in breach of their contractual arrangements with the DHA. Evidence given in The Sunday Times, the National Audit Office report and in data produced by my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill shows that if beds in HHS hospitals are available for private use, doctors and consultants will use them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little short of time. We can discuss the matter later in the Bill.<br><br>
Some consultants will juggle their time because they are under pressure to do private work to earn more. The NAO report stated that the
<br><blockquote><p>"research concluded that private sector activity may have reached an upper limit in the short-term and may be unable to increase further 'without any NHS consultants either doing more work outside the normal working week or … without many full-time consultants switching to part-time work and thereby reducing the NHS caseload'.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>These findings suggest that a further increase in private health care, either inside or outside the NHS, will increase the conflict of commitments unless there is a significant increase in the number of NHS consultants or a change in the types of contract they hold."</p></blockquote>
There is a fixed number of consultants nationally. I estimate that there are 15,865, including 1,750 who work as specialists exclusively in the independent sector. About 14,000 who work within the NHS equally spend time within the private sector. There is a constant number of consultants doing a given amount of work nationally. That number was marginally increased this year by an additional 100 recently announced by the Secretary of State. What proportion of their work do consultants allocate to the NHS and what proportion to the private sector? My hon. Friends believe that a greater proportion of their time should be allocated to the NHS. I want consultants to keep to their NHS duties during their contracted sessions. The new contract may meet that objective although I am not altogether convinced that it will.<br><br>
We need far more than the 100 new consultants announced by the Secretary of State. The problem is that more than the remuneration of the consultant is at issue. Additional supporting staff and extra theatres will be required. The cost to the NHS of employing an additional consultant has been estimated at as much as £250,000 a year, if the additional charges are taken into account. That may be an exaggeration. Perhaps the Minister will comment on the figure when he replies.<br><br>
The NHS should renegotiate contracts so that consultants who have extra time available use it to deal with NHS patient lists. The contract may have to be negotiated as the NAO report on the NHS and independent hospitals suggested.<br><br>
We do not want consultants to scurry off to do their private work in private hospitals or on private wards in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
NHS hospitals. We want to ensure that if consultants have time available it-is spent, whenever possible, in compliance with the new contracts, or renegotiated contracts, in NHS time, NHS remunerated, on NHS wards and in NHS hospitals.<br><br>
The amendment requires hospitals to review private bed provision in NHS hospitals annually and to give that information to the Secretary of State. At least greater consideration will then be given to decisions for providing additional private health places in NHS hospitals than that given by immediate DHAs and those they consult.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that more consultants are required in the NHS. The Government are committed to an annual increase of at least 2 per cent. I am glad to say that in the last year for which we have full figures we have achieved an increase of 2.9 per cent. The 100 additional consultants that are connected with the NHS review are intended to be over and above that commitment to 2 per cent. growth.<br><br>
We seek particularly to solve the problem for consultants in specialties where, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, large expenses can be incurred, quite beyond the consultant's salary, for theatre time, back-up staff and so on, to enable the consultant to do his work. The most expensive specialty tends to be general surgery. We estimate that the appointment of an additional consultant to an NHS hospital can involve a total increase of anything up to £500,000. The implementation of our 100 extra consultants' policy enables us to provide up to that amount in a particular case if that proves to be necessary.<br><br>
I see no objection in principle, and I am not sure that the hon. Member for Workington did in his speech, to a NHS consultant also having a reasonable amount of private practice in his own time if that is how he wishes to practice medicine. Indeed, there are considerable advantages in that arrangement. It enables us to keep in the NHS some of the finest medical brains in the world who will win contracts for the NHS while they can earn for themselves from private practice.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Workington that a consultant who has a contract with the NHS should first carry out his full obligations to the NHS. It is up to management to ensure that the consultant is carrying out his contractual obligations, and steps should be taken against consultants who do not. I am satisfied that most consultants do more than is required by contractual obligations imposed upon them by the NHS. Fortunately, for patients, the typical consultant is fairly workaholic.<br><br>
I welcome Duncan Nichol's inquiries into the recent allegations in newspapers and I trust that steps will be taken to stop any abuse, if that is what his inquiry finds.<br><br>
What has not been appreciated from recent comments is the effect that NHS reforms will have on ensuring that consultants carry out their contractual commitments and the extent to which reforms will reduce the scope of possible abuse. First, DHAs will have more power over the consultant's contract of employment. The contract will still be held at district level but the DHA, as the region's agent, will annually review the consultant's job description and agree the form that the consultant's commitment to his contract will take.<br><br>
Over and beyond that, the contract system will also ensure that each clinical unit has an expressed workload,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0755">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
and resources will go to that unit only when it has delivered its NHS workload. Once more, if any consultant is among that rare minority who might be tempted to abandon the work of his NHS unit to undertake excessive amounts of private practice, there will be repercussions under the contract arrangements for that unit.<br><br>
For example, I contemplate that when districts enter into contracts with hospitals for the work of a clinical unit, among the terms and conditions that they might stipulate as part of the quality terms of the contract is that every patient referred by a GP to a consultant for a second opinion is entitled to expect that consultant to see him at least once on the first out patient visit, which is not always done in the NHS now. Our reforms will help considerably.<br><br>
The clause and the amendment deal with whether private practice facilities should be allowed to grow in NHS hospitals. In a sense, this is only tangential to the main points made by the hon. Member for Workington. I said in our previous debate that it is an advantage to have private patient facilities in a NHS hospital wherever feasible. The scope for abuse is less if the private practice is on the same premises and consultants will not vanish to a private hospital either nearby or elsewhere. Leaving that on one side, I hope that I can meet the main concerns of the hon. Member for Workington by saying that although the powers will be transferred to district level, the principles that we now apply to the co-existence of private practice with Health Service work will continue.<br><br>
I referred to the green book, which will require some revision. The green book is based on six principles of conduct to which the Government remain committed. We have agreed them with the profession and they will not be changed in any revision of the green book.<br><br>
I shall briefly remind the Committee of those six principles. First, the provision of private patient facilities does not significantly prejudice non-paying patients. Secondly, subject to clinical considerations, early—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley<span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, how will that affect the current position in the South Manchester health authority? A ward was closed, despite patient demand from non-paying patients, because of financial crises. Subsequently, a loan was made from the budget to make that a private ward. From the money brought in by private patients the loan will be repaid and any extra money will go towards opening another ward. Therefore, private patients will get ahead of non-paying patients in south Manchester. Is that the model the Secretary of State is supporting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, I shall require far more detail than that to answer the hon. Gentleman's point. My experience of the South Manchester DHA is that it continually gets itself into financial crises. However, a lot of local publicity about ward closures and so on is not necessarily linked to reductions in patient services. The authority's financial crises are by no means as straightforward as they are made to appear. That particular district is quite generously financed. I am glad to say that it is taking steps to improve the management of its affairs and the arrangement of its services. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to engage in a detailed argument about a ward in south Manchester, he will have to correspond with either me or one of my colleagues.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
I shall now return to the six principles in the green book. Secondly, subject to clinical considerations, earlier private consultation should not lead to earlier NHS admission. Thirdly, a common waiting list should be used for urgent or seriously ill patients. Fourthly, after admission, access to diagnostic and treatment facilities is governed by clinical considerations. Fifthly, standards of clinical care and services are the same for all patients and, sixthly, single rooms are not held vacant for potential private patients.<br><br>
The principles are agreed between the Government and the profession and I do not believe that any member of the Committee will argue with them. The principles will be embodied in the guidance given to DHAs in the exercise of powers under the clause.<br><br>
In those circumstances, an annual review by the Secretary of State, which is the point of the amendment, would not add much. I take it that the hon. Member for Workington is not objecting to transferring to local level the powers previously exercised centrally, and if that is done I am not sure what an annual review would achieve.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington expressed his anxieties about the relationship between private practice and NHS work. I hope that I have reassured him and that he will not press his amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State sought to reassure us on the basis of a green book, which needs revising, which is in the possession of health authorities. The green book does not work in the way in which the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggests. I presume that there will be a Department of Health inquiry into what is happening in Birmingham, where as many as 90 per cent. may have been in breach of their contracts.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that the principles set out in the green book will be embodied in guidance notes. Once again, there is to be a voluntary arrangement. Health authorities will ask their consultants to comply with a document that prior to amendment they ignored on occasions—in some parts of the country on many occasions. I do not argue with the principles in the green book, but they cannot be enforced as the hon. Gentleman suggests, despite the fact that the new contractual arrangements for consultants will require them to provide more detail about their weekly activities. Consultants should be more accountable and for that reason I shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
