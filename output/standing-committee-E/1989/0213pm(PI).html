	<div class='clause'>Clause 39</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CHARGES FOR ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 250, in page 40, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) Persons who are provided by local authorities with accommodation under Part III of that Act shall, where they meet the financial criteria prescribed by the Secretary of State, be eligible for Income Support and Housing Benefit in the same manner as if accommodated in a Residential Care Home registered under Part II of the Registered Homes Act.'.— [Mr. Robin Cook.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are discussing also amendment No. 251, in page 40, line 44, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'except that persons who are provided with such accommodation shall, where they meet the financial criteria prescribed by the Secretary of State, be eligible for Income Support and Housing Benefit in the same manner as if accommodated in a Residential Care Home registered under Part II of the Registered Homes Act 1984.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are about three things which it is difficult to conceive of the Minister speaking or voting against: equality of treatment, fairness and reasonableness. There is little more to them than those simple principles. But I have been puzzled at how Ministers have been wriggling when asked about the different ways in which different people will be treated under this legislation. I asked the Secretary of State for Wales in a written question a few days ago to tell me
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether he will make it his policy that Government contributions to support people living in homes for the elderly in Wales shall be calculated on the same basis, irrespective of whether the home is run by a local authority, a voluntary or charitable body, or on a private commercial basis."</p></blockquote>
That would follow one simple principle, which we debated and which the Government tried to persuade us was enshrined in earlier parts of the Bill: that the money follows the person or that the money follows the patient. The response from the Under-Secretary was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our policies for the future funding of care in the community are fully set out in the White Paper 'Caring for People: Community Care in the Next Decade and Beyond' Cm 849." —[Official Report, 9 February 1990; Vol. 166 c.812]</p></blockquote>
That was hardly a revealing or generous response to a simple question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same question put to the Secretary of State for Health elicited a rather different answer. I had put the question to the Secretary of State for Social Security and I am still waiting for him to explain why he transferred it to the Secretary of State for Health. A principle is
	<span class='label label-info column'>894</span>
apparently being undermined here: that the individual is the recipient of benefit. A distortion is being introduced, which is reflected by the fact that two Secretaries of State are passing the buck between them. The question that I asked was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether he will make it his policy to ensure that elderly people resident in homes for the elderly are provided equivalent support from public funds irrespective of whether the homes are publicly or privately run."</p></blockquote>—
The Under-Secretary of State for Health was more open than the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. After referring to the White Paper, he wrote:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under our community care proposals local authorities will have to contribute more to the support of people in homes under their own management than to that of people in private homes but the personal financial position of residents will be same." —[Official Report, 31 January 1990; Vol. 166 c.231.] </p></blockquote>
In other words, because local authority care is often cheaper and more efficient than the private sector, the latter will be subsidised by the Government at the expense of the local authority. That seems to contradict the Government's idea of the money following the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presumed that the proposal had been reasoned logically. I thought that if I asked for the reasons, I would be given them. So on 12 February I asked the Secretary of State for Health:
	<br><blockquote><p>"what are the reasons why Government contributions to support people living in homes for the elderly are not to be calculated on the same basis, irrespective of whether the home is publicly or privately run."</p></blockquote>
I hope that in reply to this debate the Minister for Health will give us the answer, because to a basic question which relates to legislation that has supposedly been thought through by the Government before being brought before the House, the Minister answered:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall let the hon. Member have a reply as soon as possible."</p></blockquote>
The timing was generous, bearing in mind the way in which questions are answered in the House. There was plenty of time. The Minister's answers mean that she does not know and that there is no reasonable explanation for the Government's tipping of the playing field, which is what the amendments seek to target. The unworthy thought crosses my mind that the Minister really meant, "I do not wish to answer until the Committee has moved past this point in the Bill because I realise how outrageously unfair my answer will seem." Perhaps the Minister will give a firm answer today. Either way, her response was appalling, unfair and unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are fining local authorities for doing what they and she want local authorities to do. The Government want them to provide this sort of residential accommodation. The White Paper stated that and it has been stated in Committee. Why, then, as my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said undermine the position of local authorities and impose on them the option of closing homes to save money and balance the unfairness? Local authorities will merely be following the financial logic that the Government have tried to persuade us is the only logic to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a basic inconsistency in the Government urging local authorities to make the provision and work in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors while, at the same time, tilting the balance outrageously against the public sector and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister reiterated that the Government will expect local authorities to retain the ability to act as direct providers. It was suggested that this was of direct
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>895</span>
importance to services for people with high dependency or especially challenging behaviour whose care it is essential to safeguard. If the Minister is willing to confirm that the Government mean that, she should make the financial provision fit the requirement and not depend on rhetoric. The financial logic had to fit the Government's plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A deliberate shift of services into the community is required if people are to be assisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston said that, often, services for the elderly are focused on homes for the elderly. My own authority, South Glamorgan county council has acted in this way. It decided that a range of services such as home help provision was needed for the elderly, and that many such services are needed by the elderly who still live in their own homes. The council has based the resources in the community in the one place where high quality services are already provided—in homes for the elderly—instead of in remote county headquarters. It makes sense and has logic. The approach that the Government have adopted is dangerously likely to undermine the sort of commonsense strategy for care in the community, which is what the Government claim their Bill promotes. That unfairness also places an additional burden on poll tax payers. Elderly people share the burden of poll tax so, at some time, they will share the burden that is being placed on local authorities and shrugged off by the Government, a burden that, up to now, has been a national responsibility. It is grossly unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his original report, Sir Roy Griffiths emphasised the need for improved consumer choice. The Bill as drafted will reduce choice for old people by pressuring local authorities to use private residential homes that are more expensive and on average less efficient than those in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During a debate last week, both sides of the Committee referred to occasional failings in both the public and the private sectors. My hon. Friends said that they did not like failings whatever sector they were in, and that all such failings should be tackled. However, we ought to point to the benefits as well. I have had experience in my constituency, and in neighbouring ones, of excellent standards of care in public sector homes for the elderly. I pay tribute to their dedicated staff and their positive atmosphere, in which elderly people are encouraged to take a full part in the life of their communities for as long as they can. They are encouraged to continue developing in their old age, and not to see their old age as something negative, just to be survived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is important in a community-based philosophy, as is the idea that homes for the elderly should be drawn into the life of the community around them. That can work in a positive way, and does so best in the local authority setting where such contact is encouraged by professional and voluntary workers, and by local voluntary organisations. I appeal to the Minister to give a—preferably brief —answer, and to admit that the logic of the Opposition's case is so modest and sensible that she will accept the amendments and so restore some common sense to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must express my ignorance on these maters, because I simply do not understand how the financial mechanisms will work. I had a conversation before lunch with a person who had an
	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>
excellent knowledge of such matters, but whom I am not in a position to name during the Committee's proceedings. Our conversation ended with my formulating the view that even that person, who should have understood these matters well in the circumstances, did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear about the extent to which there is a level playing field for housing benefits, local authority contributions and social security payments. The Minister should circulate a chart to Committee members—a chart that is different from chart 7 at the back of the "Caring for People" White Paper, which sets out the way in which each sector will be funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new chart should clarify the situation completely, especially with regard to the way in which social security benefits will be aggregated and paid to local authorities to fund local authority provision. The chart should also set out the position on housing benefit and show where arrangements are likely to exist for social services authorities to make contributions to top-up payments to various schemes. We could then assess the scheme far more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Varying interpretations of the scheme have been given by Ministers, and I have seen parliamentary replies, such as those produced by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), which appear to contradict each other. I have heard social security Ministers at the Dispatch Box making statements that seem to be at variance with what Ministers from the Department of Health have said. I am not even convinced that Ministers in the Department of Health have taken a consistent line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Health would do well to read her brief to the Committee; I hope that she has one today, so that we can understand her. She might even produce the chart that I have mentioned, which Committee Members should be given before the Committee's next sitting, so that we can see how the payments will be made to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak in support of the amendments. As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said, clause 39 is the ideological part of the Bill. It is a direct attempt to wipe out public sector residential care provision. That is the clear aim; there is no other motivation for it. It contains blatant financial discrimination against local authority, directly provided, part III accommodation, and it will be virtually impossible for local councils to continue the direct provision of residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) has not taken much part in our proceedings today, although he is normally quite active. He and the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) were carrying out a refuse collection service earlier today, getting rid of waste paper. But when he said last week that one of the Bill's aims was to improve the quality of public sector care, I challenged him to justify his argument, in the face of clear financial discrimination against local authorities that wish to do that. Local authority homes in my area, as in other areas, need more money, but less money will be available as a result of the clause, and local authorities will have to dispose of their public sector care. So how can the hon. Member for Gillingham argue that one of the Bill's aims is to improve public sector care? I shall be happy to give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>897</span>
way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes to justify his statement, but I see that he does not want to intervene at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 39 undermines any claim that the Government are trying to help local authorities improve their directly provided care. The opposite is true. The clause means the end of local authority residential accommodation, and that will have a direct effect on the lives of the many people who rely on it. Over the years, vast numbers of people have come to appreciate the fact that the Labour Government passed the National Assistance Act 1948, which brought about that form of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston and others have said, the local authority home, unlike the private sector institution, is genuinely part and parcel of the community. Homes that have been set up by local authorities have been built where people live—not 20 or 30 miles away in the middle of the countryside, in a Victorian mansion no longer needed by a rich family. Homes that are provided in the community not only take people into care when needed, but they offer a community facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government tell us that the Bill will provide more choice, but I look at what it will mean in my constituency. It will mean distinctly less choice for vast numbers of elderly people who choose not to go into the private sector. Because of the lack of local provision, many of my constituents have to go outside my constituency, outside my metropolitan district. They cannot find accommodation when they need it—usually on discharge from hospital —in the Wakefield district. In a number of cases, people have been placed in private homes, particularly in Kirklees, sometimes in Bradford, and after they have been there for six weeks or longer, they have difficulty, not in persuading Wakefield council to offer them directly provided accommodation, but in persuading the local authority to accept the financial responsibility for placing the people back in their own areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter that worries me greatly. Many of the people who have lived all their lives in Wakefield have to spend their remaining months and years miles away from their families and the community in which they want to spend the rest of their lives. What they are offered is not community care; it is anything but community care, and the Government seem quite content with the system that they have pioneered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud of some of the homes that my local authority have provided—Waterson house, Queen Elizabeth house, Flanshaw lodge, Honley house, Castle Grove, Walton house and a number of others. They have given first-class care, and they are based in the community —not miles away, but where people live and where families and friends can visit. I am not talking about places that are 20 or 30 miles away, where people are forgotten and left to die. It worries me that those homes will no longer exist once the Bill is enacted. I am worried about the clear financial discrimination against the Wakefield district council if it attempts to continue to maintain them. That is the problem that the amendment seeks to tackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston mentioned a number of the options that are open to local authorities. One is to close or reduce the number of directly provided homes. But how can local authorities fulfil their obligations to accommodate dependent elderly or handicapped people when they no longer have the direct ability to do so, and when the private sector will not accept such people? Another option is to sell off to other
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>
providers, as happened in Bradford. Those of us who live in west Yorkshire do not have far to go to see examples of the extremism of the Conservative party; we see the human consequences in Bradford, where elderly ladies, lifelong Tory voters, have gone to court because the homes in which they lived are being sold over their heads. The same will happen elsewhere, not just in extremist Bradford, when reasonable and sane local authorities are forced to take similar action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned two options. There is one other. Clause 51 allows some differences in the financial arrangements for certain people in local authority accommodation, but some local authorities may wish to cream off people who are assessed as needing residential accommodation and who have resources. They will place them in directly provided local authority homes, and put the people who qualify for income support and housing benefit into the private sector. A person will be assessed as needing residential accommodation. Then there will be a second assessment, based on the person's finances, and because of the discrimination that exists with directly provided local authority accommodation, the local authority will see the person who has £30,000 or £40,000, or a house, as a full-cost payer under the arrangements for local authority residential accommodation. The person will be means-tested, pay the full cost, and go into the directly provided local authority home, while the person who is not wealthy and has no house to dispose of will go into the private sector because she qualifies for income support and housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that happening. Local authorities that want to keep their own local authority homes will take that option, because they know that many people choose to go into local authority homes in their own areas. The local authorities that want to continue to provide those homes will have to suck into them people who have money, who will be assessed at full cost and charged the full cost of the care that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Minister to refute the assertion that the clause will make that example possible. It will happen in some areas. It worries me that a community asset will be accorded only to people who have resources. Those who have not will go the way of the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not out to knock the private sector. I have been to small private sector homes which offer good standards of care. I spent part of a day during the recess at one with 20 residents in Horbury, at the request of the owner, who knew that I would make some critical comments about private care. I was impressed with the standard of care there. But in my opinion that the private sector is not suited to provide residential care on its own, as the Government envisage, was reinforced because the owner said that she was of retirement age and was therefore contemplating selling the home. When I had complimented her on the homeliness of the home she said, "Yes, but when I sell it it will be picked up by a larger organisation which will immediately double, treble or even quadruple the number of beds." That is happening in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a home in the Wakefield district with 100 beds. When I started as a social worker we discussed trying to reduce home sizes to 35 beds. We are returning to massive institutions because that is the way to make money—the way to make a killing out of the need for care of vulnerable individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is far more important than simply bandying about examples to win party points. I have seen abuses of people in the public sector and in the private sector. The important issue is the abuse of old people, and the circumstances in which that occurs. The hon. Member should address the fact that the private sector can choose whom it takes in. Conservative Members seem not to accept that. On average the clients in private sector care are far more able than those who end up in the local authority sector, where the staff cannot choose who enters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have pondered the demands made on the caring people in the public sector. I can understand why the tolerance of people who would not normally abuse people snaps because of the stresses and strains to which they are subjected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman had a bang on the head last week. He may not have understood what I said, which was that I can understand the circumstances that lead to such cases as the one referred to by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). I understand the stresses that staff are placed under day in and day out when trying to deal with the most dependent and difficult people, who are left to the public sector and who are chucked out by the private sector. I am not condoning abuse in any way. I think that the hon. Gentleman is aware that I did not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should treat such issues seriously and not argue whether abuse occurs in the public or private sector, or whether there is an abuse in Nye Bevan Lodge or in the hundreds of examples of private homes that the Opposition could churn out. My motivation for supporting the amendments is not ideological, it is based on sound practical reasoning, which I hope to advance in serious debate.

My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston made an important point when he compared the role of a local authority home to that of an equivalent private home in the same area. He said—and this has been reinforced by subsequent speakers—that local authority homes in many areas were genuine community resources, not simply institutional provisions. We should encourage that development; yet the Bill will kill it off. We should improve support, as some areas have, so that people can remain longer in their own homes and, when they move to residential care, stay in their own areas. Some homes in my constituency are surrounded by sheltered housing units, so that residents can move from sheltered accommodation to residential care while staying within their community. My

mother moved from her sheltered accommodation to a residential home only 50 yd away. I should like to see more such developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the homes with which I have dealings provide day care, respite care, and such one-off caring provision as giving a bath to someone who does not have the facilities at home, or lacks the motivation, or needs assistance. Such people can go to part HI accommodation for the care that they cannot get within the community. I know of no such examples in the private sector, which is not interested not in preventive provision but in encouraging people into institutional care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During a debate in the House the previous Minister for Health, the hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), accepted that a woman of 60 or a man of 65, who lacked capital resources, could get income support from the DSS and enter a private home, even if he or she were as fit as a fiddle. The proprietors of private homes will be happy to receive such residents because if their residents are fit their homes will need fewer staff and less resource commitment to care. The Government's organisation of that aspect of care is a shambles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many—though not enough—local authority homes are geared to rehabilitation. It is unhealthy to view residential homes as the end of the road for the residents. As a nation, however, we have become bogged down by institutions. We are anchored to the concept of the workhouse, which provided the idea of residential care and the original example of it. Part III accommodation has followed that example. We must escape such concepts, and look at new forms of provision. The private sector will not do that because, it is interested in making money, and not in innovating or finding options to institutional care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Ann Widdecombe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidstone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of our debates last Thursday and this morning, the hon. Gentleman's remarks are amazing. He made the sweeping statement that the private sector is in it for the money. Does not he accept that many private homes look after many Florence Smiths at a loss, and that they do so because they perceive it as their duty? He said that we should move away from institutional care. Does not he accept that that is the basis of the Government's policy of care in the community? Should not the Opposition therefore support, rather than decry, that policy? Has not the hon. Gentleman made precisely the sweeping statements that he has accused Conservative Members of making?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had difficulty hearing the hon, Lady's final point. I listened carefully to her contribution to the debate last week, and I fully understand, as I think the hon. Lady appreciates, what Florence Smith's case illustrates. During that debate, I said that proprietors and managers from the private sector had told me that they were subsidising some of their residents. I concede that. But if they were subsidising the majority of their residents, and were no longer making a profit, their business would fail. The purpose of a business is to make a profit. The private sector does not offer forms of care and support that keep people out of institutional care. That is why it is inappropriate for care for dependent people to be based on a business model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The caring services should be re-oriented so that people are kept out of institutions. More than £1 billion a year is spent on income support. Those resources that are sunk into institutional care should be used to keep people in the

	<span class='label label-info column'>901</span>
community. I have written to Ministers with examples of people who could be in their own homes costing less to the state than it costs ot keep them in private homes where they do not want to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of what the hon. Gentleman says is incontrovertible. The Bill creates a structure of assessment and care management. Its purpose is to avoid the perverse incentive that the hon. Gentleman reasonably excoriates under the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman intervened in my speech last Thursday with a similar remark. My response, which he can read in Hansard, was that assessment is based on what is available to the social worker in the community. My argument is that if there are no support services in the community to help keep people in their own homes they end up in institutional care, even though with the appropriate support they could stay in their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accuse the Government not of underfunding but of misuse of funds. The £1 billion a year spent on income support could be used in other ways. Young handicapped people could remain at home with their wives and husbands if the support were there, but it has been cut by the Government's policies. They have made the situation worse. There is no real community care available now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority homes are often geared to rehabilitation, as they should be. In some circumstances, it is unrealistic to consider returning people to their own homes, but every individual has certain capacities which should be encouraged. My grumble about the institutional model is that it tends to discourage people and lead to their becoming dependent. It encourages people to think, "Well, I'm in a home now, I'll be looked after and that's it." In some cases, people give up. I have seen people whom I reckon could have survived in the community for two or three years who have gone into a home and in a matter of weeks they have died. They ceased to have any motivation for life. They gave up, accepted their circumstances and felt that they were finished. There must be a different model to ensure that residential care is geared to rehabilitation. Residential care should not be an end in itself, where people are kept indefinitely. People should be encouraged to go back to independent living in the community. The private sector will not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad fact is that local authority homes are often the only establishments that will accept certain people. In the case of a member of my family and in numerous constituency cases, the private sector did not want to know because the person wet or messed the bed, wandered about, or did other antisocial things in front of councillors who visited the home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Government if they had any proposals to change the provisions of the National Assistance Act 1948. Under part III of that Act, local authorities are required to care for vulnerable or handicapped people. I understand that the Government have no plans to change the provisions. I want to know now local authorities will be able to fulfil their requirements under that Act if they no longer have the ability to provide care. How will they remain within the law if it is financially impossible for them to provide direct, part III residential accommodation? The Bill will remove the safety net but local authorities will still have a duty under the Act. The Government cannot have it both ways. They must either
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
withdraw the duty and leave people to fend for themselves —the Government seem to be happy with such a laissez-faire model—or withdraw the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman admitted earlier that some private homes provided a good service. In reply to my intervention, however, he refused to admit that private and public homes were on a par in terms of abuses. The hon. Gentleman appeared to argue that because private homes are based on the profit principle, they necessarily depend on exploitation and creating a system of dependents. That is an old-fashioned patrician attitude. It does not accord with the modern view that private enterprise is often better at delivering what the consumer desires and needs. The Labour party increasingly accepts that view of other issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is embroiled with the business model, and here I have difficulty in making him understand that it is inappropriate to caring. The hon. Gentleman argued that private standards of care are superior in some instances. I am anxious that if an individual in a private home requires more care than the staff can provide, that individual will be asked to move to somewhere more appropriate. The home will say that it is not prepared to increase the staff because the patient's needs are beyond what it is prepared to give. If the person is give more care but the fees cannot be increased, the proprietor makes less money. The result will be that the vulnerable person who needs more care will be asked to move on, usually to the public sector. Those qualifications do not operate in the public sector, which has to deal with those people whom everyone else rejects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 39 does not put the political boot only into the public sector. It puts the boot into the most vulnerable people in society, and we should be ashamed of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To understand what lies behind the amendments, I refer briefly to our discussions on clause 37. The local authorities fear that they will be handed a chalice which, even if it is not intentionally poisoned, will become poisoned. They will be faced with new, exciting, challenging and demanding responsibilities without the resources available to meet those responsibilities. That fear underpins the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ministerial team's discussions of clause 37 did not go far towards allaying those anxieties, but we hope for something in that respect. Ministers could accept the spirit, if not the word of the amendment. They could guarantee to local authorities a base-line, specific commitment to local authority residential care through the income support and housing benefit systems. They could make a financial allocation that would reflect the level of income support and housing benefit if they were applied. Local authorities would thus feel much more calm about their responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should bear in mind that it is those local authorities which provide the best, most professional standards of care. They are also the most expensive. Expense and good output are not always synonymous but there is a close connection between increasing expense and the quality of provision. Local authorities which provide high standards of care with high expenditure have the greatest anxiety about how they will stand in the new system.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being good, sound professionals, they cannot accept that they should operate a system that will produce systemic descrepancies between different parts of their arrangement, but that will happen because of differences in funding. By accepting the spirit of the amendments, the Minister would assure local authorities that are in the position that I have described that there would be sound, reliable, predictable support, and that when they tried to predict how they would stand in 1991 they could bring that into their calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister for Health cannot do that, she could at least respond to the same point put a different way. Some local authorities, faced with these genuine anxieties, are considering withdrawing completely from residential care in the coming year and handing over responsibility in an organised, planned way to housing associations with which they already have a relationship of trust, or setting up their own housing association which would be responsible for their fleet of residential homes. In that way, they would assure themselves of proper continuity of management and proper standards of care and, at the same time, attract housing benefit and income support not through the rates, as amendments Nos. 250 and 251 propose, but in the form of residential care and nursing home fees. If they did so before April 1991, they would also attract attendance allowance, which is a considerable factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot assure local authorities of housing benefit and income-type support after April 1991, she could at least assure us that local authorities that are considering floating off all their residential care responsibilities to a single operator which, in effect, they will control, will not have imposed upon them any impediment by way of subsequent regulations that would prevent that development before April 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister does not accept the amendments, she will deprive elderly people of choice. They will no longer have a choice between private and public care because clause 39 will penalise local authorities even further. They will be left unable to provide more homes and they will face the prospect of selling what they already have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) spoke, I made a list of one or two excellent homes in my constituency which I visited as a member of the social services committee of the council. They included Willowfield, Oxley house and Kershaw house, where my mother-in-law resides. She went from a sheltered scheme into Kershaw house in the village in which she was born. It is an excellent home which has a superb orientation programme and highly skilled and well-trained staff. The thought of a For Sale sign being erected over Kershaw house fills me with horror.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) is not in his place. He shouted from a sedentary position when my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield mentioned Bradford and the scandal of what its council is doing. We see in Bradford the actions of a Government who have, for the first time, allowed people to be sold off in their own homes. These elderly people were treated like goods and chatties, which is why some of them resorted to the courts. It is distressing to read their remarks, many of which have been reported in the press. After talking to some Bradford Members of Parliament who have tried to
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
be good Members of Parliament, I visited them and tried to allay some of their fears. I felt extremely distressed. Many of them even now feel anxious about the future and dreadfully insecure. The Government should feel ashamed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All expert advice is against the clause. The Association of Directors of Social Services has warned the Government that, in the event of private voluntary home closure or a resident running out of funds, a local authority will be unable to intervene under the clause. The safety net will have been removed. The Government should think long and hard before letting this happen. They should not allow their hatred of any form of local democracy to blind them to the need for proper care for the elderly but that is what is happening. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry bragged when he was in charge of the Department of the Environment that his dream was to meet local authorities once a year and dish out contracts. That would be the end of any real local democracy and local authority involvement, but that is the ultimate aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is unworkable. The Government could accept our amendments and thereby show compassion for the most vulnerable in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister responds, we want no flowery words or nice phrases. We want it straight from the shoulder: who pays? It appears that the Government are trying to drive local authority homes into the private sector and intend to ask the community to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some extremely good private homes, but without doubt profit is their motive. If it were not, they would not exist. There is also a high turnover of owners of private homes as they make their bob or two, move on to something else and let in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four weeks ago a friend telephoned me. He was an apprentice when I worked in industry. He has moved in various spheres and he asked for my help to obtain land on which to build an aged persons home. I asked him why he was moving out of industry into that sector and he said, "To make a lot of money." He made no bones about it. He said, "Don't you realise how much money there is in private nursing homes? My wife is a matron, so it will be virtually an in-family business."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His problem, for which I had to decline help, was that he wanted to build the home in a local park which is part of a conservation area. I have nothing against private homes and his choice of site was excellent for many reasons, but he made no bones about his motive, which was profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the home to which I have referred previously the manager runs a tight ship. The staff turnover is tremendous because of the pressures brought to bear on the staff, as the staff who left told me. When I took up the case with the manager, he did not like it and openly said, "I am here to make profit for my shareholders. That is my prime concern. The nursing concern is for those whom I employ". Therefore, the person who runs the home has no interest beyond profit. He said, "All Members of Parliament have big mouths, and you probably have the biggest of the lot", which meant that I was on the right track.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the amendments and say that she will treat local authority homes and private homes equally. Having talked to our social services
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
director, I know that the local authorities will do their best to keep their homes, but there may come a time when they will have to pass them on, simply because they are not treated equally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will create the problem of lack of choice. If every home is a private home, as my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), said, there will be no safety net, and that is something on which many people rely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government allowed the expansion of private homes, we told them that they had a tiger by the tail. It was fine at the time, but when private homes are in the hands of people whose motive is profit making, irrespective of how good are the homes, that motive predominates. They want a little bit more, then a little bit more and so on. The Government are trying to extricate themselves from their mistake in promoting the private nursing home business because of the sheer cost of it. They are trying to move the cost to someone else. If the Minister is truthful, she will admit that that someone else is the poll tax payer. That is what is meant by topping-up. The term would not be used if the Minister did not believe that the action would be needed and if she thought that the Government's plans would cover the expenditure on nursing homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Topping-up will be done through the poll tax bill. What will happen if the safety net goes and with it local authority homes? Who will pay for the topping-up? The people who buy the homes for investment will want a profit, and they will make one only by increasing their charges. The increased charges will be paid by the poll tax payer. The community that the local authority used to serve will have to pay through the nose for what remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, local authority homes provide day care and meals on wheels for hundreds of people. Ministers may say that that could happen under private enterprise; so it could, but at a cost. Elderly people whose homes are without proper facilities go to the local authority homes to use the baths. The ladies go for hair-dos. Those services will disappear if the homes have to make a profit. I want to know who will pay; the Minister should admit that it will be the poll tax payer. My constituency is a low-wage area because there is no industry. On the notional rate of 222p estimated by the Government, the poll tax will be £322, £324 or £325.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fire service, which looks after its old people's homes very well, has had to consider its finances. It will have to pay increased charges. I received a letter from the fire service today asking for advice about the financing of water mains to its homes and telling me that private water services were installing a reduced main. The fire service will have to pay for a larger main, and again poll tax payers will be involved. The extra expenditure will be financed by the poll tax payer. There will come a time when people cannot and will not pay, and we are getting close to it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak in support of the amendments. By rendering ineligible for income support or housing benefit those who find themselves in the local authority sector, the Government are making nonsense of the White Paper. I do not completely agree with the emphasis given to whether ownership should be public or private. There is nothing that this or any other Government can do about the massive demographic shift in the population that will
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
continue for the remainder of the century. Private provision is inescapable and probably essential. Given the income tax generating capacity, I do not see how, from the public purse, those in earning age groups could fully provide for those who are not earning but are "dependent" to some degree on the state. There could not be public provision for all, or even for the majority. That would not be tenable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is to achieve equity. Private provision is essential; it should therefore be encouraged in a way that ensures the highest possible standards and diversity. At the same time, adequate, good quality public provision should be maintained to act, if needed, as a safety net. The White Paper recognises that without local authority provision, residential care across the spectrum cannot be guaranteed. A funding system is proposed that will put the provision and maintenance of local authority care at risk. There is inequity in the disallowing of eligibility for income support and housing benefit that will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the local authority sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said earlier that that will have two effects. Local authorities will not enter into the funding arrangements because they will not have the finance to maintain them, or having done so, they will try to shelve their existing overheads by transferring their own property into the private sector. Some examples of that effect in Bradford were cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both implications undermine the role of the public sector, but, more importantly, they undermine the principles behind the White Paper. I do not understand how the Government can resist the logic of the amendments. I hope that they recognise the need to put the funding system for public and private provision on an equal footing. If they do not, public provision will wither on the vine and be no more than the basic underpinning of residential care for the elderly. The demographic reality will not go away and neither will the funding implications. The shift in resources will fly in the Government's face. I hope that the Minister will consider the position as it is outlined in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, any local authority that places an individual in a private residential home does so at no cost to the local authority. There could not be a more unequal playing field. A local authority that places an individual in one of its residential homes does so under the existing regime. That regime will continue to exist except in so far as individuals will receive the same personal allowance as individuals in private residential homes. Individuals in a local authority residential home in future will be treated more fairly and be in an improved position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, but surely the Minister agrees that in many cases it costs the public sector more if an individual is in a private sector home rather than directly provided local authority accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point. First, I want to say more about the regime as it is now and as it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with individuals in local authority homes. Under the future regime, the local authority will have to purchase the place in the private home for the individual and to make good the difference between what is returned in housing benefit and income support, having deducted the personal allowance. The local authority will need not only to purchase the place but to make a contribution to it when the individual's means require that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving towards a more level playing field, but we do not intend to prevent people in local authority homes from claiming housing benefit and income support on the same basis as those in private homes. The arrangements are less complex than many hon. Members seem to think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention is that in future resources will be used much more rationally. The criticism of the existing system, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) noted, is that resources are often used in a perverse and irrational manner. Under the future system, the local authority will be the gatekeeper. It will purchase places in independent or private residential homes, or decide whether individuals should go to the home provided by local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many in the private sector have asked why, under the new regime, local authorities should use the independent sector: they will be the gatekeepers and will undertake the assessments and thus have the incentive to assess and to place people in local authority homes. People in the private sector have argued for many years that the system of registration was unfair because the private sector had to meet the standards of registration but the public sector was relieved of any need to meet similar standards. We are determined that under our arm's-length inspection unit local authority and private sector homes will have to meet the same high standards. There will be more pressure to take a rational decision on whether domiciliary or day care might be more appropriate than placing individuals in a local authority home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding from the social security budget that currently provides for the care of those placed in independent homes will, under the new regime, come through the social services net for new residents. How can we ensure that that regime does not become a bonanza for local authority expansion? I accept that there are many high-quality local authority homes, but I draw the Committee's attention to the Griffiths report, which stated that social services authorities should not be allowed to become monopoly suppliers of residential and non-acute nursing home care. How can we protect against a monopoly and monolithic provision of care? The funding system is intended to promote and to encourage a mixed provision of care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain the use of the word "bonanza"? She said that she was keen to ensure that there was not a bonanza for local authorities. Does she mean that she intends to provide a bonanza for the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present system has all the makings of producing a bonanza for the private sector. As I said, an individual can be placed in a private home without an assessment of need. No regime could do more to encourage the use of the private sector. Much private sector care is of high quality and has made an important contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister think that no assessment is made before a person is placed? Would it surprise her to know that, before anyone is placed, my authority makes a case study to decide what is best for the person involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the present regime, there is no requirement for an assessment of need. A local authority conscious of its resources would swiftly consider a private residential home. I do not condemn the practice of many local authorities. I am enormously impressed by the provision of care in Newcastle, where the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) comes from, through a collaborative venture with Anchor Housing. There is much collaborative activity already. I was in Birmingham last weeek discussing the provision of care in the community, and shortly before that I visited the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims). It is important to establish a framework within which there can be a more rational use of resources in the interests of vulnerable people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anchor Housing will be impressed by the Minister's reference to it. Members of the Committee have received a letter from Anchor Housing saying that as a result of the intolerable gap between income support payments and charges, it lost £250,000 last year and is unable to sustain that loss in the coming year. Given her support for Anchor, we look to the Minister to do something about that gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is in danger of standing the White Paper on its head. I understand that a provision has been inserted in the Bill to prevent a bonanza expansion of local authority homes. That is not what she and her right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State said in the White Paper. After describing the provision, the White Paper states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"All authorities will need to review the extent to which they need to maintain homes of their own in these circumstances." </p></blockquote> It appears to want local authorities not merely to hold their own or to expand but to contract and to run down the number of homes that they have. That is the only meaning that can be taken from that sentence in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a travesty of the situation. Considerable additional resources will be given to local authorities to disburse for the provision of those who need residential care. We aim to ensure a mixed economy of care in which there will be variety and innovation, where the voluntary and the private sector have a full and important part to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much misunderstanding about local authorities' provision. I intended to draw on the paragraph to which the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) referred. We make it clear in paragraph 3.4.11 of the White Paper that we
	<br><blockquote><p>"will expect local authorities to retain the ability to act as direct service providers, if other forms of service provision are unforthcoming or unsuitable. In order to do this, the local authority will need to retain capacity, skill and experience in key service provision functions. This is likely to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
particularly important in services for people with high levels of dependency, or particularly challenging patterns of behaviour, whose care it is essential to safeguard."</p></blockquote>
Those comments are unequivocal and I hope that hon. Members are reassured by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities have taken the proposals to mean that the Government intend them to cease direct provision of residential care at an early opportunity. That is not the case. We want local authorities to think through how they will provide and ensure the provision of a range of suitable and appropriate care for frail and vulnerable people. That will be the key to their community care plans and it is inherent in our proposals. We want them to think carefully before deciding not to make any provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister whether she intended by regulation or in some other way to prevent local authorities worried about the future from floating off all their provision into the hands of a housing association or a body that was, in effect, the local authority in another form? Will she assure us that she will not seek to prevent that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key to our proposals is that they give local authorities responsibility in a vital area of activity. It is for them to plan carefully for those for whom they are responsible. Many would argue that community care responsibilities should be taken over by a central agency or by the health authorities. We believe that they are a local authority responsibility. Perhaps I have more confidence than many Labour Members in local authorities' ability to undertake the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston again mentioned resources. Time and again we have said that adequate resources will be available. Inevitably they are part of the public expenditure round discussions, and it would be unprecedented to anticipate their outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If adequate resources will be made available, why do we need a top-up scheme? What resources will be available? Where will the money come from? If funding covers one year, what will it be based on and how will it work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle behind the top-up scheme is a mechanism to enable local authorities to make an additional contribution. We do not intend to undermine that principle. Adequate resources will be available. We shall be able to give specific information as the year progresses. The money that is used to fund the care of those in residential homes will transfer from the Department of Social Security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of all the misleading remarks that have been made about the Bill this afternoon, was not one of the wildest the suggestion of the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) that we were moving towards a laissez-faire model? Is not the present situation, where there are separate and uncoordinated sources of care for the patient and no one is charged to evaluate patients' interests, a laissez-fiare model? The Government's proposals introduce cohesion and coordination into the system with one authority charged with directing resources and one charged with evaluating patients' interests. Is not that the opposite of a laissez-faire system? If the Labour party understood that, would that not be a leap forward in its understanding of what the Bill is about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good on you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Muttering has broken out in the Committee. The Minister is entitled to a fair hearing. I ask hon. Members to be quiet while she is speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point excellently. We shall move from a relatively laissez-faire system to a managed system of partnership with the private and voluntary sectors. It will be a managed system in which contracts will be placed. It will be important to maintain quality by monitoring contracts and to have some check and follow-up through case management of those who are placed in private homes. One of those arrangements exists under the present regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members in their hearts, perhaps because of their trade union roots, believe that one can properly control only what one owns and what one provides and they believe in the inevitable tendency for the producer interest to dominate. It underlines all their remarks. Conservative Members are interested in the user, the consumer, the individual. We know that the individual could not care less whether care comes from the private sector, the voluntary sector or the local authority. Individuals want high-quality, good-value care, and that is what the Government will secure under the new regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is interested in the user and the individual, will she tell us why she did not intervene in the Bradford case, when users and individuals went to court to try to prevent local authority homes being sold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like Opposition Members to consult the writings of Tessa Jowell. She states time and again that the key to community care is to consider the interests of the consumers rather than the providers. That is the nub of the difference between the ideas of Conservative and of Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke (Monklands, West)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that Tessa Jowell, who is extremely distinguished and has great knowledge of residential care, would certainly not support the Government's proposals? If the Minister is really interested in the views of the user and the consumer, will she tell us what user and consumer organisations—if any—support the Government's policies on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consumer should have a choice of services. Opposition Members stir up people's fears, as in the case mentioned by the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon), so it is understandable that people feel alarmed. Local authorities need to be able to provide a range of services for individuals who require residential care. That is what our proposals seek to ensure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston spoke about local authority homes acting as resource centres. If local authorities use the private and voluntary sectors to the full, they will not be busy providing a vast range of residential care and will probably be able to invest their energy and time in more creative and innovative projects. They may decide to work with the voluntary and independent sectors in creating resource centres, but they will gain the flexibility to contribute to special areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise the importance of training, which is why we are spending £500,000 in following up the Wagner report's recommendations, and working with the National Institute for Social Work. When they draw up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0844">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>
their community care plans, local authorities will want to discuss how they can help to provide higher standards of care through training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Manchester city council spends about £85,000 on training care staff for residential homes for the elderly. The education department arranged courses in Manchester colleges for care staff in the private sector, but they could not take place, because the private sector would not fund its staff to go on them. Will the Minister comment on that, and tell the Committee what action she intends to take to ensure that the private sector plays a part in training staff, rather than simply taking staff from the local authority once their training has been funded by the city council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the new regime local authorities will gain greater leverage through placing contracts with the private and voluntary sectors. It may be part of the contract that sufficient staff should have been trained. For the first time the proposals ensure a measure of control and of influence, and they provide the authorities with leverage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals will ensure that those who go to local authority homes will not be in the same relationship as those who are in private homes under the present regime. That regime overwhelmingly favours the private sector. There will be sufficient incentives to ensure that local authorities become not monolithic and monopolistic providers of care but bodies that are involved in collaborative work with other providers to ensure that the consumer benefits from high-quality residential care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should clarify the financial mechanics of the Bill. I do not understand them, and there seems to be some confusion about them among my hon. Friends. Before we can clearly understand the Government's intentions we need to have the mechanics clearly explained. We need further explanation of the implications for people in existing local authority and private sector homes. We need further explanation of the future of existing clients and also of the future clients in both sectors. Where will the money come from in each case and who will pay the bill? The answers to those questions will allow us to know whether there will be a level playing field. We shall also know how much extra money local authorities will have to find to provide residential accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the answers, even after hearing many explanations from both Conservative and Labour Members. When the Minister replied, I think that she genuinely wanted to clarify the proposals—at last that was her intention. We need to understand the Government's intentions towards both private and public care. There should be a chart that ilustrates where the money will come from how much will come, and what the responsibilities of the providers will be, or the Minister should clarify each of those points in her reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), brilliant as he is, will assume that he knows the answers. But what he believes will be the outcome of the proposals might not be what the Minister or I believe them to be. We are not required to accept the Government's proposition, but we are required to understand it in order that we may criticise it, or support it effectively. I refuse to accept the preconceived opinions of Committee members
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
on whether the funding proposal is good or bad because I do not understand the financial mechanics of the Bill. Until we all understand them it will not be possible for the Committee to reach a rational decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's request for the Minister to give precise information is extremely appropriate. The matter is made puzzling when the Minister talks of fairness, and yet in response to a question we were told that the Minister did not know why the Government's contribution to support people living in homes for the elderly were not to be calculated on the same basis for both public and private homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not explained her principle for dealing with the calculation in different ways. She has not explained why the same money should not follow the individual on the ground that money should follow the patient. she has not explained the mechanics of support as she was asked to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those of us who heard the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) will know that Ministers have given contradictory replies. I do not blame them for that because it is a complex affair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know what the position is. The Minister for Health said that the Government's objective was not to run down local authority provision, and that she wanted a mixed economy in care. She said that local authorities, would not be required to divest themselves of their homes. She said also that local authorities would accept responsibility for people with special needs, and she listed, from the White Paper, the sort of people who would qualify for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition argue that there is an incentive to close homes; it has been built into the financial mechanism. I do not know which position is correct. Perhaps the Minister is right. However, until one understands the financial mechanics in detail, one cannot assess that. I shall not accept that the Government's policy is to close the homes until I understand the financial mechanics. The financial mechanisms have been over-interpreted. We need the chart that I described earlier, which would show the responsiblities that will be placed on local authorities and the private sector, and show where the money will come from, and in what amounts. Once we have that, we shall be able to establish the Government's motivation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an intellectually stimulating contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax and I sit together because, as simple Yorkshire folk, we need one another's support. We like to get down to the basics. The Minister for Health said—and this is a basic issue—that her objective was not to run down local authority direct residential care provisions. I do not accept that because it is the Government's aim, as local authorities and professional and voluntary organisations realise. Local authorities are already starting to rundown care provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Bradford, as in other authorities, we have nearly reached the stage where no direct local authority accommodation is provided. How will that local authority and others like it legally fulfil their obligations to provide for people whom the private and the voluntary sectors will not touch?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0845">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that the shift was beginning and that local authorities were taking decisions. If the Minister is right, it means that those local authorities are misunderstanding the financial mechanisms that govern the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They understand them very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps they do, in which case the Minister is wrong. Again we return to the conflict of interpretation. If local authorities are taking decisions that are based on their understanding of the financial mechanisms behind the Bill, a greater responsibility is placed on Ministers to clarify the position. The Minister for Health said that decisions were being taken for the wrong reasons. A clear statement is needed to stop the drift which worries my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and which I would be concerned about if I knew that it was taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try again. The point of the proposals is to establish a more level playing field than the present regime, which is overwhelmingly biased in favour of the private sector and of residential rather than domiciliary or many other forms of care. The Government intend that local authorities should continue to be able to fulfil their statutory duties. Therefore, we expect them to retain in many instances the ability to be a service provider, but it is a matter for them through their care plans to be satisfied that they have the ability to fulfil their statutory obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Workington (Mr.Campbell-Savours) that I have agreed to circulate a chart to Committee members which makes the position clear,but let me take him through the matter once again. Those in local authority homes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Those in local authority homes are charged under the mechanism dating back to 1948 which we discussed this morning, where there is a minimum charge and a personal allowance which together amount to the retirement pension. They are then charged up to the level of the economic cost according to their means. We intend to make that means assessment under the new regime more equitable in relation to the more generous means assessment currently available to those who have their means assessed on the basis of income support. That covers those who are in local authority homes and those who will come in to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in private homes are at present financed on the basis of the income limit, if they are in need. They may also have attendance allowance, but it is unlikely to be more than the income limit for those in residential homes. The overwhelming majority of those in private homes after 1 April 1991 will have their position preserved—that is, if they can claim income support for residential care now, they can continue to do that. We have debated at length the precise limits. If they are in one of the exempted groups —for example, those under pension age—they will be able to receive assistance from the local authority. That applies to current private residents and those who will remain in the private sector. Those who in future go into private or voluntary homes will be able to claim income support and housing benefit as they would if they were at home with their own facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities will purchase places in a range of homes and be able to make a place available to individuals.
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
They will again administer their assessment of means. The increased minimum charge, which confused the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) this morning, exists because those individuals will receive housing benefit and income support, unlike those in local authority homes. It is important to have a different minimum charge to ensure that the personal allowance which they will have is the same as the personal allowance for those in local authority homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That summarises the position in a nutshell, I hope. Local authorities will be able to provide a range of provisions. We want them to innovate and we want a mixed economy of care. We are convinced that those are the right mechanisms, through the local authorities, for ensuring that there is a proper, rational use of resources and a high standard of care for that ever-growing group of vulnerable people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Minister a piece of paper at the end of our sitting splitting up the various areas, existing provision, the future of existing clients and new clients. It will have a number of columns dealing with financial support. Will the Minister arrange for them to be filled in and perhaps circulated to the Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) laughs, but he made an important point. He said that there was a drift, which we have a responsibility to stop. If people are taking decisions based on inaccurate information, that must be made clear to them. The White Paper and ministerial statements are leading to decisions being taken which the Minister told the Committee should not be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Minister on these detailed points, but much may hinge on them. She mentioned the attendance allowance, which is currently payable in private residential and voluntary homes. Attendance allowance is a quite different form of benefit from income support or housing benefit. It is not subject to any of the means tests to which income support and housing benefit are subject. It is paid according to the physical needs of the recipient, not his financial resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister said is extremely interesting. She has said that under the existing system, in private or voluntary sector residential care, attendance allowance can continue to be claimed by residents. She suggested to me, however, that under the new system, after April 1991, it will not be payable to people who enter private or voluntary sector residential accommodation. That is another gap in the financial resources for people in that sector of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister propose to close that gap in resources, which she has created by denying those people attendance allowance? Any withdrawal of attendance allowance from those people constitutes a denial of the fundamental feature of the attendance allowance system —that it is paid not according to financial resources but simply according to the physical needs of the person concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a number of remarks in the debate, and I shall take up some of the most significant. First, we should put aside the quite separate debate on where the balance of advantage lies between residential care and community care. That would be an important and useful debate, but it has nothing to do with the question before the Committee—when residential care is the right option and which sector of residential care should be chosen. It would be a diversion to spend too
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>915</span>
much time debating the advantages and relative benefits of residential care and care in community. There will be an explosion in the number of elderly in the next decade, and more of both types of accommodation will be needed, which is why I find the proposition before us so perverse. It is plainly fashioned to encourage the contraction one of the principal players in the provision of residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the Minister's response to my remarks seemed to suggest that the White Paper was extraordinarily sloppily drafted and that we had failed to understand what the Government were trying to say in it. The guilty people are here, and I should be interested to hear their observations on the fact that they have failed so badly to convey in the White Paper the Government's intentions that the Opposition have unanimously, with the exception of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), failed to understand the intention of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington kindly referred to me as brilliant. I deny such a description; I claim no financial expertise. But while I laboured in the trade union movement, I spent five years studying the English language. My powers of comprehension of the written word are at least average. When I come across a sentence which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All authorities will need to review the extent to which they need to maintain homes of their own"</p></blockquote>,
I have difficulty re-interpreting that to mean that local authorities should not go in for a bonanza of expansion. Someone on the Bench behind the Minister has some explaining to do about how that sentence found its way into the White Paper if it is not the Government's intention that local authorities should contract, and if their intention was to achieve not exactly a level playing field but one tilted in the local authority's direction. We shall not fall for such an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bogus to compare the proposals in the Bill with present circumstances. I agree with the Minister that the current situation is unsatisfactory, but it is entirely of the Government's creation and they have presided over it for a decade. At least, at present, the presumption is that local authorities run their own homes. They have no power to purchase or pay for places for elderly persons in others' private homes. The presumption is that if a social worker's client requires residential care, the appropriate place for such care is the local authority's home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new system, the social worker will be a case manager. He will be faced with a clear, explicit decision in his role as gatekeeper, to which the Minister referred. As gatekeeper, he will decide which home to select for his client, given the presumption that he can select from across the range of public and private provision, in the full knowledge that if he selects the private provision it will be half the cost of the public provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no doubt about what decision will be expected in these circumstances. No doubt the district auditor and the Audit Commission are lurking somewhere out there, listening to our proceedings and ruminating over fiduciary duty and what they will do to local authorities that do not take advantage of the scheme to maximise their revenue from benefits by placing people in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
The Minister said that she favoured a mixed economy of care. Amen to that. I have not heard anyone during this debate, which began some time ago, who is opposed to such an economy. But I draw the Committee's attention to the kind of mixed economy that the Minister supports. The paragraph which the Minister quoted suggests that local authorities should:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"retain the ability to act as direct service providers, if other forms of … provision are unforthcoming".</p></blockquote>
For whom should they retain it? The paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is likely to be particularly important in services for people with high levels of dependency, or particularly challenging patterns of behaviour".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the only mixed economy envisaged in that paragraph, which the Minister quoted as her model, is one in which the local authority's provision is an admission of failure—failure to stimulate the private sector to take over mainstream provision, or an admission that a particular client is someone for whom private sector has failed to make provision. Her model means residual care—picking up the pieces left behind by the private sector. In my view, that is not a mixed economy. In a genuine mixed economy, local authorities should be allowed and encouraged to provide mixed provision across the spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the questions that I asked before lunch. I regret that although a whole team in Committee has had three hours in which to consider them, we have received no reply from the Minister to most of those questions. The Minister repeatedly said that she favoured high quality residential care and that that is the purpose of the Bill. I say this as gently as I can: one does not ensure that the Bill delivers high quality residential care by constantly asserting that it will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the question that I asked at 12.45 pm today. What evidence is there that the private residential sector provides higher quality care than the local authority sector? What evidence does the Minister have to support the contention that if we supplant the local authority residential care sector with private and voluntary provision, that will result in higher quality care? There is some evidence, on which the Opposition have touched, that the reverse may be so, and in particular that services such as rehabilitation and occupational therapy will be at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I posed another question to which we have had no reply: what will happen to homes that act as a focus for wider community services for those who are not resident, but who are elderly and need social support and a community leisure outlet? What will happen to those services if those homes go into the private sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is striking that the Government could not even answer this question. Surely it is one that they would have considered. What evidence is there that private sector operators who may take over local authority homes will run them more cheaply than local authorities do? In so far as anyone has quoted figures on that, they are the figures that I quoted at the outset, which show that the contrary is true; the local authority sector gives value for money and achieves the most efficient delivery of residential care at minimum cost. In the absence of contrary financial evidence, what logic is there for transferring to the private sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to my conclusion. The Minister was good enough to speculate on our motivation and on what experience has led to our prejudiced approach, in her view, to this debate. Perhaps I may share with the Minister the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0847">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>917</span>
experience that I have had since the Committee adjourned at one o'clock. It makes me speak with additional vigour and feeling on this issue. For most of the three-hour adjournment, I was on the telephone to my constituency. I was dealing with a factory where the 150 work force was summoned to a meeting today at 12 o'clock. They were told that the factory was closing, that they had until one o'clock to get out of the building, and that they would have 90 days redundancy pay thereafter. The company is called Slumberdown and is known to many Committee members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very hard company!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should extend some charity. The company gives high consumer satisfaction. I do not know of any consumer complaining about it. It was taken over on 29 January by a company which closed it on 13 February. Given the speed with which it moved from purchase to closure, it is patent that the sole reason for the purchase was to close the factory and render those people unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have observed what happens in a pattern of private ownership: rapid turnover and transfer of ownership turning rapidly into closure. From that experience and others, I have some prejudice against leaving the provision of residential care for the elderly largely in the hands of the private sector. I well understand why many elderly people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon.

Because of that experience, there is some anxiety in our minds about what happens if care of the elderly transfers into the system in which homes can be bought and sold, and in which their future development can change with the decisions of the new owners. That is why some people will wish there to be public sector homes that they can choose to enter for their last few years. Those people may not exhibit more challenging behaviour, as the White Paper suggests. They may not be the more demanding clients. They may merely wish to have the choice of local authority accommodation available to them. The Minister said that choice was the key to the issue. Very well. Why remove that choice, as the Bill is plainly designed to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was good enough to quote Tessa Jowell. I will strike an immediate bargain with her on the words of Tessa Jowell. I happily undertake that we will take to heart the passage that she quoted from Tessa Jowell about giving importance to the consumer and the client rather than to the provider, if she will equally take to heart Tessa Jowell's comments on the Bill, not one clause of which she supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an easy test that will tell us how genuine the Minister is when he says that choice is the key. What about the users, the consumers and the clients who are at present the residents of old folks' homes in local authority ownership and who now face the prospect of a transfer? there we have a group of users to whom we should listen; there we have consumers to whom we should pay attention and whom we should put beyond the interests of providers. Will the Minister write into the Bill consultation with those people and the right of those users and consumers to block the transfer of their home? I will willingly give way if she wishes to intervene and give us that concession, because such a guarantee would go a long way towards removing our anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not willing to give us that guarantee and that elementary safeguard—I divine from her silence that she is not—about the right of present residents to be consulted about the future of their home, her talk about choice is bogus. She is not giving those people choice. Choice implies retaining their homes in local authority ownership and at least leaving those local authorities a level playing field on which to make that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I can only advise my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment and to give the world outside the Committee the assurance that, although we may not succeed on this occasion, this is one aspect of the Bill that the next Government will give priority to undoing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No amendments have been tabled to clause 40, but it is an interesting clause because it refers us back to some of our previous discussions about the way in which capital resources—particularly the ownership of property—are to be taken into account. Could the Minister therefore give us an idea of the circumstances in which directions will be issued under clause 40? In particular, in what cases would the provisions of subsection (1) apply? What kinds of direction will be proposed under clause 40(1)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Directions will be drawn up under the clause to ensure a more ameliorating result from using the provision to take a charge against an individual. For example, if it will cause hardship, although there are some adverse circumstances, we would issue the directions. There has been a long-term intention to implement this provision, but it has not been possible to do so because of the lack of a direction-making power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, therefore, the purpose of the directions is to ameliorate the existing 1948 regime as it applies in residential care directly provided by local authorities. Has it occurred to the Minister that a similar power of direction might well be useful under her new system, to be provided in circumstances where the income support regime might otherwise apply, and that a similar degree of amelioration for similar purposes might well be necessary there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the content of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) is engaged in matters spiritual and cannot be with us today, so he has asked me to speak to amendment No. 717.1 then intend to speak to amendments Nos. 269, 270, and 271 and new clause 1
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of all amendments is to try to write into the Bill a clear duty for a local authority to consult various bodies in the drawing up of its community care plans. The purpose of amendment No. 717 is to ensure that there is full consultation with relevant district health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know the enormous problems that have arisen from, for example, the closure of large institutions. We have heard health authorities assert that there would be adequate community care available for people coming out of those hospitals, only to find that in practice in some areas that community care has not been forthcoming. It is essential that there is a clear duty on local authorities to consult the district health authority in the drawing up of their plans. I cannot imagine that in most areas there would be a problem. The problem arises not where the services are very poor, but where they are very good. For
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
example, where a district health authority has pioneered a high quality of community health care, professional anxieties can arise about the role of the local authority, which can quickly lead to a lack of communication. When people are frightened or angry about the possibility of a takeover bid, there is a greater danger of lack of consultation than where there are rather feeble services, with no one taking a protagonistic position. Amendments Nos. 717 and 718 seek to secure consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the other amendments that stand in my name is to insist that social services departments take account of the views of the users of the service and also of their advocates. I strongly believe that many people find it much easier to articulate what they want with the assistance of a friend or someone else than by themselves. I do not necessarily refer to people who have a disability that makes it difficult for them to communicate. It is often much easier to get someone to plead one's cause than to plead it oneself. The purpose of the amendments is not only to set up an advisory committee to assist in the drawing of the original plan, but also to ensure that there is a continuing interest in how the service is developed and laid out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those aims are important for a variety of reasons, one of which is to guarantee quality. There is no doubt that the users of the service will be a better source of information about the quality of the service than the hard-pressed care managers and others who hope that they are delivering a good service, but often have to take it on trust. With an increasing reliance on the voluntary organisations to provide the service—which I welcome, although I understand their reservations about being too deeply involved—it will be even harder for them to be critical of the way in which it is provided. To have a guaranteed input from the consumers and their advocates is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would be much more cost-effective to have the community care plan drawn up and monitored by the users of the service. We have been provided with a number of devastating examples. CHOICE—the case management service—sent us a number of cases, as did a number of other organisations. I shall cite only one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An elderly man with mobility problems following a stroke was receiving the services of 12 different agencies, but felt that his voice was not being heard in all the professional assessments. There was family conflict, because all the professions were saying that he was capable of being more independent. However, he had been given an inappropriate wheelchair and the fact that his rotten floorboards were causing problems had been missed by all the services. It was only when the case manager worked things out in partnership with the man that the confusion was sorted out, enabling the man to regain much of his lost independence. As a consequence of consulting the consumer, of 21 workers, only three needed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have had meetings with consumers—and consumer organisations—who have made it clear that many of the things that they want to make their lives much better are cheaper, quicker and simpler to deliver than many of the things that well-meaning professionals would like to foist upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason for our tabling the amendments runs into clause 42 and I shall not dwell on it. It would be valuable to involve—and make sure that we involve— ethnic minorities and special minority groups, which would otherwise be overlooked, including groups of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
people who have alcohol and drugs problems. Many of the difficulties that afflict such consumers tend to be overlooked unless they have some group expression occasionally because they represent a small minority of the total case load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister for Health will have no difficulty in agreeing with me on the objectives; he may have some problems, however, in writing them into the Bill. That should not be so, because the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Authorities should also consult with, and take account of the views of.… representatives of service users and carers in drawing up their plans."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what I am asking for. I also ask that their plans should monitor performance and inform the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing that gives me slight cause for concern is that paragraph 5.10 of the same chapter of the White Paper makes it clear that plans should set out what information about services is to be provided to service users and their carers. The paternalist, top-down implication of the wording means that somewhere in the White Paper there still lurks the idea that the man in the town hall knows best. The people for whom the service is provided should be chatted along, but should not be influential in the creation of the community care plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke), it may be for the convenience of the Committee to say that I intend to suspend the sitting from about 7 o'clock until 8.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee will know, I have in this place a reputation for brevity, which Mr. Speaker has occasionally acknowledged. I shall do my best to retain that reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few moments ago, the Minister said that the Government were interested in the user, the consumer. If she and her colleagues believe that, I happily on behalf of my hon. Friends commend to her amendment No. 27. It is to that amendment that I want to address my remarks. It seeks to insert the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall consult with service users, both directly and via their representative community and voluntary organisations, in drawing up their plans."</p></blockquote>
There seems to be an enormous group of people who have never been asked what they think about community care. They are unique unto themselves and clearly have a view, but we, as a society, never try to find out what that view is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This view might impinge upon important matters—or, to the rest of us, relatively unimportant matters. But decisions can be very important to those whose futures and whose services will be involved in community care plans. The measure of consultation proposed in amendment No. 27 is therefore absolutely reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for such an amendment because existing legislation, which gives the Government and, to be fair, local authorities the power to consult and to take into account the views of individuals and their advocates, is shabbily underused. I cite in evidence not the views of individuals, voluntary organisations or their advocates, but the Department of Health itself, I refer to its document published only a week or so ago which reported that the social service inspectorate, the Department's own inspectorate, had conducted a survey called "Developing
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
Services for Disabled People", dealing with the results of an inspection to monitor the operation of The Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What did the document say about the rights of the consumer? What was its important and telling evidence? I should like to congratulate those responsible for producing it. It said, dealing with section 10 of the Act, which imposes a duty to consult organisations of disabled people when dealing with co-options to public bodies taking decisions that concern them:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In studying the responses to section 10, it became clear that some local authorities had policies that involved consultations with voluntary organisations concerned with disability rather than policies involving consultations with organisations of disabled people."</p></blockquote>
The point there is extremely important. It is not enough for any of us at any level of society where decisions are taken to accept that those who speak for the elderly, the disabled and the carers, have a monopoly of wisdom. Is it not time we gave some of these people the opportunity to speak for themselves?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many of the disabled are fed up to the teeth with what they would describe as "being done unto". I hope that we can advance in these matters and acknowledge their rights to be heard, to be consulted and to express their views from their own experience— sometimes, in the case of carers, for instance, of considerable hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us would wish to patronise the elderly. In my constituency—no doubt hon. Members can produce similar evidence—I recall that when there were great difficulties over the training programme, meaning that day centres would be closed, some of the most articulate people were the elderly, who spoke for themselves. They very persuasive, as I and my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) found, and we had no difficulty understanding their case. There were no complications about it. They persuaded Strathclyde region to change its policies and interpret the Government's training programme in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All too often decisions are taken even about the elderly without our even bothering to ask their views. The amendment makes it clear that we should. We are supposed to live in a democracy, and their views should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in the report, which I draw to the attention of the Minister who is replying, there is a reference to section 9 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986, which deals with the important issue of the provision of information. In the summary of findings there are four important points. Though not the most major points of the report they are relevant to the amendment and to the role of the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a group the Social Service Departments did not provide much relevant information to disabled people that took account of their particular circumstances."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, most Social Service Departments did not provide information in braille or large print."</p></blockquote>
For many of us, that would be relatively unimportant; for those who are blind, it is extremely important. How can we respond to the user, the consumer, if we are not making those facilities available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Little information was provided for people for whom English was not their first language."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>
I certainly take the view that users and consumers who are members of ethnic minorities do not have their rights recognised to the degree that the Committee would wish. The fourth point in the report is:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Social Service Departments without an agreed policy on section 9 appear less likely than those with a policy to have information available for disabled people in suitable formats."</p></blockquote>
Not only did we not have consultation but, by heavens, if we are not listening to those people—[Interruption.] The Secretary of State is distracting the Minister from my attempts to get her to listen to me. I am sure that there will be many references to the report in our Committee proceedings and on the Floor of the House. It is clear that if the Minister's objective was to listen to the user, the consumer, the Government have failed abysmally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would mean a genuine involvement and mutuality of concern at local level, so that as community care plans were prepared people would be taken into the confidence of local authorities and social service departments. That would result in efficiency. Many mistakes are made as authorities attempt to hand down to 6.5 million people with disabilities, and their carers, policies that they think will be acceptable. If we accepted the role of advocacy, many costly decisions would not be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that we did not persuade the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) on advocacy in the private sector, given his speech tonight, in which he made many important points. Perhaps we shall persuade him to support the amendment. I think that he supports the principle of advocacy. There are splendid examples of advocacy in Sheffield. There is no reason why that form of advocacy should not become best practice for the whole country. Then we could develop not just local community care plans, which are profoundly important and dealt with in the clause, but a policy for Great Britain which would mean that the kind of advocacy alliance that is working so well in Sheffield can be used to inspire other areas, local authorities, users and consumers. In community care, as elsewhere, it is important that we develop new ideas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Is it not also true that if the level and timing of consultation are such that it is possible to have a serious input into the resource allocation decision, a very different kind of decision is made? The danger that the Association of Directors of Social Services sees in advocacy is that it will escalate demand unrealistically. If the consultation is sufficiently early, the advocate's request will be made in the framework of a shared knowledge of the resources that are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is a splendid argument. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, is not in his place. Some recent developments in Scotland would confirm that the hon. Member for Mid-Kent is spot on. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, notwithstanding declared Government policy in the White Paper, and notwithstanding what we are told is the Government's approach to care in the community, decided—without consulting anyone so far as I can see—to spend millions of pounds in propping up a Victorian psychiatric hospital. If there had been the kind of consultation to which the hon. Member for Mid-Kent referred, the users, the consumers, might have said, "Is it not better to look at community care?" Would it not have been better to plan to spend that money on community projects such as the excellent EDINVAR project, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) will be aware, where people with disabilities live in the same housing project as people with no disability and they help one another, to the benefit of both sections of that community? I again regret that the hon. Member for Stirling, the Minister, was not in his place when I was referring to him.

When the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Bill was making its way through the House, some of the sponsors, of whom the hon. Member for Mid-Kent was one, had the opportunity to speak with consumers. I shall give the Committee one example. I recall speaking to two ladies in the Glasgow, Govan constituency in a little community care project. They had spent 15 years in a leading psychiatric hospital in Scotland, which I shall not identify, but I ask the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in particular to accept the veracity of this story. The two ladies has been in their own flat for about a year, and when I asked them what they felt was the main difference between their time in the long-stay hospital and living in their flat, they gave what I thought was an astonishing answer, but I accepted it: "You don't get any injections."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that that should be used as a slur on the people who work so well in the Health Service, but if we had developed advocacy representation and consultation that issue would have been raised several times while they were hospitalised. In defence of patients as well as those in the community, amendment No. 27 would be helpful to the Committee and to the Government. I commend it for the approval of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
