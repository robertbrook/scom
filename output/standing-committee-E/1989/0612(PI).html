	<section>
	<div class='title'>ALLOWANCE FOR ABANDONMENT EXPENDITURE RELATED TO OFFSHORE MACHINERY OR PLANT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Amendment proposed [7 June]: No. 138, in page 40, line 46, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where any person carrying on a ring fence trade, in consequence of a demand pursuant to an agreement binding that person and one or more others in relation to the exploration and operation of an oil field, pays an amount to another person (whether or not the operator of the field) in circumstances such that it is unlikely that any appreciable part of the payment will later be returned to him, that payment shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as abandonment expenditure incurred at the time of the payment by the person first above named, where it is paid as a contribution towards the future costs of closing down of, or any part of, an oil field by way of the demolition of machinery or plant which has been brought into use for the purposes of that trade and which is or forms part of an offshore installation or a submarine pipe-line; and where this subsection applies, subsection (5) below shall apply with the necessary modifications.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1B) Subsection (1A) above shall not apply—
	<ol>
	<li>where the person in question has an interest in the oil field of 15 per cent or more, or</li>
	<li>where the main reason, or one of the main reasons, for the making of the demand or the payment was the obtaining of a tax advantage for that person.".—[Mr. Boateng.]</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our deliberations last week the Minister said that fiscal factors should not cause artificially early abandonment of oil fields, particularly those on the margin that are run by small operators. That assurance is welcome, but it sits oddly with the current impact of the Bill if it is not amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have taken the precaution of following through a worked example of the impact of the Bill and the impact of our amendment on such a marginal oil field and have found that there is likely to be an artificially early abandonment of such oil fields, which the Minister seeks to avoid, if our amendment is not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take as an example a small, declining oil field whose petroleum revenue tax is covered by the oil allowance, so no PRT will be paid. Its profits are such that it would not be liable for corporation tax in any of the three years before abandonment. If there were only a small, marginal commercial profit, but nothing else, before abandonment and the abandonment costs were £100 million the consequence of the Bill would be that in the first year—going backwards—the loss would be about £25,000. In the second year profit of £5 million, would be covered by the losses in the first year. In the third year the profit of about £20 million could also be covered by the first-year losses immediately before abandonment. Let us further suppose that four years before abandonment the profit was £35 million, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
five years before the oil field was abandoned it was £50 million. Under the old system no PRT would be paid, because of the impact of the lack of any PRT relief and no corporation tax would be payable after the loss in the third year was carried back. The system set out in the Bill would have the same result. However, if amendment No. 138 were accepted, the company could not benefit by closing the oil field a year early, despite the sacrifice in commercial profits and the loss of jobs, and of oil, that that would entail. The implications would be that one would have a tax repayment with interest of 35 per cent of £5 million, £20 million and £35 million. The company would then be able to reclaim £21 million. If the company closed down a year and a half early, it could reclaim full relief of 35 per cent on £100 million plus. That is a positive tax incentive to be anti-social because the nation would lose jobs and oil as a result of an early close-down. It would be uncommercial because the company could have made a profit during the last year or year and a half. The problem would be eliminated if the three-year claw-back were extended, but the Minister ruled out that option. Our amendment would also remove the commercial advantage that more can be claimed by relief. I hope that the Minister will consider that example and say whether the calculations are wrong. I think that they are correct. Our amendment must be accepted if we are to achieve fiscal neutrality which prevents early abandonment. Will the Minister consider that matter again?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were disappointed by the Minister's response to the concept of a trust fund. He said, and we accepted, that payments to a trust fund had the same commerical effect as actual abandonment expenditure, but that is only true if the tax effect is the same. Were tax relief to be given on payment into a trust fund, which is one alternative or the amendment accepted, the tax effects would be different. In those circumstances, payments into a trust fund would be more advantageous if the three-year clawback limit remained. If the carry-back period is increased the two alternaties would offer tax relief and would be similar in overall effect. But it is not true, as implied by the Financial Secretary, that our amendment would have little effect, because under the current three-year carry-back rule, it would provide effective tax relief in many instances where it is not available now. That would be of special advantage to the small operator, and the nation would benefit from enhanced oil production and the retention of jobs. We would welcome, if not a change of heart, at least a response to those points from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure that the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) is the Opposition spokesman on these matters. It struck me after our previous sitting that there is a new oil field called Brent South. I do not know whether it is named after the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but I know that it, too, is a new discovery, still underdeveloped and with somewhat doubtful economics. I say that in response to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), who claimed that I had only two jokes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall examine the figures that the hon. Gentleman recited to the Committee. In general, we have no evidence from the oil industry that the Bill would have any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
serious effect on the tax implications of abandonment timing. We hope that the changes in the Bill will remove the main features of the existing system that do affect abandonment timing. The hon. Gentleman chose a rather extreme example—high abandonment expenditure on a small, non-PRT paying field, low profits at the end of the field's life and no company profits from other sources for any of the field participants. That combination of circumstances is unusual, and it is not even certain that it would have the suggested effect. Nor is it clear that the amendment would remedy the problems that the hon. Gentleman believes are inherent in the Bill, as a relief for alienated funds generally does not have any effect, but is tax neutral. It would merely raise problems for the Government. Companies given tax relief in advance would have a great incentive to use it in ways that were not intended. As a result, the relief would have to be policed by heavy and complex legislation, which would not be welcomed by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing with the industry other ways in which to deal with the problems described by the hon. Member for Brent, South at our previous sitting. If those discussions recommend further changes in the tax regime attendant on abandonment expenditure, we shall bring in appropriate measures. That is not a promise, merely a description of the aim of the current discussions, which are still exploratory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment, even though the hon. Member for Brent, South and I are united in our desire to avoid a tax regime which artificially induces early abandonment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult for a preson of my size to be seen in this Room, so I apologise to you, Mr. Cormack, if I am sometimes hidden from view. Perhaps I should stand on a chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My opinion of both Front Benches in this matter is rather jaundiced, in that the assurances given to the Committee about the industry's short and long-term intentions give me serious cause to doubt whether either the Government's proposals or the amendment would have the desired effect. Nor am I certain that that effect is even possible, given the way in which oil companies construct their finances in the medium and long-term and their ability to shift resources and utilise tax breaks in the current system. The industry's taxation committee is dominated by major producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions with the Inland Revenue, therefore, inevitably present a picture that favours the interests of the big, rather than the small producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my hon Friend tabled the amendment to redress that balance. That is fair. Perhaps he did so because the report of the Energy Select Committee described a need to introduce tax regimes that do not put small producers at a disadvantage, but help them to develop the exploration and utilisation of previously discovered or undiscovered fields, in which no operational activities have occurred, but which are currently controlled by large companies. The Energy Select Committee recommended that such activities should be covered by a tax regime to assist small producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
However, large and small producers receive significant support from the current regime to assist them to develop and put aside resources in case of depletion and abandonment policies. I come from a different area of marginal fuel resources: a coal community. Our marginal coalfields are regularly depleted by closures, and communities suffer the effects of dereliction, loss of resources and the need to restructure their economy. Unlike the North sea, however, some assets remain. But no one considers tax breaks for the coal communities, or arrangements whereby hundreds of millions of pounds of resources are put aside for the day when the last colliery is closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 2 September last year, a report by Jeremy Elden, an analyst with brokers UBS-Phillips, examined the way in which British Petroleum tried to sell off its final controlling interest in the Ninian field and its related fields. The report examined tax benefits for the small producers, who secured a minimum 2½ per cent interest in selling off some reserves. In the sell-off procedure, the company up-rated the original barrelage from 565 million to 665 million. That suggested that the reserves were 100 million barrels more than the company originally informed the Department of Energy. That was a so-called marginal field. On the subject of minor companies buying into the field, Jeremy Elden's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Magnus interests might be sold to exploration companies which would end up paying no tax on their income from this source. The individual tax outcome would depend on how much these companies were spending on exploration within the U.K.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'It's a great deal for BP's tax position,' he said, adding that BP's tax rate at Magnus was moving up to some 84 per cent."</p></blockquote>
The report continues, that the arrangement would be beneficial to the small investor and the major suppliers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that much special pleading goes on. The industry needs to have a proper depletion policy and a proper financial structure to deal with abandonment when that happens either to individual fields or, in the longer term, to a number of fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently received a letter from one of my constituents who works in the oil industry. This is what he had to say. His overall conclusion about the amendments was that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"aim primarily at the majors, and don't go far enough for anyone. They hit the majors by limiting their PRT repayments; but aid them by slightly extending relief for abandonment costs and accelerating the corporation tax relief substantially. Which side of the balance is higher is anyone's guess, but it may well be a package which overall gives substantial amounts of relief to the majors: certainly the Treasury don't really know. It does little for the minors, or small fields, where PRT is not usually in point and terminal loss relief already gave almost exactly the same relief as clauses 52 and 53."</p></blockquote>
It is clear from that that there has been an attempt by those involved in non-large companies to persuade my hon. Friends that the arrangements are having a catastrophic effect on the minor companies. Joint venturing—putting forward joint funding to guarantee abandonment costs and ensure proper allocation and payment—is one approach. Major producers will use this resource through parent companies with guarantees instead of putting money up front immediately. The small companies suggest that once money has been put into a joint fund, it is effectively lost to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) has an excellent idea to resolve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
The Minister was less than forthcoming in his response to the proposal about funding arrangements. The problems faced by small companies over their relationship with the larger companies could be ended by setting up trust funds. I have jaundiced views about present proposals. It would be better if the industry as a whole were making a contribution to a trust fund for all of the fields when partial or full abandonment is to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future Labour Government will tackle these issues. Unless there is agreement beforehand, the Treasury and the Department of Energy will be at the mercy of oil companies in determining the level of abandonment costs and their write-off to the tax system. When the Treasury is attempting to allocate resources for important social policy considerations, I do not want to see it struggling because resources are being consumed in payment for abandonment policies in the North sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that whatever scheme is agreed in the end, tougher talking with the oil companies about agreements over abandonment takes place. The industry must come to terms now rather than later about the costs. It must sit down with the Government and talk honestly about them. Sabre rattling is going on in the oil press that is reminiscent of the bad old days of the 1970s when oil companies were telling the Government of the day that marginal fields could not be exploited because of taxation policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet what have we seen? All of those so-called marginal fields have not only been exploited but exploited profitably even when oil is sold at less than half the price of the 1970s. We do not want to go back to the days when the Government were put over a barrel about the taxation regime for oil companies at the expense of other tax payers and other aspects of Government expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not be blown aside. We must not give resources to the oil industry at the expense of other areas of capital expenditure and the economic infrastructure of the United Kingdon. If that is a warning shot across the Government's bows, so be it. I am worried and jaundiced about attempts to give additional tax breaks to an industry whose record in exploiting tax loopholes has been less than fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to reply to the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). He suggests that we have not paid as much attention to the representations of small oil companies as we have to those from large oil companies. I assure him that that is not the case. The Inland Revenue and I include in our discussions representatives of BRINDEX, who are at least as sophisticated in putting across their views as are representatives of the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association. It is valuable for us to hear their views, as well as those of the major companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That things do not go all the oil majors' way is evident from the clauses under discussion today. The clauses limiting petroleum revenue tax interest bear most heavily on the majors. The smaller exploration companies, many of which work in fields that do not pay PRT, are not affected and so receive their relief unimpaired. There is nothing to stop big or small oil
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
companies setting up alienated funds now. They will not get tax relief upfront. As I mentioned earlier, and as the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) recognised, upfront tax relief is arithmetically identical to relief at the end, which is foregone in the case of upfront tax relief, so it works out no different over the lifetime of the field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield compared oil with coal. Oil is sui generis; it has a special tax regime—75 per cent of PRT, a royalty charge and corporation tax on its profits. The coal industry has not been a major contributor to the Exchequer's revenues—quite the reverse. Offshore oil has a special regime with legal requirements for abandonment over and above those of other industries. The hon. Gentleman's suspicions that the large oil companies are getting away with something and are being treated overfavourably do not hold up. They have put forward sensible representations, some of which we have accepted and others, as is the way with Treasury Ministers, we have had to refuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said on Thursday, we agreed with the Government's objective in these clauses, although we did not think that they went far enough. However, the Government have now tabled their own amendments and, in those circumstances, I do not wish to move amendments Nos. 96 or 97.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the Financial Secretary for having drawn its attention to the Brent, South oil field. We look forward to meeting the Treasury official who drew its existence to his attention and to thanking the official for that service. We wish the field a long and productive life. We are grateful to the Minister for not mentioning that the product of that field is black and crude. We do not object to the colour, but in this instance the product is just a little more refined. I must respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) who has done the Committee his usual service. We must recognise the environmental responsibility of producers. The Government and the House must ensure that fiscal policy is conducive to environmental protection and does not act as a positive disincentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary should not think that we are going soft on the importance of ensuring that the tax yield properly due to the Treasury from the oil industry is maximised. He should make a statement about a case in the New York jurisdiction of the United States which has been mentioned in the Sunday and specialist press, and has implications for the Treasury and the yield which the Inland Revenue might expect from the oil industry. He should especially note the report in 	<i>Oil Marker Listener</i> of 2 May which dealt with a case in New York involving the company Transnor. It referred to allegations that Exxon and Conoco had conspired to purchase and sell Brent crude at below market prices to depress crude oil prices, which would violate the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
United States' Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the anti-manipulation provisions of its Commodity Exchange Act. That is a matter for anxiety in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worry for Britain is that Conoco and Exxon did not dispute that they had carried out that exercise, which is known as tax spinning, intending to achieve tax certainty on Brent oil sales. By obtaining that certainty companies can pay petroleum revenue tax on the spin-sale price rather than the Inland Revenue's estimated average market price. That represents a considerable loss to the Treasury. The oil taxation office has lost some $9 billion as a result of that tax-spinning exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, but may I draw to my hon. Friend's attention a fact that makes his contribution to the discussion even more important? I understand that the case brought by Transnor has been withdrawn and settled out of court in order to avoid a rehearsal in public of the very issues that my hon. Friend seeks to raise. That only makes it more necessary that he should press the Minister on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend, who clearly follows these matters closely. It is important that we do not have continued silence on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should discuss that case in detail under a later amendment: it is not the only case. I have managed to get my hands on a telex from the 	<i>Financial Times</i> correspondent at the trial in New York. It makes interesting reading. It gives details of the arrangements made by the major companies to have the lawsuit withdrawn and to stuff particular companies' pockets with money to keep them quiet about what has been going on and will, I assume, continue to go on in the North sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to underline to my hon. Friend the kind of assurances that I would look for from a Labour Government. We are told:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Monument Oil and Gas is fast establishing itself as one of the City's favourite North Sea exploration players. For every 20p tiny Monument spends on drilling, the Inland REVENUE is effectively providing a further 80p under the current North Sea TAX regime through offsets of PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX against the group's oil production."</p></blockquote>
That is the kind of tax system that I should love to be in: I would give the Chancellor of the Exchequer my money if he would give me 80p for every 20p that I give him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is special pleading by an industry. At present, for every 20p it spends, a small producer gets back 80p in tax relief. Yet such companies are coming to us complaining that they do not have sufficient resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I assure the Committee that tax law has been following the Finance Act 1987. This matter involves transactions that took place before that. The scope that companies had for determining the price at which they sold crude for tax purposes was sharply restrained by the measures that we introduced in 1987. The Committee then sensibly took action to restrict the scope for tax spinning, as I think it was rightly called. Events prior to that would have occurred under a different tax regime. Obviously we keep the tax regime under continuous review. I hope that that meets some of hon. Members' concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CARRYING BACK OF LOSSES REFERABLE TO ALLOWANCE FOR ABANDONMENT EXPENDITURE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 42, line 37, leave out "subsection (2)" and insert "subsections (2) and (3)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 122 and 123.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 53 provides for extended carryback of losses attributable to the new abandonment allowance. The purpose of the amendments is to allow abandonment losses to be set against any profits of the company, rather than just against trading income from the ring fence trade of North sea exploration and production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I now explain the effect of clause 53, as amended. The clause, together with its amendments, introduces a three-year carryback of losses caused by abandonment expenditure to improve companies' ability to get effective relief quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no oil production revenue from the field at the time of final abandonment. The substantial costs incurred in abandoning offshore facilities may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
mean large corporation tax losses for some companies. Under present rules those losses may be relieved against any profits of the company only of the current or previous year. In some cases, and particularly where the company had no other profitable activity at the future time of abandonment, this could be insufficient effectively to relieve the costs. To assist companies in that position, the clause extends the period for which abandonment losses may be carried back. In future such losses, and only such losses, may be carried back for a period of up to three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, before the amendments, losses attributable to the new abandonment allowance could be carried back beyond the normal one year, up to a maximum of three years only against trading income from the ring fence trade. The purpose of the amendments is to allow abandonment losses to go back against any profits of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change is being made in response to representations that the restriction to ring fence trading profits of the offset of abandonment losses under the carryback extension was unnecessarily restrictive. The oil industry gives the example of a company with only one field or only one remaining field. That may well choose or be forced by its fellow-participators to fund abandonment costs by setting money aside out of current production. The effect of the clause before the amendment is that abandonment losses could be set against oil production income in the years before abandonment only, and not against investment income or gains from the funds set aside. The industry suggests that that could encourage premature field abandonment, in order to take loss relief against earlier, higher, production profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendments meet the concerns of the industry and of hon Members, particularly the hon Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney). In particular, I hope that it will benefit some small companies in the North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendments, which have also been welcomed by the industry, as they provide additional substance. Although abandonment may be some years away, it will be an important part of the history of North sea oil development. It is important that the abandonment should be undertaken with proper sensitivity to the natural environment of the North sea. If the measures assist with that, they should be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the allowances can be set off against profits made in previous years, for up to three years. Has any assessment been made about whether that will extend the lifetime of any fields and whether more reserves could be extracted from a particular field as a result of the provision? If it also achieves that, it is a further reason for supporting the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly our analysis suggests that the provisions will help to prevent premature abandonment in response to fiscal. pressures.

	<div class='title'>LIMIT ON PRT REPAYMENT INTEREST WHERE LOSS CARRIED BACK</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 139, in pasge 77, line 43, leave out from "exceed" to end of line 46 and add
	<br><blockquote><p>"the interest which would have been payable had the date specified in paragraph 16 above for the appropriate repayment been the date falling two months after the end of the later chargeable period mentioned in subparagraph (l)(a) above.".</p></blockquote>
It would be a pity to lose sight of the importance of clause 96. It is particularly significant to companies whose large petroleum revenue tax payments have declined. The clause will mainly affect the majors operating in the larger fields. That is of praticular concern to my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) who does not want the majors to get away with anything in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, PRT can be carried back indefinitely. As the cost of abandoning large fields is high, generally PRT relief at 75 per cent on the whole cost can be claimed. Because not much of it can be claimed against recent PRT payments in respect of a declining field, much of it can be claimed against PRT years ago. I see by the vigorous nodding of his head that that has not escaped my hon. Friend. 	<i>[Interrruption.]</i> The implicit trust of my hon. Friend is always welcome. Would that it were more widely shared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interest was payable for the intervening period, the implications of which have not been lost on those who follow these matters, not least the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Its extremely revealing report in 1987 on the oil tax revenue, which one has recently had occasion to peruse, shows that interest repayments could be in excess of abandonment costs for some large fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a potential area for abuse and remained so until the introduction of this clause. It was also an anomaly because while some money might be clawed back in corpration tax, it was necessary to limit the total repayment of PRT plus interest to 85 per cent of the abandonment expenditure caused by the circumstances of the repayment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, we accept and support the notion that such a limit is appropriate, but we want to find the most rational and logical way of imposing it. If a repayment is generated by a subsequent loss, paying interest on the repayment is not appropriate, because the subsequent loss is carried back, pound for pound, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
ignores inflation. So if interest rates more or less equal inflation, no interest on such a repayment is properly payable. In that case, why allow any interest? Why allow a 75 per cent repayment, plus a fixed maximum interest supplement of 10 per cent or 13.33 per cent of the repayment? Surely it would be more rational and logical to limit the total repayment to the 75 per cent paid by way of PRT, or to allow interest to run from the date that PRT would have been payable for the chargeable period in which PRT last arose—the date when PRT would, in an ideal world, have been repaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 take the latter course. If the Government want to be true to the reasoning that underlies their initital proposal, they should grasp amendment No. 139 as a friendly amendment that maintains a consistently logical and reasonable position, given the anomaly that would otherwise arise. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply on this point, because it is well-founded and should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) makes a cogent case that the existence of PRT repayments arising from the carryback of PRT loss is anomalous, because the expenditure has only just been undertaken and arises because there is a carryback.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The oil industry has put a sophisticated and elegant argument to the Government that PRT interest roughly matches the extra cost that the industry has incurred as a result of paying tax upfront and having to put aside for abandonment notional sums in capital-certain assets that do not yield as much as the money would if it were reinvested in the oil industry. By a happy coincidence—or otherwise—the two match.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not the Committee is convinced by those elegantly presented arguments, it is a fact that the existence of PRT interests has been built into the tax system for a long while and companies have operated in that expectation. There has been no guarantee that that will continue, but companies have had that expectation as well as the knowledge that later they will have to pay abandonment expenditure. They feel that they would be unfairly affected if the intention of the amendment were fulfilled and they were deprived of the right to claim PRT interest in this form. The Government have limited themselves to putting a cap on PRT interest so that the cost of abandonment to oil companies is not 100 per cent, or possibly evenmore, of the amount covered by tax relief and PRT interest combined. We have prevented that happening by means of the PRT cap. Although I agree that it would be possible to design a tax system without PRT interest, I suspect that any advantage would be balanced out by other differences in the tax system. The arrangement introduced in these clauses is as far as the Government wish to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would help the Committee if I described the history of such companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possile for a company to be resident and taxable in the United Kingdom and, according to a different
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
test, also to be resident in another country. In the main tax avoidance cases of the 1980s, the normal procedure was for a company to be incorporated in the United Kingdom because it is centrally managed and controlled here, and also resident in the United States because it is incorporated there, usually in Delaware. That does not mean that the profits of such companies could be taxed twice, which was covered by the double taxation treaty between the United States and us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it meant that losses could be relieved twice. The double taxation treaty did not—and still does not—stop excessive relief being given. Companies could be set up when a United States company wanted to purchase a United Kingdom company; and borrowing for the purchase would be taken out in the dual resident company. By way of relief the interest could be offset against the profits of the other United Kingdom companies in the group. For a consolidated return, the interest could be offset against the profits of other United States companies or others in the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided that the group had enough United Kingdom and United States profits, relief for interest paid could be obtained at 98 per cent in the early 1980s—52 per cent in the United Kingdom, and 46 per cent in the United States. That surely makes trans-Atlantic takeovers one of the most lucrative of business ventures. When companies boast that they are doing well "over there" as well as "over here", we can see why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall provide a summary of one scheme designed for tax avoidance that has been marketed around the City quite recently by a Dutch bank—the Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) International Services Company—registered in Dublin, Ireland. The bank's summary of the proposal that it is putting before the City of London is as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This document outlines an investment proposal from the UK through an Irish financial services centre structure (IFSC) which provides a very attractive after tax margin to the investor up to 2.94 per cent depending upon investment currency. The investment can be unwound prior to agreed maturity in the event of tax changes in Ireland or the UK undermining the economics of the investment."</p></blockquote>
In other words, investment is structured in such a way that it is tax-efficient and nothing else. The bank goes on to explain:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The essence of the proposal is that UK investors are asked to capitalise a company incorporated in the UK. The company has dual resident tax status—Ireland and the UK. The company will be managed by ABN in Ireland and will carry on financial activities. Under the management of ABN the company will suffer tax at a rate of 10 percent."</p></blockquote>
How many of us would wish to suffer tax at that rate? Most of us, I suspect:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the terms of the Ireland UK double taxation agreement there will be no further tax to pay. The high return is made possible due to the following combination of reasons. The investor's funding costs are fully tax deductible in the UK against other taxable income and the dividends received from the investment are exempt from UK tax. By virture of being managed by ABN in Ireland and by virture of the ABN IFSC licence the company will be subject to a rate tax of 10 per cent only."</p></blockquote>
It concludes, not surprisingly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would be happy to discuss any queries you have after reading this proposal."</p></blockquote>
This missive came from a Mr. Tony Shanahan and a Mr. Henry Gormley. I hope that the Inland Revenue is among the groups who take them up on their offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
That scheme is not atypical. One would have thought that the Government would have responded to it all before now. In fairness to the Conservative Government, in 1983 the idea of blocking the loophole was under active consideration. The argument was put forecefully to the Government that losses were incurred not by the Treasury in the United Kingdom but in the United States. The same argument was put with equal force to the United States taxation authorities that losses were not mainly incurred in the United States, but by the Treasury of the United Kingdom. It supposedly benefited the United States and the United Kingdom lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By 1986–87 both Governments realised that that was implausible and that the explanations did not match. They tried to block the abuse in the same year. Unfortunately, in 1988 a loophole was partly reopened by accident in a different form when we changed the law on companies' tax residence. From 1988 companies incorporated in the United Kingdom, as well as those controlled and managed here, had to be tax resident in the United Kingdom. That opened up the possibility of companies being regarded as resident in the United Kingdom, by being incorporated here, and as resident somewhere else, by being centrally controlled and managed elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a major difference between pre-1987 and post-1988 dual resident companies. The post-1988 dual resident companies controlled outside the United Kingdom are resident for tax treaty purposes outside the United Kingdom. After 1988 the dual relief for interest loophole—the major loophole used before—was reopened because the 1987 legislation had been drawn widely. Other loopholes have emerged. In several places the United Kingdom tax code allows the taxpayer to undertake effectively tax-free transactions with a United Kingdom resident company, assuming that the tax is rolled over, to be paid eventually by that company because it is United Kingdom resident. If the company is not treated as United Kingdom resident for tax treaty purposes, it might be exempt from tax later when the rolled-over tax becomes payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, the United Kingdom Exchequer must lose out. All the several loopholes should have been spotted when the 1988 legislation was drafted because dual-resident companies were fresh in everybody's mind—certainly in the mind of the Treasury's taxation advisers. Those loopholes are now being closed by clauses 57 to 59. We support that, although we think that the Government took too long to act. Our amendments, which are in three groups of two, would ensure that, given the boundless ingenuity of tax avoiders, there is no possibility of more avoidance mechanisms, apart from those that the Government's phraseology will close up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's test in the Bill is that which is subject to double taxation treaties. We have thought of no way in which an avoidance device is not covered by a double taxation treaty. But it might be possible to devise such a method. The amendments would prevent that. We hope that the Government will take the wider rather than the narrower view. I am certain that their measures are technically correct and are state of the art for tax avoidance. But we should be ahead of the tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
avoiders, instead of one step behind, and ensure that the clause is as prohibitive as it can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are right to clamp down on the loopholes. Other major vehicles of tax avoidance remain. Offshore trusts are still an abused vehicle for imaginative tax planning. The manipulation of capital losses, solely for tax avoidance, is a continuing abuse that should be banned completely. If we are serious about clamping down on tax avoidance—and tax evasion, as the one leads soon to the other—we must ensure that the Inland Revenue is resourced properly and that it has access to specialist services, which are necessary in an increasingly mobile and complex age. There should be international cooperation on the exchange of information between taxation authorities. It is not in the interests of Governments for tax evaders and avoiders to hide behind national sovereignty. We should combine to thwart that. We should monitor the movement of money internationally, and know its orgin and its destination. Until we commit ourselves to those objectives, successive Finance Bill Committees will discuss tax avoidance as we close famous loopholes, 10 years after people have escaped through them. I hope that the Financial Secretary will accept the amendments and also consider the wider issues that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East identified a problem about loopholes. They have not been used and the Inland Revenue does not know of any avoidance to date. The hon. Gentleman set out the purpose of the clause, which is to close loopholes in existing legislation. The hon. Gentleman is worried that there is no solid guarantee that the clause can achieve that and he has, therefore, tabled an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are only two ways in which companies could use the reliefs to transfer gains out of the United Kingdom charge. The first is to transfer the gains to nonresident companies. The second, with which this clause deals, is to transfer gains to a dual-resident company which is regarded as resident in another country for the purposes of a double taxation agreement by which assests are exempted from United Kingdom tax charge. The removal of gains from tax in that case cannot be justified and we are blocking that potential loophole, even though there is no evidence that it is being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked about Dublin. The provisions are an essential pre-requisite for acting against such schemes. Dual-resident companies will be in the same position as any non-resident company taking advantage of a low tax rate in another country. We maintain and publish a list of countries, some of which are qualified in respect of provisions in their law, in which companies can operate without coming within controlled foreign company legislation. That list is kept under continuous and regular review and updated when necessary in the light of changes in the tax provisions of other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East are constructive and meant to be helpful. They are intended to ensure that there are no other avoidance possibilities. I can categorically state that the amendments are unnecessary because existing law prevents the transfer of gains to non-resident companies under sections 267(l)(c), 273 and 272 of the Taxes Act 1970.I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 225, in page 48, line 13, leave out—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to disposals on or after 20 March 1990"</p></blockquote>
and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the company acquiring the asset itself disposes of that asset on or after 20 March 1990 (irrespective of when the disposal to that company was made); provided that where the Board are satisfied that the obtaining of a tax advantage was not the main reason, or one of the main reasons, for the transfer of the asset to that company, subsections (1) and (2) above shall apply only where the disposal to that company occurred on or after 20 March 1990.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 117, in page 48, line 15, leave out subsection (5) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Subsection (3) above shall apply where the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets for the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets (or both) takes place on or after 20 March 1990 always provided that subsection (3) above shall not apply where the acquisition takes place on or after 20 March 1990.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 225 is about something a little different. As I believe that the abuses to be prevented by the clause are iniquitous, I should like to know why the Government are not retrospectively preventing the relief being obtained where the purpose was entirely tax avoidance. We are not seeking to penalise anyone who has handled his affairs in the normal flow of business. However, where arrangements have been made for the purpose of avoiding tax, why should people be allowed to get away with it? Surely we should move back a little in stopping it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon Gentleman knows, clause 57 tightens up the rules for transfers of assets between companies. It prevents capital gains deferral being available where the company receiving the assets is a dual resident in whose hands the assets would be exempt under a double taxation agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
Under clause 57 this change would apply to transfers on or after Budget day 1990. Under amendment No. 225, unless the Revenue was satisfied that tax avoidance was not a motive, it would apply to earlier transfers if the dual resident company receiving the assets disposed of them on or after Budget day. Therefore, the effect would, to a degree, be retrospective. If the amemdment were accepted, relief due under the pre-Budget rules would be denied or withdrawn for transfers that occurred before 20 March and before the changes enshrined in clause 57 were announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unlikely that we could in any circumstances accept any retrospection, for reasons already known to my hon Friends. We are reluctant to legislate retrospectively, and in most cases I believe that Opposition Members support the principle that it is wrong to do so. In this instance, there is no evidence from the Inland Revenue that the pre-Budget position—the one that has been closed off—has been significantly exploited. We are unaware of any particular problems being exploited through the loopholes. Even if there were, it would still be wrong to legislate retrospectively. The Government are always extremely reluctant to do so, which is the reason for my response to the hon Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree generally with the Economic Secretary about retrospective legislation. I am sure that that view is widely shared in all parts of the House. I have a more relaxed views about retrospective legislation when it comes to tax dodgers and tax avoidance or evasion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording of the subsection reflects the general position on roll-over relief. The discretionary power can extend the time limit for replacement of business assets to qualify for roll-over relief.

	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment also is designed to be helpful and constructive and I can give the hon Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East the same reply as I gave him in response to amendment No. 219. The hon Gentleman wishes to ensure that the clause is watertight, but the clause meets the objectives sought by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in subsections (4) to (7) of section 742 of the Taxes Act 1988 ensure that the long-standing provisions to prevent avoidance of tax through the transfer of assets abroad take account of the accrued income scheme which prevents tax avoidance through converting income into capital gains commonly known as bond washing. Without those provisions individuals resident in the United Kingdom could avoid the impact of the accrued income scheme by conducting activities against which the legislation is directed through overseas companies which they control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily acknowledge that the amendment is designed to ensure that the provisions that we are now introducing for dual resident companies are watertight. In outline, the measures introduced in the clause bring dual resident companies which are treated under double taxation agreements as resident in another territory within the measures concerning the transfer of assets abroad. My initial reaction, therefore, is to say that amendment No. 226 is unnecessary to achieve the hon. Gentleman's aim, which is an aim that I fully share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will appreciate that this is an especially difficult part of the tax code, and I should like to consider the matter in more detail over a slightly longer timescale. I believe that the hon. Gentleman tabled his amendment only yesterday. If, as a result of further consideration of amendment No. 226, we decide that the terms of the clause are not sufficiently comprehensive, we shall table an amendment on Report to achieve the result that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's defence is that amendment No. 226 is unnecessary, but its purpose is to ensure that the clause is watertight. We do not wish to damage the Bill and the Minister did not allege that the amendment would do so. The amendment does the reverse; it firmly places in the Bill the definitions that the Government use in legislation elsewhere. The Minister did not say that the amendment was technically deficient and that is not the case. The Minister used the same reason for rejecting the amendment as he used on previous amendments. He said that they were unnecessary and that the legislation was tight enough, but we want the legislation to be absolutely watertight and our amendments are designed with that in mind. I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will consider the matter, but if it comes down to a balance of probabilities and no harm can be done by accepting
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>

I rise in some hope for that modest little amendment, which derives from the eagle-eyed scrutiny of the Bill by the Law Society of Scotland.

The suggestion is that subparagraphs (c) and (d) can safely be removed because they are the only remainig subparagraphs of section 765(1) of the Taxes Act 1988, the other subparagraphs having been deleted in previous legislation.

I hope that I am as lucky with my proposed amendment as the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was with his. It is tabled in the same constructive spirit, as have been all the proposed amendments to this part of the Bill. Clause 60 is anti-avoidance legislation. It will be no surprise to Conservative Members to learn that we support it, as we have supported all anti-avoidance legislation that the Government have eventually produced. However, under the Bill it would be possible for taxpayers to be in the invidious position of accidentally breaking the law if they were uncertain of their tax position when they made the relevant decisions. There are two ways of dealing with that. The Government's way is to use the phrase "reasonable grounds". We suggest something different—pre-clear-ance. We wish the Bill to provide that the Board shall, if possible, indicate whether consent is needed. We are trying to clarify the position for the potential taxpayer before tax becomes due, so that avoidance or evasion does not take place through an accumulation of errors. The amendment is designed to be helpful, not only to the Revenue, although I am sure that it would be, but to honest corporate taxpayers. If it is accepted, corporate taxpayers will know exactly where they stand, whereas under existing legislation there is bound to be an element of uncertainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the amendment was tabled in a constructive spirit, but, alas, my anxiety is that it could lead to additional bureaucracy and paperwork, which neither the hon. Gentleman nor I would wish to see. Before commenting on the amendment, it might help the Committee if I say a few words about the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 60 makes United Kingdom law compatible with the EC capital movements directive by removing a restriction on movements of capital between people resident in the European Community. The directive requires member states, subject to some derogations, to abolish all such restictions by 1 July 1990. We are concerned with the requirement under section 765 of the Taxes Act 1988, for United Kingdom resident companies to have Treasury consent to carry out certain transactions involving the creation, issue or transfer of shares or debentures in a non-resident subsidiary. The clause removes from the scope of section 765 any transaction which is a movement of capital between EC residents covered by the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After 1 July 1990, United Kingdom companies wishing to carry out a transaction which is a movement of capital within the terms of the directive, for which special Treasury consent would previously have been required, will not longer have to seek such consent
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
beforehand. Instead, they will have to give details of the transaction to the Inland Revenue within six months of carrying it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would interpose a clearance procedure so that companies could ask the Inland Revenue, before carrying out a transaction, whether it would be within clause 60, and would merely need to be reported, or whether it would remain within the scope of section 765 of the Taxes Act and, therefore, be a transaction for which consent was required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand that there may be debate about whether a transaction is a reporting or current transaction. For example, people might ask what the definition of a resident is for the purpose of the directive, whether creation of shares is a movement of capital or whether a company resident in an EC member state transferring shares in a non-EC company to another resident in an EC member state is a reporting transaction or a consent transaction. I believe that that was the nub of the amendment spoken to by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, but to clarify his doubts, I advise him that the Inland Revenue intends to issue a statement of practice on matters of that kind. If there are questions on that statement, it will use its best efforts to give advice informally.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to leave clause 60 without flagging the anxiety of many people about capital movements not only between EEC states but inter nationally.

Many people want the Treasury to take a lead in negotiating serious agreements on double taxation and disclosure. That is the only way to stop the flows of illegal drug receipts between banks not only in the EEC, but the USA.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is worried about the laundering of money, so she probably knows that a task force was established to examine the matter by the G7 at its meeting in 1989. Its report included recommendations for the establishment of criminal offences for money laundering, the requirement of customer identification and record keeping in financial institutions and improvements in international cooperation. If, in the light of recent events, the hon. Lady considers that international cooperation is still inadequate, I should be happy to receive her advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcomed the report of the task force that was instigated by the G7 in 1989. While we acknowledge that its recommendations were useful, we are always considering how to improve matters. The hon. Lady referred specifically to the BCCI case, the responsibility for which falls initially on the Bank of England. She will be aware of the recent events that have taken place. nevertheless, I should be happy to consider further advice if she has some available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that, as long as the banking system is allowed to selfregulate in such matters and the EEC does not negotiate effective agreements for disclosure, especially with Swiss banks, we shall continue to see billions of pounds of illegal drug money swilling round international banking system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question follows directly from what my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) said. Under clause 60, the number of transactions that are reported to the Inland Revenue will be restricted. Under the old consent procedure, all transactions were inevitably reported as part of the process of seeking consent, but the clause will restrict the number of transactions that are even reported. That reduction will affect the ability of the regulatory authorities to scrutinise and monitor the general flow of transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not dispute that the Government are right to say that consent under the capital movements directives cannot reasonably be withheld, but why have they chosen gravely to restrict the amount of information that they can obtain about the nature of those transactions? That raises different issues that would be consistent with our obligation under the EEC capital movements directives, but which would considerably increase the power, authority, scope and thrust of our regulatory regimes. They will be weakened considerably by the Government's reducing the number of transactions that require report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not good enough for the Economic Secretary to say that the Government are agains tax avoidance, tax evasion and the laundering of drug money, and that if my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) has any suggestions about how to clamp down
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
on such abuses, she should talk to the Economic Secretary afterwards. We look to the Government, who have ruled for the past 10 years, to take a lead in such matters, if they are serious about opposing such abuses. The Government have control over the resources of the state, not my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. Would that it were otherwise!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary said that he was open to suggestions. Following the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), I have three suggestions to make. If the Economic Secretary is serious about clamping down on abuse, whether tax evasion or the laundering of illegal money, the Government could do three things straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Government could ensure that the tax authorities in Britain, which have responsibility for hunting down such abuses, are properly resourced. They need adequate staff, time to spend on the cases and encouragement to investigate different scams, no matter how complex they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government could be enthusiastic participants in international cooperation on such matters. They seem to have fought shy of that. Whenever international co-operation is suggested, the British Government always say that we have our own banking procedures, our own rules about confidentiality and that they are satisifed that the British tax authorities are not to blame in any way. Those excuses may sound very good to an English Conservative audience, but they go down badly with continental and American tax authorities that want to clamp down on tax avoidance. Indeed, the United States has made far more energetic assaults than anything that has been attempted by the British Government. The Economic Secretary should try cooperating with others on the exchange of information and the identification of bank accounts for which there is no discernible place of origin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Economic Secretary should ensure that all convertible money products, such as bonds, are traceable from their point of origin. There should be no form of convertible note that has an untraceable place of origin and which would carry anonymity. Before Conservative Members try to satirise our suggestion, I must say that we are referring not to the £5 notes of people who sell drugs on street corners but to billions of pounds. If someone suddenly has half a billion pounds in a bank account that had nothing in it the day before, it is reasonable that the taxation authorities, if not the police, should ask where the money came from. That is not so at present, but should be. Instead of the Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is descending into a caricature of his own demagogic style. Many people outside the Committee will reflect carefully on the statement made this afternoon by the Labour Front Bench in the Committee. That statement reflects an extraordinary ignorance of how the international financial markets work. The idea that every country in the world, including countries such as Andorra and Lichtenstein, could be prevented from allowing people in their territories to issue bearer instruments is unrealistic. The only way to enforce a prohibition on British people holding such paper would be to reintroduce exchange controls. We have had a very interesting policy declaration this afternoon from the Labour Front Bench under the guise of demagogy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) graphically described in that most important Labour Front Bench statement a system that used to exist in Britain. Anyone holding any form of bearer security, no matter where in the world it had been issued, was obliged by law to deposit that bearer security with a registered bank. That gave Britian at that time one of the most restrictive exchange rate ratings in the world and the international system suffered as a result. The hon. Gentleman went further than that because he spoke not only of the reintroduction of that restrictive mea-
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
sure. He also spoke wildly about the registration and following of currency movements, which can be done on only one basis. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding said, that can be done only by the introduction of exchange controls. I remember hearing the deputy leader of the Opposition say recently that the Opposition would not reintroduce exchange controls. We now know the true value of that pledge. The Opposition will not reintroduce exchange controls—they will introduce something remarkably similar under a different name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members have deliberately moved away from the point of the debate. If one talks to regulatory bodies in the United States about the problem of illegal capital flows, about tax avoidance, about capital flight and, above all, about drug money going across international frontiers, they evince the same concern as is shown by the Opposition Front Bench about the Treasury's lack of enthusiasm for genuine co-operation. Much more could be done. If only Conservative Members would look at the wider issues. It is all very well talking about the growth of drug abuse and what is happening in Colombia, but removing the means whereby that money is recycled into cash by the big drug cartels would be one of the most important steps we could take against drug abuse here, in the United States and the Third world. I am sorry that Conservative Members are so flippant about that. They should talk, as I have done, to the Federal Reserve and other regulatory authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one time, one could go into banks in the United States where the safe doors could not be closed because there was so much cash that was not documented or accounted for. They have clamped down on that. We, too, have the power to clamp down. We have the power in the European Economic Community to force Swiss banks to have proper disclosure regulations. We should use that power. We should take that initiative, because our fight against the drugs trade depends on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the avoidance of doubt, I must make it absolutely clear that our debate has had nothing to do with the exchange rate, and that the Labour party has no intention whatsoever of reintroducing exchange control. How typical it is that the Labour party should discuss the laundering of drugs money and the Conservative party should reply by raising the issue of exchange control. I am surprised that they did not go on about the balance or payments deficit or interest rates. We have made our views quite clear on the issue of tax evasion, tax avoidance and the laundering of drugs money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see that the hon.

We shall all read 	<i>Hansard</i> with great interest. The hon. Member explicitly confirmed that he was seeking to ban the holding by British residents of bearer instruments. That is an extraordinary statement. It would prevent British residents from holding a range of notes, including the bulk of German ordinary shares. The only way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

would be to impose exchange controls. It is not good enough for the hon. Gentleman to say that he wills the end but that he denies the means. That is a fundamental contradition.

As she may know, when large sums of money suddenly appear in a bank account, the banks have a duty imposed upon them to report that to the authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that a self-regulated duty? Who enforces it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In those circumstances, the bank has that obligation if it has reasonable grounds for suspicion, and there would be reasonable grounds for suspicion if the drug barons deposited billions of pounds in a bank account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the fears, reservations or anxieties expressed by the hon. Lady may be overcome if she reads the draft directive on money laundering from the European Commission that was published in April. The directive's recommendations are broadly consistent with British legislation—the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986—and stem directly from that action taken by the British Government. I hope that the hon. Lady will welcome the general thrust of the draft directive as much as the Government do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall give the directive careful consideration over the next few months. The hon. Lady did not take too kindly to my offer that if she can suggest ways to improve our position I shall listen to what she has to say. The matter is hardly party political, as some have tried to depict it. No British Government—of the Left or the Right—would disagree on the fundamentals.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to discuss these matters under your chairmanship, Sir John. I wish to make some general comments about clause 61 and schedule 9 which it inserts into the Bill. Detailed discussion may best be included under amendment No. 227 and other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 9 deals with the tax treatment of European economic interest groupings—or, as I gather they are affectionately known in the trade, earwigs. The provisions are broadly in line with the Government's press release issued in January this year which included draft clauses for the legislative changes that are now before us. Earwigs have been registerable in the United Kingdom from 1 July 1989. Therefore, the clause and schedule are retrospective. They are legal structures based on European Community law. By means of this provision and provisions in other member states, they will be dealt with similarly throughout the European Community under article 40 of the 1985 regulation which demands that the profits or losses resulting from the activities of a grouping shall be taxable only in the hands of its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members do not demur from that principle. We accept that it is sensible for similar provisions to be made across the member countries of the European Community in this matter. Therefore, we are in accord with the principles that clause 61 and schedule 9 would enshrine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We make one criticism of the Government. Why has it taken them so long to come forward with the provisions set out in the schedule? Their retrospective nature has been necessitated by the fact that we did not discuss the matter under last year's Finance Bill, but are discussing it instead under this year's Finance Bill, with 12 months already having passed since the proper applicability of the provisions. That is unsatisfactory because it means that people were assessable to tax at a time when no one could say precisely what their tax liability would be. In this particular case, liability could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
have been more or less reasonably predicted, so the question may be somewhat academic, but it would have been better if the Government had introduced the provisions last year, rather than this year with retrospective effect. That is a minor criticism. Although it would have been even better, had the provisions been introduced last year, we broadly accept the principles concerned. We have a number of detailed points which I hope that we can make in subsequent debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will reply to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). Will my hon. Friend give us some information on European economic interest groupings? From the hon. Gentleman's comments, I gather that they have been registrable since 1 April last year. What kind of businesses are expected to take advantage of the structure? Are they designed for joint ventures? How many have been registered? Are they registered with Companies house? How many taxpayers are involved? The hon. Gentleman complained that the provisions were introduced late, but I wonder how many people will be affected by them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) for his suggestion that perhaps the detailed debate should be postponed until we reach clauses 77 and 78. There is a slight overlap between what we are debating now and what we shall debate later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) asked how many European economic interest groups have been formed. Our latest information is that there are 60 groupings throughout the Community. Three of them are United Kingdom-registered and one has an establishment registered in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why, as EEIGS could be set up from 1 July 1989, the legislation was not introduced last year or even earlier. It would have been impractical to have legislated for the fiscal aspects in advance of the regulations governing the regulation, registration and formation of United Kingdom groupings. However, our progress in implementing the regulations compares favourably with that made in some other member states to date.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary may have misunderstood me. There are a number of detailed matters relating to schedule 9. My intention was to
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
discuss those in the group of amendments starting with No. 227 which we shall reach shortly and, by a courteous nod of the head, Sir John, you indicated that that might be the best way to proceed. I hope that the Economic Secretary can deal with some of those detailed matters then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) asked the simple and pertinent question: what is an earwig? He is usually expert in such matters, but as he did not receive an explanation from the Economic Secretary, let me give a reasonably usuable definition:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"EEIGs are an optional form of joint business entity for businesses seeking to cooperate internationally. This may be for any purpose, such as joint research or marketing, or one-off ventures. Any business, whether partnership, company or sole trader, can join an EEIG; the only requirement is that all members are based in the European Community and representatives are included from at least two member states."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman as succinct a definition of an earwig as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earwigs are in a relatively embryonic state. Not many have been established and few are based in the United Kingdom, but I suspect that their use will increase over the years. Obviously, it is correct to get their tax treatment right as early as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Inland Revenue's powers to demand information about an earwig are drawn widely in paragraph 2 of schedule 9. The Opposition believe that the Inland Revenue should be able to require the necessary information to make a proper tax judgment about the affairs of an individual or a company. Amendment No. 127, as well as some of the other amendments in this group, relate to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule is unnecessarily wide. The amendments provide options for drawing it more tightly. Amendment No. 227 is the best mechanism for achieving a sensible solution without intruding too greatly on the privacy of the companies involved. Some of the other amendments suggest that the power to demand information should be limited to the information required in relation to a United Kingdom tax return. The Opposition believe that that perhaps draws the net too tightly as it would not necessarily provide information relevant to the international operation of an earwig.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's proposal is more moderate. It requires that the information demanded by the inspector must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonably required … in order to determine the liability to tax of each member of the grouping."</p></blockquote>
Our test for a demand for information would not be a test of comparison with other parts of the United Kingdom tax system, but a test on a specific basis of what is required to assess properly the tax liability in any instance. That is flexible enough to ensure that the right information can be demanded by the Inland Revenue. Nonethelesss, it places a duty of reasonableness on the board, which is slightly less sweeping than the provisions in the schedule. I commend amendment No. 227 to the Committee. We understand what other amendments would achieve, but we think that our amendment is a little better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have five short and specific points to which I hope, the Economic Secretary will be able to respond. First, the schedule extends only to direct taxes, which are corporation tax and income tax. Is that a deliberate Government policy decision or are any European Community discussions taking place about whether a regime of fiscal transparency for VAT, customs duty, stamp duty and so on is likely to be devised? A note of the current state of any such discussions would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, specifically for the United Kingdom, will the abolition of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax on transfers of shares or securities apply to interests in an earwig?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the schedule does not deal with the ancillary aspects of direct tax law. The Government's press release, which announced the changes included in the schedule, made it clear that PAYE and national
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
insurance contributions would have to be operated by an earwig. It is right that that should be so, but if an earwig is dominated by non-United Kingdom resident partners, can it still be a non-resident employer for schedule E purposes, thereby allowing 100 per cent relief if all the duties of a contract are carried out overseas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, does an earwig that is dominated by non-United Kingdom resident partners, need to withhold basic rate income tax from the annual interest that it pays? Fifthly, if an earwig pays such interest, which double taxation treaties apply—those between the country to which the payee belongs and the earwig's country of establishment, or those between the payee's country and those of the earwig members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) has been moved to come to the defence of badgers with the Protection of Badger Setts Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the gentle warning from my hon Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) but were I to stop talking about earwigs, I should have to start talking about European economic interest groupings. That is more of a mouthful and also more of an earful than the acronym that I have decided to use. That does not detract from the need to decide which double taxation treaties apply, because knowing what tax exchanges are likely to take place between which Governments in the operation of an EEIG would be important if tax were withheld at one end of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are five questions which the Government must clarify. Amendment No. 227 deals with the power to demand information. We feel that the Government's powers are too sweeping. A test of reasonableness would allow flexibility, by giving the Revenue the powers that it needs but also, where necessary, protecting privacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) suggested, the information gathering powers are wide ranging. Some people have called them draconian. The amendments that I have tabled would reduce them to a more appropriate scale by approximating the regime to that which obtains in United Kingdom taxation for partnerships. I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why it is necessary to go beyond that level of information requirement. If, because of fear of tax evasion, there is a need for the Revenue to obtain more information, there would always be the option of recourse to the appeal commissioners, as there is in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
case of United Kingdom partnerships. Approval could then be sought for further information to be demanded. That option would be available even if the Bill were amended. In the circumstances, will the Minister say why the wide-ranging powers set out in schedule 9 are necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be establishing an all-party alliance on this issue. The hon Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) rightly said that the misgivings behind amendments Nos. 12 and 11, which are in my name, are precisely the same as those which underpin his amendment No. 227 and the amendments tabled by the hon Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). There is widespread unease at the wide powers given to the inspector under schedule 9 to demand the required information. Amendments Nos. 12 and 11 seek to achieve the correct balance between the state's powers of enforcement and the rights of the citizen of that state. I accept the contention of the hon Member for Islington, South and Finsbury that there can be genuine differences of opinion about what an appropriate balance is and how best it can be implemented in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested in my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary's response to the amendments. The misgivings that inform them mirror exactly those identified by the hon members for Islington, South and Finsbury and for Berwick-upon-Tweed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is in broad agreement about the virtues of EEIGs but the hon Members who have tabled the amendments are uneasy about the powers that they believe would be given to the Revenue. The amendment's real target is the Revenue's administration of the tax affairs of these groupings in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The misgivings of the hon. Members for Islington, South and Finsbury for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) are unfounded. I shall try to explain why. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and I considered whether powers going beyond what hon. Members and we would wish were being written into the Bill. We concluded that that was not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood would place new restrictions on the Revenue in issuing tax returns. For non-United Kingdom groupings, a member's obligation would be limited to returning details relevant to establishing only his own United Kingdom tax liability. Amendments Nos. 145 and 147, tabled by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, would amend the requirement for tax returns as they apply to EEIGs so that they do not require an EEIG to send any statements that may be required by the Revenue to compute liability. The Revenue could therefore seek only a completed tax return and the EEIG's accounts, not any supporting statements. I can assure the Committee that its misgivings about the powers of the tax inspector, as shown by these amendments, are unfounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not giving inspectors wide new powers without proper checks and balances, as some have feared. These provisions are about administration rules on tax returns—the ordinary standard tax returns that are
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
sent to millions of taxpayers to complete each year. These provisions do not give the inspector any powers to call for additional or special information in a specific case. The inspector has quite separate powers, under existing provisions, which include his own checks and balances. The only power given to the inspector under these provisions is to decide whether a grouping, or in some cases a member of the EEIG, should be sent a tax return to complete in the normal way. As with other tax returns, these are standard forms that have to be approved by the board of Inland Revenue and then published, to make the detail of what is required freely available before they are brought into use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will agree that that is reasonable. It is also reasonable that, where a grouping has neither an official address nor a registered establishment in the United Kingdom, the Revenue should be able to go to any member of the grouping to obtain details of income that is assessable in the United Kingdom as members of the grouping. That, of course, corresponds to existing rules for partnerships, and is on the same lines as other European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed what the Economic Secretary has said. He has been trying to give us an assurance that there is no cause for us to worry that more information will be demanded than is normally appropriate to United Kingdom procedures, but paragraph 2 of the schedule is extremely wide. The information demanded will be that appropriate to a notice issue. The definition of notice is also wide. The contents of the notice and the appropriateness of the information demanded are at the discretion of the Revenue. The Government may not have intended to draw the provision excessively wide, but the wording of the schedule on pages 136 and 137 of the Bill gives more discretion to the Revenue than does current United Kingdom procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That is certainly not my reading of the schedule, for the reasons that I explained to the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed. The tax return provisions in schedule 9 mirror as closely as possible the general provisions about tax returns from individuals, partnerships and companies that appear in sections 8,9 and 11 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. The intention is that the provisions for grouping should match what is done for the general body of taxpayers. The hon. Gentleman should agree that such consistency in tax returns is desirable for the sake of simple and efficient tax administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That being the Economic Secretary's view, what is wrong with amendment No. 146 and the further pursuit of the principle that the provisions should be the same as those which apply to partnerships in the United Kingdom? It is unnecessary to state in the Bill that they should correspond? I doubt that. Why is the Bill not worded in roughly that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be appropriate to deem, as the amendment tries to, every grouping to be a partnership carrying on a trade or profession, and its members as partners regardless of what the grouping does. It is one thing for schedule 9 to deem a grouping that actually carries on a trade to be a partnership, which is done by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
new section 510A(6) of the Taxes Act 1988, but it is going too far to deem every grouping to be trading. That would fly in the face of the view of the Commission, the industry and the professions that most groupings will be non-trading in that they will provide ancillary services such as research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's wording follows that of new sections 8 and 9 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. That is consistent with the intention of applying the same obligations to groupings as apply to the general body of taxpayers. I have tried to alleviate the hon. Gentleman's doubts about that part of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 148 seeks to put beyond doubt the power of an inspector to investigate effectively a grouping when he believes that he holds insufficient information about its tax liability, or that of its members to make an appropriate assessment. It works by extending the list of classes set out in section 20(6)of the Taxes Management Act 1970 that are to be treated as "the taxpayer" to serve notice upon them or third parties to produce information relevant to their tax liability.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's reason for tabling the amendment. The Government do not intend to create an entity that would be immune from the inspector's legitimate power to carry out a proper investigation if he was dissatisfied with the tax return. The amendment is unnecessary. There is no question but that section 20 information powers are available when needed to deal with members' shares in the income or gains of the grouping and the grouping itself where, as an employer, it is liable for tax. To add groupings and their members to the list, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, could throw doubt on other cases that are treated as taxpayers under section 20 without being explicitly mentioned. Section 20(6) is merely illustrative. I hope that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed shares my view that listing the grouping and its members would serve no real purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 227, tabled by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, seeks to limit the information that may be considered to be reasonably required by the Inland Revenue with the return form to determine the tax liability of each member of the grouping. The amendment is unnecessary, because the same effect is achieved by the opening words of the subsection that provides that the return form and the information is restricted to assessing income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. The amendment focuses on the tax affairs of the members rather than the EEIGs in general. The provision deals with standard tax returns of groupings in general—the information may be reasonably required to determine the tax liability of members. It does not, as implied by the amendment, deal with specific requests for information about the tax affairs of a particular EEIG.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked five specific questions. First, he asked about direct taxes. Article 40 of the EC regulation tackles only direct taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Economic Secretary misunderstood me. I was not asking about the current
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
position, which he has stated correctly, but whether any European discussions were endeavouring to broaden the transparency of tax beyond direct taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is none, as far as I know. His second question was whether the abolition of stamp duty applied to interests in an EEIG. The answer to that is no. Normal tax rules will apply. Fiscal transparency under the regulations does not operate for those purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third question was about PAYE and national insurance, and whether a person could be a non-resident employer for non-residential purposes. He drew the Committee's attention to a recent press release and the inference of the hon. Gentleman's question was why the legislation was silent on PAYE. The European regulation is specific in confining fiscal transparency to the charging of tax in respect of income and gains. The preamble to the regulations makes it clear that, for other tax purposes, the national law will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need to say anything special about the provisions of the Taxes Act 1988, which are concerned with other matters such as the deduction of tax. For those purposes, the normal tax rules will operate. For example, when appropriate, a grouping will be required to operate PAYE and deduct tax at source on payments of interest and other annual payments. In certain circumstances, however, the deduction of tax applies on payments to non-resident entertainers, sportsmen and subcontractors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fourth question was whether members would receive relief when an EEIG pays interest or other annual payments. The answer is yes. Fiscal transparency will ensure that, when a grouping pays interest or makes other annual payments, the appropriate share of the payments will be treated as charges on the income of the member in computing the member's own liability to tax. When relief on the payments depends on tax having been deducted, the tax deducted by the EEIG will be treated as tax deducted by the members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's final question was whether EEIGs would be dealt with under double taxation agreements. There were two consultation exercises. The first took place last year and the subsequent exercise took place in January of this year, when a draft clause was published. At that time, both sides recognised that groupings did not fit easily or readily into double taxation agreements. In broad terms, the interaction of the principle of transparency with the provisions of treaties drawn up along the lines of an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model will ensure that groupings are not entitled to treaty benefits in their own right. We all agree that that should be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it should not follow that the income and gains of EEIGs fall outside the protection of treaties altogether. The appropriate inference is that members of EEIGs should qualify for the treaty benefits appropriate to their respective shares in the income and gains of the specific grouping. Whether that result is achieved depends on the wording of the treaty in each case.

	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
I concede that the technical issues are not straightforward—I only wish that they were. Nor are they confined to the United Kingdom. They stem from the legal nature of EEIGs. Other member states will face and are already beginning to face similar difficulties, as will countries outside the European Community where some groupings may operate. However, it is necessarily the case that the tax treatment of groupings in the international context can be resolved only through discussions with treaty partners. The Revenue has had initial contact with fiscal authorities in other member states, the Commission and our major trading partners outside the Community and we have found some support for our views there. However, the discussions are still at a very early stage and the Government will continue to try to clarify these matters and establish the guiding general principles in this detailed, technical and complex area. I hope that with the help of some useful notes that were passed to me during the debate I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point that has emerged from the debate on amendment No. 227 which was tabled by the hon Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). I understood my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to say that the amendment was unnecessary because the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"in order to determine the liability to tax of each member of the grouping"</p></blockquote>
were effectively covered in the proposed section 12A(2) by the words
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of making assessments to income tax".</p></blockquote>
The advantage of the hon. Gentleman's amendment is that it includes the word "reasonably". There is at present no reference to reasonableness anywhere in the measure and whether or not the Inland Revenue requires information is subject to a subjective test. The advantage of including the word "reasonable" somewhere would be that it would be subject to an objective test and that would be an improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rare for me to find myself in agreement with my namesake on the Conservative Benches. He has identified the point that I was going to raise about the Economic Secretary's comments. The wording
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of making assessments to income tax"</p></blockquote>
could cover almost anything. I do not accept the Economic Secretary's argument that the inclusion of that preamble to the subsequent provisions of the proposed subsections (3) to (7) limits the Inland Revenue's
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
discretionary scope to demand information beyond what might be deemed to be reasonable. The test of reasonableness under our amendment would render the Inland Revenue's powers rather less sweeping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury to know that we shall be proposing under clause 77, with which there is some overlap, that the Inland Revenue should publish a binding statement of practice outlining the criteria that it will apply in designing the tax returns. The board of Inland Revenue is bound by law to act reasonably in these matters and the statement of practice can be tested in the courts if it is an unreasonable exercise of its powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposal is meant to be constructive. It is a worthwhile safeguard, and I hope that it reasures the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After relentless questioning of the Minister, we have wrung from him a valuable concession. He was less than usually robust in resisting my amendment earlier and I welcome the statement that he has now made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We appear to have extracted a clear commitment from the Minister that the provisions of clause 77, which we shall discuss in due course, will apply and that any code of practice issued under them will apply to the treatment of EEIGs as set out in the schedule. That is welcome news and, if it is the case, answers questions asked on both sides of the Committee. We await with interest to see what emerges in relation to clause 77.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
