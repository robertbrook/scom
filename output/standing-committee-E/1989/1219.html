<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AND COMMUNITY CARE BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and question proposed,</i></p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>That at its rising this day the Committee do adjourn till Tuesday 9th January and that with effect from that day it do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock —<i>[Mrs. Virginia Bottomley]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael<span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. I seek your advice. In the list of members of the Committee, my name is written as Welsh surnames were centuries ago: my Christian name is given as my surname. I should be grateful if that could be corrected.<br><br>
I seek your advice, Dame Janet, on a more serious matter relating to Wales and the position of the Secretary of State for Wales in the Bill. There has been confusion before: you will recall a previous Bill under your chairmanship, Dame Janet, when I raised a similar point. In the Bill, the Health Service in Wales is subsumed within English procedures and there is likely to be confusion about the position and functions of the Secretary of State for Wales. I seek your guidance because the Health Service is precious to the people of Wales and confusion will cause difficulty and lead to objections. Its position in the Bill is not clear. I raise the matter now because the point cannot be made effectively during discussion of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Strictly, that is not a point of order for the Chairman. I suggest that when it is appropriate - during the consideration of clauses or amendments - the Gentleman raises the matter at the first convenient moment. It can then be disposed of for the rest of the Bill. Beyond that, as Chairman, I cannot help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook<span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by saying how delighted I am that we are to spend the next two months together, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Not alone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I shall be chaperoned. I shall be pleased to rise to speak when you call me, Dame Janet, whichever way round you put my name. I hope that it will assist in future contretemps when I say that I am relieved that we are to be guided through our proceedings by your wisdom and tact.<br><br>
The motion is one that would not have been put to the first sitting of a Committee when you and I first came into the House, Dame Janet. When I arrived in the House 15 years ago, it was usual for the sittings motion to prescribe morning sittings only. In extremis, after the passage of time, there was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
a second sittings motion prescribing an afternoon sitting. During this Government's period of office, that custom and practice has changed, although they began by following it. The interval between the two motions shortened, and in the past two or three years there has been a mere two-week formality before the Government reach for the second sittings motion. We have now arrived at the logical extension of that process: at the Committee's first sitting, we are confronted with a sittings motion which rolls into one the two sittings motions and obliges us to have afternoon sittings from the first week after the Christmas recess.<br><br>
There are other changes, with which my hon. Friends will be familiar. I was a Member of Parliament at the time of the Labour Government, and you will recall, Dame Janet, because it was an experience that you shared, that it was regarded in those days as a mark of failure for a Minister and a Government to have to impose a guillotine to get a Bill through the House. These days, any pretext will do to reach for a guillotine; quite the reverse. Nowadays, Ministers use any pretext to impose a guillotine, and far from regarding it as a mark of failure, they regard it on the contrary as an irritation to be forced to permit scrutiny of a Bill through to its end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell<span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) for giving way, and I defer to his greater experience in the House, but it is on record that the right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot) introduced five guillotine motions in one day. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that there is some unique and novel iniquity on the part of this Government is somewhat inapposite, and I would like to get on with the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. Before we continue, I remind the Committee that no guillotine motion is in the air at present, and while it is in order to make a passing reference to it, it should not become a subject of debate or it will be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am guided by your advice, Dame Janet. I will make only a passing reference to it - indeed, by now I should have passed off it - but may I continue to make my point? If Ministers have it in mind at some future date to present us with a timetable motion, they will receive no assistance from Opposition members of the committee in making the case for that guillotine. I want to make it clear that we shall subject the Bill to rigorous scrutiny, but we shall do so without wasting time and without filibuster, and I can tell the Minister of State that she will get the motion within about an hour. We are anxious to be able to debate the Bill to its end without guillotine, and in particular, to examine the important clauses on community care which are tucked at the back of the Bill.<br><br>
It may assist the Minister and her hon. Friends to know the strategy that we propose to adopt during the Bill's proceedings. We regard the Bill as a measure of fundamental importance, as, I am sure, you do, Dame Janet. It represents the most profound change in the National Health Service since 1948. It will transform a social service that is there to treat need into a business enterprise that will be chasing trade. It is put forward by a Government whose only political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0337">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
value is the value for money, and who are so bound by ideology that the only way that they see of securing value for money is by introducing competition. Conservative Members are incapable of understanding why so many people in the Health Service reject their proposals, but it is because they understand that a combination of co-operation and teamwork is a better way of serving the patient than competition against one another.<br><br>
We attach great importance to the Bill. We shall scrutinise it rigorously clause by clause, but I want to signal at this preliminary stage that our strategy will focus on six key issues by which we shall test Ministers' willingness to listen to complaints from outside the House and inside the Committee. First, we shall press that no hospital shall be permitted to enter into a self-governing trust and leave the local NHS authority without a ballot of local people. We shall propose, first, a ballot of the patients it serves - the Government tell us, after all, that patients must come first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Couchman<span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. It appears to me that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is straying to the substance of the Bill and away from the sittings motion. He is making a well worn speech that we have heard on a number of occasions, and we are aware of his views on the matter. Perhaps we can discuss the sittings motion rather than the substance of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Yes. That thought was passing through my mind, but I like to be sure of the drift before I intervene. But I think that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is straying somewhat from the terms of the motion. During consideration of amendments and clauses there will be ample opportunity to define the strategy. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member to return more closely to the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am happy to be guided by you, Dame Janet. I welcome your assurance that there will be ample opportunity to explore those points, which we shall certainly do.<br><br>
We shall also watch closely how the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) responds to the key issues. I assure him that this sitting and this committee will not pass in silence. The NHS will not be mugged in a back street. Our proceedings will be highly visible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. I apologise to the Committee, but this is a genuine point of order, somewhat prompted by the reference by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) to being heard in silence. He and Opposition Members generally may not know that it is already relatively difficult to hear their speeches, which we would like to hear and debate. That may well be related to the geography of the Committee Room. It is an excellent and large Committee Room, but it occurs to me that, unless I am in need of NHS services, if I find it relatively difficult to hear from where I sit, people in the Public Gallery may find it extremely difficult to do so. Through you, Dame Janet, I therefore counsel all Committee members to speak up as much as possible.<br><br>
I notice that Opposition Members have adopted what used to be called in the trade the doughnut but, in this instance, they have put themselves all together in what I can only describe as the slab-chocolate formulation - <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Member's first point was valid; his other remarks were not a point of order: they are irrelevant and undesirable.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's first point was about being heard. I have chaired Committees in this Room before and know that there is a problem for any Member more than halfway down the Room, and sometimes for people listening in the Public Gallery. The point is well made that it is most important to speak as clearly as possible. I understand that the microphones suspended above our heads are for the purpose of recording for <i>Hansard,</i> not for amplifying our voices. Perhaps that could be borne in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Thank you, Dame Janet. I am distressed at the thought that Conservative Members might miss any part of my speech. I shall seek to proceed with such speech as I am allowed-between interruptions.<br><br>
As I was saying, we shall ensure that our Committee proceedings are widely transmitted- and not merely through the broadcasting media - to the nation; and we shall watch how Conservative Members respond to our key issues and amendments. I assure them that should the television cameras fail in any future sitting to capture their votes, we shall ensure that those votes are fully reported to their local papers and radio stations and to their constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker<span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:Just so that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is quite clear about this, I should say that I am never ashamed of my votes in this House. I am very happy for my constituents to know how I vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. Before the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) continues, I should say that I see only a very thin connection between this point and the sittings motion. I remind him that he must deal with what we are supposedly considering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I have been tempted astray by the many interruptions in my speech. Indeed, given the interruptions that we have already heard, I am beginning to think that the Government's strategy is to go for a guillotine motion by filibustering their own Bill.<br><br>
The significance of the sittings motion is that it clearly signals that the Government intend to try to get the Bill through Parliament as swiftly as they can. Last night, I heard that health authorities have been advised that they can expect Royal Assent not in July, as originally notified to them, but by May. If that is so, it suggests that we shall have much difficulty in finding adequate time to do justice to the Bill -without filibustering, without wasting time, and without the spurious points of order that we have already heard, none of which has been raised by the Opposition. We shall perform our scrutiny by concentrating on the issues in the Bill without wishing to waste time.<br><br>
10.45<br><br>
However, if the Committee is to do its job properly it will require an adequate number of weeks in which to complete its scrutiny of the Bill. Perhaps I may briefly return to my earlier point. There is enormous interest in the Bill on the part of those outside, including the organisations that work in, and represent the people who work in, the Health Service. There is considerable interest in the Bill's concluding
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
clauses on the part of voluntary organisations which work and provide services in the community and which are frequently praised by Ministers. They will all wish to lobby the Committee. They will require time to marshal their arguments and to express them to the Committee. They will not wish the Committee to dispose of the Bill in unreasonable haste.<br><br>
The Bill has created enormous interest among the wider public. We are dealing with a measure not only of great importance but of almost unique unpopularity. The Government have frequently proposed unpopular measures in Committees in this Corridor, but this one is distinguished by the fact that not only has it no popular support but that those who propose it in Committee have no mandate to introduce it.<br><br>
However long we are allowed to debate the Bill, by the end of our proceedings, when stumps are pulled, we shall have sought to challenge the profound damage that the Bill will do to the Health Service and the social services. We shall have exposed the hollow commitments of Ministers to patients and we shall have impressed, even on Conservative Members, how unpopular the proposals are, even in their constituencies. We shall perform that task with enthusiasm and energy, with the confidence that comes from knowing that the people agree with us. Whatever the outcome of ballots in this Committee, when the Bill is put to the final ballot of the next general election, we can look forward with confidence to victory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours<span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:Before I begin my comments, Dame Janet, I should like to say a few words about Mr. Laurie Pavitt who, as you may know, died last Thursday. He was a veteran campaigner on social services issues. Indeed, if he had been a Member of the House today, he would have been a member of this Committee. He sat on most Bills dealing with the Health Service. I am sure that both sides of the House recall him with great affection because he played such a notable and noble part in its proceedings.<br><br>
We are debating the sittings motion, so in principle, one is to argue against the proposition that the Committee should meet four times a week, as opposed to twice. I have some very good arguments which I think the Committee should consider before a vote is taken on the motion.<br><br>
I sit on three Select Committees, one of which is the Public Accounts Committee, which meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, and another of which is the Select Committee on Members' Interests, which meets on Tuesdays. It is clear that our meetings on Tuesday afternoons would overlap with Committee proceedings in another Room on matters of great interest to me. Plainly, Members only have so much time in a week, yet there are many documents and representations that I shall wish to consider.<br><br>
Those of us who represent the north-west have spent the past month weeding through mountains of correspondence from constituents complaining about the implications of the Bill. From Crewe to Carisle, from Wythenshawe to Workington, from Bolton to Barrow, there are tens of thousands - if not millions - of people who strongly resent those implications and the inevitable damage that they believe that they will do to the Health Service in their areas. They not only want but demand that the Bill be considered fully by Members of Parliament. It must not be driven
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
through the Commons under some form of crash programme, in which amendments are not properly considered and - far worse - not given time for the thought that they need; the right decisions must be taken by the Committee, because the Bill has long-term implications that affect everyone in the United Kingdom who chooses to use the National Health Service, as opposed to buying his way round the system and using private health care, if he can afford it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe<span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:May I help to assuage the hon. Gentleman's anxiety? When we were debating the closed shop, we heard a number of his colleagues describing, with almost equal elegance, the enormous anxiety that was felt by their constituents. As the hon. Gentleman will realise, the removal of the closed shop has become official Labour party policy, and I feel sure that a similar Labour party response will follow once this Bill has been enacted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:All I can say in response to the hon. Gentleman, who represents a constituency in Kent - an area of great interest to me, in that I have spent quite a lot of time there campaigning on these very issues - is that at meetings in constituencies near his I heard nothing but anger about the prospects that the Bill holds for the future of his constituents. At the most recent meeting in Sevenoaks, 500 people turned up to hear another hon. Member and me speak on Health Service matters, and there was outrage on the part of the audience.<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I fear that the debate is now straying to the substance of the Bill and way from the sittings motion. Has the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) completed his remarks on the sittings motion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Nearly. The Public Accounts Committee, on which I sit, has produced a series of reports -Financial Management in the National Health Service, Hospital Building in England, The National Health Service: Coronary Heart Disease, Use of Operating Theatres in the National Health Service, Quality of Clinical Care in National Health Service Hospitals, Competitive Tendering for Support Services in the National Health Service, NHS: Control over Professional and Technical Manpower, and The National Health Service: Control of Nursing Manpower. All those reports should be considered by Members before we even begin to discuss the Bill.<br><br>
I put it to you, Dame Janet, that very few Conservative Members even know of the existence of those reports, yet unless the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and his hon. Friends read them, they are not in a position fully to appreciate the impending damage that the Bill will do if passed by the Committee. I maintain that the reports should be on the agenda, and until they are discussed, there is no basis on which the Committee can proceed. These reports, which come from the National Audit Office but are accompanied by reports from the Public Accounts Committee, are carried, invariably unanimously, by an all-party Committee of the House of Commons which comprises Members of all political persuasions, and none of the reports points in any way in the same direction as the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy<span class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:My

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
concern about the sittings motion is different from that of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), and it arises specifically from the Scottish content of the Bill. I notice that we have on the Conservative Benches of the Committee both the Minister who is responsible for health matters in Scotland and the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) who, true to character, has already made his presence felt in an intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook).<br><br>
The sittings motion, one assumes, shows that the Government do not intend to have separate Scottish debates on the content of the Bill. It would appear that the Scottish clauses are to be tagged on to their English counterparts, despite the different needs and nature of the Health Service north and south of the border.<br><br>
Broader points would, I fear, stray wide of the motion, but I wish to raise one issue which I know will be echoed by colleagues in Scotland and on this side of the Committee. Had we a democratically elected Scottish Parliament, a motion of this nature would be more acceptable, because it would allow proper scrutiny of the Scottish dimension of the Bill. One suspects, nevertheless, that even with a democratically elected Scottish body, a Bill such as this would never see the light of day in Scotland.<br><br>
In my view, it is a constitutional disgrace - certainly it is a political disgrace - that, again, the Government have shown scant regard for Scottish aspirations and sensitivity, that aspects of the Health Service which relate specifically to Scotland -1 hope that the matter will be clarified either by you, Dame Janet, or by a Minister at the end of this short debate - are to be tagged on to their English counterparts, and that any hopes about those Scottish aspects will be determined by an English Conservative majority. Their decisions will bear little resemblance to health policy in Scotland. The English Conservative block vote is to be wheeled in by the Government to avoid the practical embarrassment of having only two Scottish Members in this Committee - who, I suspect, may be tied up in other Scottish legislation as the Session continues - and the political embarrassment of the extreme isolation of the Scottish health Minister, wearing his other hat as chairman of the Scottish Tory party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett<span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I have been watching with some concern the change in Liberal party policy over the past few years towards wanting to break up the Union, but I wonder why the hon. Gentleman did not complain when the Labour Government and all the legislation that they introduced were sustained only by Labour Members and Liberal Members in Scotland; there was no majority in England for any of the policies of the Labour Government. The hon. Gentleman did not complain then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I wonder how that relates to the sittings motion? I ask the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) not to be led into temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I shall not be so led, but I should explain that I could not have complained 10 years ago because I was not here. That, I think, answers the hon. Gentleman's question.<br><br>
I do not want to stray into details, but perhaps I may be allowed to give one example of the problem that I am
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
attempting to highlight. It is best illustrated by clause 35, which gives the Secretary of State powers to restrict the number of doctors entering general practice. I shall not go into the rights or wrongs of that; in England there may be good reasons for the Secretary of State enjoying such a power, but in Scotland the Government can restrict their numbers without extra powers because of the effects of the GPs' contract. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Scotland acknowledged the problem - and, I assume, thereby made it in order for the Committee to debate the contract - when he announced the decision to make transitional payments to practitioners with small list sizes who, from 1 April 1990, are unable to maintain or improve their income under the new remuneration arrangements without increasing their list size.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying too far from the sittings notion. I ask him to return to it or to resume his seat.</span></p>
<p>11 am.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I wish to highlight a matter to which we shall come later in our proceedings. The situations in Scotland and England are different and distinct and the way in which the Bill is organised in that respect will not permit a proper examination of that important aspect. The issue is central to Scotland, but not so relevant in England. I fear that if the two countries are taken together, as the sittings motion suggests, the Scottish element of the debate will not be given the attention or analysis that it demands.<br><br>
I seek reassurance on that point and shall be interested to know whether any changes are proposed to the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon<span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am deeply concerned that consideration of the Bill might proceed with undue haste: some of my arguments might therefore be outside the sittings motion. We are considering issues of life and death: the Bill takes us back to pre-1948 days, before the National Health Service. We are considering a fundamental change in the ethos of the Health Service. That is impossible within a time constraint which will frighten people even more than they are frightened already.<br><br>
That brings me to my main argument: because the Government are considering a fundamental change in the ethos of the Health Service and because it will be looking at people with a price—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I must interrupt the hon. Lady. Hon. Members of the Government side of the Commmittee should not stand while a member of the Committee is speaking. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] Order. I know from long experience that neither Conservative nor Labour Members have a monopoly on doing things incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>.The ethos will be to put a price on people's heads, instead of considering their need. The Government must allow ample time for the Opposition to examine the Bill line by line. The issues which the Bill does not tackle are as important to the Opposition as those that it does. It will be impossible for us to consider the Bill without considering the endemic underfunding of the National Health Service. My authority is faced with cuts of £500,000 this year and another £700,000 next year. How can we examine such a fundamen-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
tal change in the philosophical approach to the NHS without considering such matters?<br><br>
Dame Janet, you rightly stopped my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), who was outlining our strategy for examining the Bill when he strayed into discussion of ballots and accountability. He asked whether the Government have a mandate to introduce the Bill. They have no mandate whatever: that was proved in my constituency when over 1,000 people who were balloted were overwhelmingly against a philosophical change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Lady reminded me of my strictures to another hon. Member; she must not fall into the same trap.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>.Thank you, Dame Janet.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will reconsider their attitude to the Bill, which they appear to be pushing through with undue haste. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) I, too, have spent time in Kent. People throughout the country are deeply anxious, and none more so than in that county.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz<span class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I echo the sentiments of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) in welcoming you to the Chair, Dame Janet. You and I had the pleasure of spending many days and nights together throughout the country as members of a Select Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman might select his words more carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—and throughout the world. Under your chairmanship, Dame Jane, the Committee will be a combination of tolerance and toughness.<br><br>
I first met the Minister when I was the European candidate for Surrey, West and she was the parliamentary candidate for Surrey, South-West. Our paths did not cross further: she was elected the Member of Parliament for the safe Conservative seat of Surrey, South-West, and I lost Surrey, West by 104,000 votes.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston and others have said, the Bill is a landmark which requires the closest scrutiny. The sittings motion does not allow sufficient time to discuss the Bill or the amendments that will be tabled by Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
Opposition and Back Bench Conservative Members have tabled 132 amendments, but there are no Government amendments yet. In the last Committee on which I sat - its members included the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) - the practice adopted by the Minister's predecessor was to allow the Committee to discuss amendments because they related to issues which caused anxiety. On occasion, the Committee considering the Children Bill was adjourned to allow members on both sides of the Committee to discuss new and important developments.<br><br>
The Bill will affect every man, woman and child; we must anticipate crucial issues that will arise during the Committee and which Opposition and Conservative Members will need to discuss. The sittings motion will not give us the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
opportunity for such discussion.<br><br>
I declare an interest: in common with other Opposition Members, I am sponsored by the National Union of Public Employees. We receive no money from the union and we are not its spokespersons. However, as we are closely associated with that union, we are in close touch with many people who work in the Health Service. They tell us about their worries. I have had more letters from members of the public on this issue than on any other, apart from the infamous Alton Bill of 18 months ago.<br><br>
We need more time, Madam Deputy Speaker — I am sorry, Dame Janet; perhaps that is a prediction — to take note of the reaction from our constituencies. When my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) came to Leicester recently, she stopped the traffic on the Uppingham road because so many local people wanted to talk to her about the changes that the Bill would introduce. We attended a meeting initiated by doctors, many of whom, astonishingly, declared their political allegiance by saying that they had voted for the Government at the last election but would not do so again because of the Bill. They wished to discuss the proposals at length with my hon. Friend.<br><br>
I ask that the sittings motion be rejected. More time should be given us to participate in discussions throughout the country on this crucial issue.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) was right to say that we need to discuss resources. That does not relate directly to the sittings motion, but we cannot discuss resources or bring to the Committee's attention the various problems which we know about in our constituencies unless we have more time to discuss this crucial legislation.<br><br>
I doubt whether we shall return to this subject for a considerable time - certainly not for the next year and a half, until the next Labour Government are in office. Until then, we should ensure that the Bill, which enables us to discuss the framework of the Health Service for the next year and a half, is given proper time so that we may consider it in an effective and appropriate way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Before I call the next speaker, I should mention that I intend formally to ask any hon. Member who has an interest to declare to do so immediately before consideration of the substance of the Bill — that is, before the first amendment is called.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh<span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I, too, welcome you as the chairman of our deliberations, Dame Janet. You will recall that you and I sat together through the entire Water Bill proceedings and, in comparison, this Bill seems a mere doddle in terms of numbers of clauses. I am sure that we all welcome you to your heavy duties, and we have no doubt that you will keep us very much in order.<br><br>
I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). He may be in a particularly sensitive position, and perhaps we should accede to his request on the sittings motion, because an item in The Guardian diary today may be relevant to our sittings motion. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This could cause a bit of a flutter… An advertisement, appearing in some of India's better newspapers. Wanted: a bride for eligible British politician with own teeth, hair, seat (1,924 majority); also desk at House of Commons; hobbies: tennis and soap operas. Will be available to interview applicants during visit to India in March."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0341">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
well, The Guardian diary asks whether it is the hon. Member for Leicester, East who, it says, is
<br><blockquote><p>"A man whose appeal is such that it stirred the hormones of women unknown when it emerged that he was sitting, all unmarried, on the Commons committee dealing with the Children Bill."</p></blockquote>
I think, Dame Janet, that we should show some sympathy with the hon. Member for Leicester, East, since some of us have been married for many years, and some of us for all too many years.<br><br>
On a serious note, we have been sitting in this Committee for three quarters of an hour and all we have heard from Opposition Members is wingeing about possibly having to sit through the afternoons. Conservative Members believe that the National Health Service is so important that we are prepared to sit in the afternoons and in the evenings. You have had to draw Opposition Members up time and again for verging on being out of order, Dame Janet. Could it be that they do not want to reach the substance of the Bill or to discuss the record infusion of cash into the NHS?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. If I were not reasonably tolerant, the hon. Gentleman would have been pulled up for his irrelevant references to another member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I apologise, Dame Janet. On our first day, and because of the Christmas spirit, I thought that rather than doing my Christmas cards I might help the hon. Member for Leicester, East.<br><br>
Conservative Members are anxious to get to the guts of the Bill. We know that it will give choice to people and help to improve the NHS. Let us get on with the business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe<span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I associate myself with remarks made by various hon. Members when welcoming you to the chairmanship of this Committee, Dame Janet. I had the honour of serving on the Water Bill under your chairpersonship. You were extremely fair. Your integrity shone through every sitting and I have no doubt that it will remain the same in this Committee. Moreover, you must be one of the few people in this place, Dame Janet, who has the integrity, when finding correspondence belonging to another hon. Member in a House of Commons photocopier, to return it to that Member rather than doing other things with it, as has been known to happen.<br><br>
I shall refer to the sittings motion. Most hon. Members' comments, with the exception of those from my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), who opened the debate, referred to the National Health Service component of the Bill.<br><br>
I have received huge amounts of mail from my constituency and a huge batch of cards again today —literally, 6in deep — from people in the Wakefield area and west Yorkshire about their anxieties for the NHS. But tucked away within the legislation are some important provisions relating to the social services and I am worried that the high profile rightly given to the NHS has overshadowed the serious implications of the provisions on community care.<br><br>
I am extremely worried, and predicted in the debate on the Queen's Speech, that our discussions will be guillotined. Seeing the sittings motion today, I am worried that the guillotine will directly affect an issue of the greatest concern to vast numbers of people - community care. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Government have been prepared to hurry through, in an obscenely rapid way, the provisions relating to the social services element in the legislation.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
We all had to wait for the Griffiths report and then we waited for at least 18 months for the Government's response to the important and radical proposals in that report. After that response, between publication of the White Paper and publication of the Bill, we were given three working days in which to consider the White Paper's serious implications. As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston said earlier, vast numbers of people -I suggest, many hundreds of thousands — and many voluntary and statutory organisations will be directly affected by the Bill' s provisions on community care. We should not forget the many informal carers who do the great bulk of caring at home for the elderly and the disabled. They will not be assisted by the provisions. They have been treated with utter contempt by the Government, who want to rush through this legislation.<br><br>
I express my deep concern at how we are being asked to rush through the Bill, effectively on the nod. I suspect that we will proceed even more rapidly on the provisions in parts II and IV, which relate to the serious issues of community care.<br><br>
I remind Committee members that the legislation is about people. It has a direct bearing on some tragic cases about which we should be aware and concerned. I have something in common with the Minister for Health in that we both have a social work background. From her own experience, she will know of the tragic cases that will be directly affected by the legislation. During our proceedings, I shall take great delight in bringing to the Committee's attention many of the tragic cases which I know, from my social work experience and political involvement in west Yorkshire, will be directly affected by the Bill. It will make the role of carers more difficult, whether they are professional carers or informal carers in the home, who constitute the majority.<br><br>
It is inappropriate to discuss the contents of the Bill at this stage. But, in the context of the sittings motion, I am worried about the community care provisions in the Bill. I am worried about a marked deterioration in the ability of people to ensure that the elderly, the disabled, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped are supported and cared for within the community.<br><br>
Under this Government, the trend has been to push these people in the direction of institutional care. The ability of the NHS at local level and of local authorities to support them in the community has been directly undermined by the Government's policies. On Second Reading, I cited the example of Pinderfields hospital in Wakefield. That first-class facility had its younger disabled people's unit threatened with closure as a direct result of the Government's policies. The only way around that has been to reduce the services that it can offer in respite care for assisting people in the community to care for disabled relatives at home. As a direct result of that reduction in respite care, some people have had to go into permanent institutional care.<br><br>
I know that in a moment you will refer me to the sittings motion, Dame Janet. I was trying to show that we should be worried about the provisions on community care. I am deeply worried that those provisions will be lost and not properly evaluated if a guillotine motion is nodded through, which will happen if we agree to the sittings motion.<br><br>
I am anxious because local authorities are finding it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0342">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
increasingly difficult to prevent people going into institutional care. The Wakefield local authority has an excellent record on social services—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The rope of relevance is getting sufficiently long to hang the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:You are correct to bring me to order, Dame Janet. I shall expand on my points at length, given the opportunity, later in our consideration of the Bill.<br><br>
Opposition Members are anxious to ensure that there is a balance in the evaluation of the Bill in Committee between the proposals on the National Health Service and those on community care. I hope to have the opportunity to spend equal time on the proposals that relate to the social services, but I am worried that the motion means that that part of the Bill will be guillotined. I hope that the Minister will assure us that will not be so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am pleased to be able to take up the remarks of the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe). He is an assiduous officer of the parliamentary panel on personal social services, of which I am chairman. I share his anxiety that there should be proper time for discussion of community care but he will not expect me to agree with him on everything that he was allowed to say. I strongly disagree with him on one matter. The Government having been pressed by the entire community care world for months to produce legislation following the Griffiths report, it is hard on us if we are to be assaulted for having introduced it in the first available piece of major legislation. There would be a better chance of our discussing the community care provisions with careful attention if the sittings motion were allowed to pass with less debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley<span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I welcome you to your role as Chairman of the Committee, Dame Janet. I sat on the Committee which considered the Water Bill, of which you were Chairman. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), who has left the Committee, said that this Bill would be a doddle in comparison. It is clear that both pieces of legislation will be the downfall of the Government. I am please to serve on the Committee.<br><br>
As my hon. Friends said, there is massive public anxiety about this legislation. In Manchester, we have had letters from the general public and from consultants, doctors, health workers and every voluntary organisation. They clearly understand the Bill's implications. Despite massive Government propaganda, they are not fooled into believing that the Bill will provide health care to meet people's needs. That is why they charge us with a clear responsibility to spend sufficient time debating the Bill's implications line-by-line.<br><br>
I have received letters from people in Withington and from all over greater Manchester and the north-west. Many have come from the Tory marginal constituencies around greater Manchester such as Stockport, Bury and Bolton. People there expressed their anxiety about the Bill and asked me and other north-west Members to represent their views in opposing the Bill in Committee. That is our responsibility. We intend to ensure their points of view are clearly expressed in Committee. Accordingly, we need time to discuss the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
view that the Bill does not tackle the fundamental issue within their health authorities: the massive underfunding of the Health Service.<br><br>
My health authority has a shortfall this year of £1.5 million. It thus intends to cut services in the two major hospitals in Wythenshawe and Withington. The financial implications of that rationalisation, as it is called, is that in the long term, £1.5 million will be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I have pulled up other hon. Members for straying into matters that do not relate directly to the sittings motion. To be fair, I must do the same to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I appreciate what you say, Dame Janet. My point is that our deliberations must include discussion of that fundamental underfunding. I shall give examples such as that of south Manchester, which I mentioned, to show why the people of Manchester and the north-west believe that the Bill will not tackle that fundamental issue. The Government are not providing the resources to meet the needs of patient care, whether or not there are changes in health care policy.<br><br>
People are anxious about the way in which hospitals are forced to consider opting out because of lack of finance. Consultants and health workers at Christie hospital in my constituency asked me to stress in Committee that they are considering opting out only because the hospital does not have the money to provide the care that is needed.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) said, we need time to consider the implications of community care. The hon. Member for Kent (Mr. Rowe) may say that the Government have introduced legislation on the issue at the first opportunity: we believe that the issue is so important that it needs time of its own to be considered. A separate community care Bill should have been brought forward so that it could be considered separately from the proposals for the NHS. If that had been done, community care could have been given detailed scrutiny at the same time as the changes to the hospital service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Did my hon. Friend note that the hon. Member for Kent (Mr. Rowe) did not undertake to bring before the Committee the representations that he had received from care organisations in Kent? In desperation they are writing to Labour Members of Parliament to ask that the issues are raised in the Committee. Is the hon. Gentleman willing to give that undertaking? As my hon. Friend knows, there are major problems in Kent that are not receiving attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. Interventions should be short and within the rules of debate. Our discussion is going wide of the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Thank you, Dame Janet. I did not intend to go too far into the matter that my hon. Friend raised.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kent (Mr. Rowe) will have to answer to those organisations that have made representations to him—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) may be asked to answer, but not here, and now and not in these circumstances.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I trust that the hon. Gentleman, who probably made clear statements to the organisations, will match his statements to his votes in the Committee, if there is time available to discuss all the issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. Opposition Members seem to be making scarcely-veiled threats about using extra-parliamentary activities to try to embarrass the Government and influence the proceedings of the Committee. It might be for the Chair to suggest that that is not the way in which our business should be conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Chair prefers to take her own decisions. Members of the Committee will be aware that I believe that the discussion is going wider than the terms of the sittings motion. That is as far as I wish to take the matter this morning. There will be no problem if hon. Members stick to what they should be talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I shall conclude my remarks, Dame Janet, by responding to that point of order. Opposition Members firmly believe that Members of Parliament are accountable to their constituents and to the public. How we vote and act in Committee should be seen, that is why we welcome having cameras in the Committee this morning. How Conservative Members vote, and the public response to their votes, are crucial parts of the democratic process that we shall reinforce in the time that is allotted to consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. It is, I believe, a long established practice of the House that when references are made to hon. Members, their constituencies are used as the means of identifying them. As at least three members of the Committee represent Kent constituencies, I wonder whether we could have a ruling on the matter. Would it not be courteous if we were correctly identified, rather than one of us having three heads?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. It is the convention to refer to another Member by his or her constituency, or in the case of a Minister, by his or her title. It is not in order to refer to another Member by name. There is a certain latitude, and sometimes in the heat of the moment hon. Members forget the name of the constituency and do the next best thing. I hope that in a smallish Committee like this, each of us will get to know the constituencies and refer to them. I suggest that in this period leading up to Christmas and the season of good will, it would be a great pity if personal references were made which, even if they were not matters of parliamentary privilege or breaking rules, fell short of high standards of courtesy towards one another. There is plenty to talk about and argue about without resorting to that, and I hope that we can start in that spirit and continue in the new year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones<span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Mon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I, too, welcome you, Dame Janet, as Chairman of our proceedings. I seem to have missed all the fun on the Water Bill in Committee because it appears that all the members of that Committee enjoyed working under your chairmanship. I welcome you, because you have already made a number of rulings this morning which convince me that you will deal with our deliberations with firmness and fairness.<br><br>
Before I come to the sittings motion, I wish to associate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
my self with the remarks of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) about the death of Laurie Pavitt. Last year, I had the privilege of piloting a private Member's Bill through the House; it was an amendment to the ten-minute Bill that Laurie Pavitt presented in 1968. It was a tremendous tribute to his hard work and dedication in piloting the Hearing Aid Council legislation through the House to set up the Hearing Aid Council. Last year, I introduced an amendment to that legislation, based on the tremendous work that he did in the late 1960s. He will be sadly missed, both in this House and by all those in the deaf community who have benefited from his work over the years.<br><br>
I come now to the sitting motion. Like the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), who was worried about Scotland, I am worried about the way in which Wales is to be dealt with. There is a difference between the ways in which Scotland and Wales are treated in the Bill; there are clauses which deal specifically with Scotland, but there are very few that deal specifically with Wales. It is important to consider the ways in which Wales is dealt with separately from England, and I can find only two or three references - in particular, paragraph 3 of schedule 1, which relates to the setting up of district health authorities in Wales, and paragraph 5 of the same schedule, which relates to the newly constituted family practitioner service authorities.<br><br>
It has been said this morning by Members on both sides of the Committee that we need to examine the way in which the Bill will change the Health Service and how it will affect the service in Wales, England and Scotland. I am concerned about the time that will be devoted to the provisions that deal with the distinctiveness of the various countries in Britain. I should have preferred separate Bills, not only on community care, which I wholeheartedly support, but on the provisions affecting the distinctiveness of Wales, Scotland and England, which should be given due care and scrutiny. In my view, separate Bills should have been introduced to deal with those issues.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and I are particularly worried. There is clearly no mandate for the proposals, either in Wales or Scotland, and in my view, the provisions in the Bill that deal with Wales and Scotland should have been referred to appropriate Committees. There are precedents—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I fear that the hon. Gentleman is going rather wide of the sittings motion, even though I am sure that he holds his views very strongly. May I ask him to address himself more narrowly to the motion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am obliged to you. Dame Janet, for that ruling, but the way in which the sittings motion has been debated leads me to believe that there will not be sufficient time for us to deal with these important matters.<br><br>
I should like to say a few words about the clauses that relate to community care, and echo the views expressed by Opposition Members about the way in which the provisions have been tagged on to the end of the Bill. I, like the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) — to give him his correct title and constituency — welcome the fact that the Bill contains clauses to deal with community care, but I should have preferred to see them in a separate Bill because in tagging them on to the end of the Bill there is a danger that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
contentious aspects of community care will not receive the full scrutiny that they deserve.<br><br>
These are my worries. I fear that the Committee' s detailed scrutiny of the Bill will be hampered, because before very long the Government will introduce a guillotine motion that will prevent us from discussing in detail the important issues that are involved in community care in England, Wales and Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I echo the comments from both sides of the Committee welcoming you, Dame Janet, as our Chairman over the new few months.<br><br>
It will appear strange to members of the public that we are having this debate on the sittings motion. They will wonder why there is such a fuss about a motion that gives the Committee ample time to debate the Bill. Opposition Members were complaining about the number of sittings, saying that in the good old days the Committee would have sat only in the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I suggest that they cannot have it both ways. Either they want plenty of time to debate the Bill, and we will have to sit here mornings and afternoons, which is perfectly reasonable, or they do not really want to discuss the Bill and merely wish to filibuster and prolong debate.<br><br>
I want the Bill on the statute book. I am quite happy to turn up on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30 am and sit until 1 o'clock, to come back in the afternoons at 4.30, and to sit as long as is needed to give full debate to the issues involved. It is nonsensical for Opposition Members to spend so long -now more than an hour, mainly of Opposition speeches -complaining that we do not have enough time and that we should not spend so much of each week debating the Bill.<br><br>
This is an important Bill, and we should be able to reach a civilised arrangement for debating its various clauses. I concur very much with the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) that it will be sensible to agree a timetable to ensure that the whole Bill is debated fairly and properly.<br><br>
There has been talk in the past from Members on both sides of the House - incidentally, I sit with the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) on the Select Committee on Procedure - about whether we should consider formal timetables on Bills so that we discuss them clause by clause. That would avoid the ridiculous practice —it has happened with other legislation — of, say, spending three months debating the first l0 clauses of a 140 clause Bill and rushing through the rest in four weeks flat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Does my hon. Friend agree that that is especially important as this Bill falls into two parts - the National Health Service reforms and the community care reforms —both of which are extremely important to everyone outside? It would be a tragedy if long speeches on the first part of the Bill deprived us of proper debate on the community care aspects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) makes an important point. I am especially anxious to debate the community care aspects as I am president of the local MENCAP in my constituency and know that my members want to make suggestions for improving the Bill.<br><br>
It should also be made clear that the Government have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
gone out of their way to help Opposition Members in the past few years. We have a system called notes on clauses which means that the Opposition regularly get details of the Department of Health's information on the clauses to be debated. When the Labour party was in Government that did not happen; the Opposition were denied the technical background to the clauses. But this Government decided that, for proper and informed debate, the Opposition should be given the same briefing notes on clauses as Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>:As the hon. Gentleman mentioned notes on clauses and, I understand, he believes in value for money, does he agree that the format of this set of documents is a waste of public money? If the Government are to provide notes on clauses, they should have done as they did for the Children Bill and produced photocopied notes instead of this expensive, glossy document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I trust that we are not going to have a debate on the format of the notes on clauses. I ask the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) to keep strictly to the terms of the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Thank you, Dame Janet, I merely point out to the hon. Gentleman that photocopying is more expensive than printing, so this is a more economical way of providing such information.<br><br>
I have two comments about Wales. I am one of five Welsh Members in this Committee. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) said that Wales is dealt with differently from England and Scotland. There are two important ways in which Wales is different from England and Scotland in relation to the Health Service, which is why there will be different clauses in the Bill.<br><br>
First, we do not have England's regional structure; our district health authorities deal directly with the Welsh Office, which I believe is a much better system than the regional system in England. Secondly, we have had a larger increase in real-terms spending on the Health Service; the figure is 45 percent. in Wales, compared with 42 per cent. in England. Therefore, it is important that Wales has a fair hearing and debate in this Committee and I am confident that that will happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Does my hon. Friend also acknowledge that Scotland has a separate legal system and that it is essential that clauses take that into account, as with any United Kingdom Bill that relates to Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. Before the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) continues, I remind him and other Committee Members once again of the terms of the motion before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Thank you, Dame Janet. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) anticipated my next point, and did so very well.<br><br>
It is, of course, helpful to the Opposition that we should debate Scotland under the same Bill. Three of the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen are Scottish Members. Presumably, if the Bill merely dealt with the Health Service in England and Wales, there would be complaints that three
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
Scottish Members had been bussed on to a Committee that did not deal with Scottish legislation, so it is rather handy that Scotland is included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I have had enough. Either the terms of the motion are strictly debated or hon. Members must resume their seats.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins<span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful for being called to speak, Dame Janet. After the previous contribution, I am aware that we are being steered by the sourtherly branch of the Celts. I am sure that that will inform our proceedings.<br><br>
There are sound, practical reasons why we should be concerned about the likely pace of the Bill's proceedings. First, there is a profound cash crisis - it is outside the terms of the debate — that especially affects big city teaching hospitals. The nature of that cash crisis throws considerable light on the Bill—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Gentleman must relate his remarks more closely to the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It is important, Dame Janet, that should be given the time and opportunity to examine the connection between what is in the Bill and what is going on in the outside world.<br><br>
One of the six pilot sites for the costing intiative, which we are told is part of the Bill's platform, is in my city of Newcastle. We do not have the results of that experiment yet and the timetable will not allow us an opportunity to consider them.<br><br>
11.45 am.<br><br>
Also outside the terms of the Bill, but relating closely to it, are several Government initiatives to convert many parts of the NHS into trading operations. In my region, the blood transfusion service is to be converted into a trading operation. We will not be given an opportunity to examine the connection between initiatives and the terms of the Bill.<br><br>
Finally, several important studies of staffing, recruitment and the availability of manpower were set in motion by the Government. I especially identify speech therapy. The reports on those services will not be available when we discuss the relevant sections of the Bill. That will create enormous anxiety.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will clarify the timetable outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). If the Government are committed to it, it will create enormous anxiety among hon. Members and among millions of people outside the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke<span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I join my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and my other hon. Friends in extending a welcome to you, Dame Janet, in taking the Chair of these important proceedings.<br><br>
On the first occasion that I was a member of a Standing Committee - it is the only previous occasion on which I have had the pleasure of sitting on a Committee under your chairmanship — John Golding made a speech that lasted for 11 ½ hours. I shall not threaten to repeat that this morning, and it is notable that none of my hon. Friends has sought to do so. However, this is essential and crucial legislation and we should be seen not to flinch from giving the time necessary to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
consider the details of the Bill and its impact upon those whom we seek to serve.<br><br>
I agree with those hon. Members who have expressed worries about Scotland. It is disgraceful that the sittings motion does not permit the discussion on Scottish issues that the Scottish people expect. Indeed, the motion does not allow for a separate Scottish Bill on the Health Service or on community care, both of which are essential. The Bill is very weak in that respect.<br><br>
Some of my hon. Friends, especially my hon Friends the Members for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) and for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) referred to the way in which the Children Bill was conducted. The hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), the Minister of State, Home Office, introduced an approach to our proceedings that might commend itself to Conservative Members when they consider the sittings motion. He gave the opportunity to Opposition Members, to those attending meetings at his Department and, most importantly, to voluntary organisations and professional bodies that were concerned with the impact of legislation, to give their views on the amendments and new clauses that the Committee was then discussing.<br><br>
Millions of people are interested in our deliberations. Some believe that the Government have been far from clear about what they intend to do about ringfencing the funds for community care. I do not speak only for the organisations that could be identified with my party. The National Care Homes Association has demanded clarity on this issue. Such organisations expect the timetable motion under discussion to allow them time to give us their views. We live in a parliamentary democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day<span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:Can the hon. Gentleman explain why Conservative Members who have come to discuss the National Health Service and Community Care Bill have had to sit here for 1 hour and 20 minutes without debating a single word or sentence? If Opposition Members are so anxious to get on to this matter, why is he the tenth hon. Member to waste the Committee's time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I suspect that by the time we make our decision on the sittings motion, we shall have created a speedy precedent for a major Bill. The contributions of my hon. Friends have been extremely constructive. We have a responsibility that we intend to discharge. As my hon. Friends have said, major issues surround the National Health Service and community care. It is important not to spend so much time on one issue that we might be tempted to ignore another.<br><br>
Nobody objected to the procedure on the Children Bill. Why should they? It involved democratic input. Organisations such as the Children Society are telling us that we are placing responsibilities on voluntary bodies that would make their positions untenable. They should know. They are worried about young people being discharged from care and becoming involved in crime, drugs and prostitution. They want, quite rightly in a democratic society, to give the House their views.<br><br>
If we rushed such matters, we should not be entitled to receive such advice and briefings. The views of voluntary bodies, carers and men and women who struggle day after day to make a reality of community care are important to the House; otherwise, democracy will have ceased to exist.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend mentioned the Children Bill. The Minister involved said that he would not proceed on certain important clauses until there was agreement between both sides of the Committee and the voluntary organisations that were advising the Committee. It would be highly appropriate if this Minister adopted the same procedure on crucial clauses in this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I entirely agree and I hope that the Minister will respond to that point today. If she feels it necessary to consult her right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, I am sure that the Committee will understand.<br><br>
We should listen not only to the views of members of this Committee — which are important — but to those of the voluntary and professional bodies. If the Bill is enacted they will have to work with a complex piece of legislation. That is not to say that Opposition Members always agree with the views that are expressed by such bodies. It may come as a surprise to the Committee to learn that I do not always agree with the British Medical Association — for example, when it covered my constituency with yellow posters which said, "What do you call a man who doesn't take his doctor's advice? Mr. Clarke." I should add that, although I received an apology, I doubt whether the Secretary of State ever will.<br><br>
We are at the start of an important period in the history of, and of interest in, the National Health Service and community care. It is important that we deal in details with those essential matters. The British people expect no less, and the Labour party has no intention, either in this Committee or elsewhere, of disappointing their aspirations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Health(Mrs. Virgina Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:May I begin, Dame Janet, by joining other hon. Members in warmly welcoming you as our Chairman? I am not sure whether I have shared as many experiences with you over the years as other members of the Committee have — most of our encounters have revolved around collaboration on the subject of Rotweilers — <i>[Interruption.]</i> Many other Members encounters sound more exciting. However, your authority, fairness and tolerance will be much appreciated by us all and we shall endeavour to behave in an orderly fashion under your chairmanship.<br><br>
I also endorse the remarks made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) about Laurie Pavitt, because he played a full part in, and was deeply committed to, the Health Service and we agree with the remarks that the hon. Gentleman made about his loss.<br><br>
As to the sittings motion, I welcome the commitment by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) not to filibuster or delay. I hope that he can exercise authority over some of his hon. Friends, because we have a great deal of work to do on this important Bill. Many of my right hon. and hon. Friends will welcome the service that he has agreed to perform to ensure that the achievements of the National Health Service, and our plans for its development and improvement, will be widely broadcast to all our local newspapers.<br><br>
Speaking on behalf of Conservative members of the Committee, I am not satisfied that we always get over our message as well as we should, and it is important that our local newspapers realise our achievements. I hope that the hon. Member for Livingston will ensure that his own house is in order that he will inform his local press that in his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
constituency, at St. John's hospital, he has one of the biggest National Health Service building projects ever established, certainly in Scotland.<br><br>
Similarly, I hope that the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) will ensure that her local paper knows about its £21 million hospital — and knows that in Halifax, over the past five years, there has been an increase of 25 per cent. In the number of day patients and of 10 per cent, in the number of inpatients treated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I fear that even Ministers are subject to the same rules of order as other hon. Members. Could we return to the sittings motion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Indeed; I take your rebuke, Miss Fookes. I will say only that the sittings motion makes it clear that we need time for rigorous and full debate. We have a great sense of pride and achievement in all that has been established in the National Health Service, but we believe that there is more work to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman<span class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Minister said that she believes that there needs to be ample time for debating this Bill in Committee. Will she then come clean and tell the Committee whether it is true that district health authorities have been told to expect Royal Assent in May? The Bill will not have Royal Assent in May if we are to have adequate time to discuss it both in Committee and on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:We have made it clear that the Government regard this as an important Bill which will build on and develop the National Health Service, of which we are proud and in which the Government have invested heavily. We wish to make headway to ensure that the health authorities can take any further steps to improve the service that they provide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Is it May?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:How much progress is made up to Parliament, and I shall not take the matter any further until Parliament has decided.<br><br>
With your forbearance, Dame Janet, I shall quickly address the points made by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). The sittings motion will allow time for my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, to deal with the Scottish clauses in the Bill. There will be ample opportunity to discuss and vote on them. Both White Papers cover the whole of Britain. Since its inception, only three Scottish Acts have been passed on the NHS: the remaining 13 Act have applied to the whole of Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:May I ask the Minister to be more forthcoming with my hon. Friend on the Front Bench, the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman). She was asked a direct question about whether the Bill had to secure its passage by a particular date. She was asked also whether the health authorities or any other organisation had been told that the Bill would be on the statute book by a particular date. We are entitled to know the answers to those questions. Perhaps departmental officials are telling district health authorities

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
about the timetable. The Minister has told my hon. Friend that she does not know about the timetable. Surely a Minister who states that she does not know the Government's position on the passage of a major Bill is a Minister who many Opposition Members might want to question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:We have made it clear that it is not possible to proceed with a number of measures until the Bill has completed its whole parliamentary passage. In discussion about NHS trusts it is clear that no formal applications can be accepted until the Bill has passed through Parliament. I repeat that it is up to Parliament to decide. We want the Committee to make good headway. To the best of my knowledge, moreover, district health authorities have not been given a specific date on which the Bill will have completed its passage through Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:May I make it clear to the Minister that words such as "to the best of my knowledge" are not good enough for this Committee. We need to know what instructions she has been given and what advice has been given to district health authorities. The Ministers weasel words will not satisfy the Committee. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman's remarks are typical of the time-wasting activity that many of us have become used to from Opposition Members. I have made the position absolutely clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:One thing is absolutely crystal-clear: that there are many people — either in the community care sector or within the NHS — who want certainty. The sooner that the Committee gets on with discussing the substance of the Bill rather than worrying about hypothetical dates of possible Royal Assent over which the Minister has no control, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:We make it clear yet again that we want to make headway on an important and valuable Bill to develop and build on the NHS and establish a framework for care in the community. Many hon. Members will know of my special commitment to that part of the Bill, and I hope that it will be possible to avoid time-wasting and make the progress that we all want to see. After the competition to speak in the sittings motion itself, it is clear that we need to make good headway. That has been vindicated. The public, patients and professionals within the Health Service all need to bring the uncertainty to an end. Our proposals put patients first and I hope that the Committe will support the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That at its rising this day the Committee do adjourn till Tuesday 9th January and that with effect from that day it do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I have one or two annoucements to make before we go further. First, there are financial resolutions attached to the Bill and copies should be available in the Room.<br><br>
I give the Committee notice that, as a normal rule, I do not

intend to call starred amendments.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely Clauses 1 and 2, Schedule 1, Clause 25, Schedule 5, Clauses 3 and 4, Clause 5, Schedule 2, Clauses 6 to 10, Schedule 3, Clauses 28 and 29, Schedule 6, Clauses 11, 33, 12to 16,30, 17,31, 18, 32and 19, Schedule 4Clauses20,34,21,35, 22,36,23,24,26,37,50,38,51,39to41.46,42,59,43,47,44,45,48 and 52 to 59, Schedule 7, new Clauses, new Schedules, Schedule 8, Clause 60. — <i>[Mrs. Virigina Bottomley.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am not selecting the amendments but, of course, it will be perfectly in order in any debate on the motion to bring in any points that might have been considered by the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael<span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:Having survived the Water Bill in Committee it is sad to be a member of another Committee that is dealing with a deservedly unpopular Bill, but I welcome the discipline which you, Dame Janet, introduced to its consideration. I have waited until now so that I might deal with the particular needs of Wales by objecting to the order of consideration.<br><br>
Ideally, I should like to exclude Wales from the Bill because it evades such considerations by its structure, and does not even consider the special needs of Wales. It fails to deal explicitly with the different way in which Wales treats matters relating to the National Health Service but it will do away with those different methods. We make it clear that we do not wish the Bill on to the people of England and Scotland, but the people of Wales have repeatedly demonstrated that the Government have no mandate to meddle with their Health Service.<br><br>
In the Vale of Glamorgan by-election, above all, and in the Pontypridd by-election, the European elections and every other way, the people of Wales have expressed their objections to the approach to the reform of the NHS since the Government published their White Paper. It has been made clear that Wales rejects the Bill.<br><br>
Attempts have been made in the media to give the impression that the Secretary of State for Wales will somehow soften the Bill's impact on Wales. The implication has been that the right hon. Gentleman has a soft manner, and admittedly, is more adroit and a better listener than the Secretary of State for Health. However, a difference of substance was promised by the Secretary of State for Wales. In the Welsh debate on 1 March he said that he recognised the special needs of Wales, but we see now that the Bill contains no differences of substance any more than did the consultation papers which were circulated by the Department of Health and somehow became the papers to be considered in Wales. The notes on clause 60 do not even mention the way in which it affects Wales by removing special arrangements in the principality.<br><br>
My case is not merely that the NHS has a special place in the hearts and minds of the people of Wales, although that is true. It is that there are differences in the Health Service in Wales and that the Bill will do away with those differences without debate. Those matters should be properly debated at the beginning of our proceedings, and they would be if clause 60 were to be dealt with at the appropriate stage.<br><br>
I shall cite an example of great importance. At present, community health councils exist in Wales to represent communities. Under the Bill's proposals, they will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
subsumed within one so-called community health council that will cover the whole area of a county. That is ludicrous. It represents the loss of a facility to the people of Wales. The only excuse that the Secretary of State for Wales has given is that a body covering a whole country will bring the opinions of different communities into one view. That approach seeks to still the voices of communities in Wales on Health Service matters and it is not acceptable.<br><br>
In my constituency, there are different needs in the Cardiff area and in the Vale of Glamorgan and we require two separate community health councils to reflect that. That is what we have now but the Bill will do away with the councils. It is ludicrous to look further afield and impose, a single community health council on the whole of Powys, which is 100 miles from one end to the other, on, the whole of Dyfed or on all the deprived valley communities of mid-Glamorgan. They have special health needs and require community representation, but the Bill would quietly do away with that facility in Wales. That issue should be debated at the beginning of our proceedings and not tucked away in some obscure corner of the Bill, for later discussion, as it is in clause 60.<br><br>
There are many issues that relate specifically to Wales and we should like the Bill to be delayed until after the next general election. I suspect that the opinion of people in England would then endorse the view of the people of Wales, which, has been expressed through elections in the past 12 months. In the Vale of Glamorgan by-election, we made the Health Service the main issue. That is why we had such a massive majority and the overturning of what had previously been regarded as a safe Conservative seat. The people of Wales have expressed their view in many ways, and it rejects the reforms proposed in the Bill and set out in the White Paper on the Health Service.<br><br>
Hospital opt outs are not wanted in Wales and no interest is expressed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. We are dealing with the order in which the Bill is to be considered. I do not believe that the people of Wales gave their verdict on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Quite so, Dame Janet, but they gave their verdict on their requirement that the Health Service in Wales should not be dealt with in the way proposed in the Bill. At present, certain measures give special consideration to Wales but the Bill would virtually ensure that the Health Service in Wales would be a pale reflection of what it is in England. I am suggesting that the order of consideration is back to front and that at its beginning should be a clause that would enable us to debate basic principles. That is why it is relevant to the order of consideration to say that hospital opt outs are not wanted in Wales. That has been made clear and there have been no expressions of interest in a contrary view.<br><br>
If the Government intend to press ahead with forcing change down the throats of the people of Wales, that is the only reason why Wales should be referred to or included in the relevant part of the Bill. The right of choice of doctor and consultant, and the obligation and right of GPs to prescribe on the basis of what is best for the patient, are matters on which the people of Wales have expressed their views. We should be able to declare points of principle on those matters at the beginning of our consideration of the clauses of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
There are special concerns about the negotiation of contracts with hospitals by health authorities. We must take account of distances in Wales, the needs of poor and rural communities and the special needs of communities which have been disadvantaged in health over many years. Our experience of those matters does not lead us to believe that much is promised, and the proposed approach has been rejected by the people of Wales.<br><br>
Community care has already been stressed and it forms an important part of the Bill. That subject would be dealt with differently in Wales as we could demonstrate if we could deal with clause 60 at the appropriate stage. Community care is especially important in Wales, and the vicious attack on the existing pattern of community health councils is worrying.<br><br>
The Griffiths report was given special consideration and debated in Wales by local authorities and voluntary organisations concerned with a range of health needs and with disabled and elderly people. There has been a panic transplant of consideration of community care into the Bill. After all those bodies had given such special consideration, there should be special treatment for Wales to reflect those discussions. However, they have been completely ignored along with the pattern of dealing with health matters in Wales until now.<br><br>
Local authorities in Wales have been attacked by the Government over the past 10 years but there is a special need to discuss resources in Wales. That was especially proved by yesterday's unsatisfactory statement on local government finance.<br><br>
The Secretary of State of Wales seems to have run away from the reform of the Health Service. Given his idea of what is popular and what is unpopular, that should worry Conservative Members. His lack of consideration for Wales has undermined the office of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office. That will not be open to proper debate under this order of consideration. We want a Health Service in Wales that is sensitive to the needs of the people in Wales and gives them a voice in its operation without a change in the order of consideration. But the Bill makes the Health Service in Wales a pale reflection of the Health Service in England and subjects it to equally disastrous treatment. The Welsh Office and the position of the Secretary of State for Wales will be undermined and the communities and individuals in its operation will have no voice. The few remaining Conservatives, including the Mnister will pay dearly for the contempt of the people of Wales, but it is sad that we have no opportunity to debate the principles and seek an amendment at the beginning of the Bill's consideration.</span></p>
<p>12.15pm.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells<span class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I rise briefly to criticise the order of consideration of the Bill. It is proper to draw the Committee's memory back to the origins of the NHS and to the person most responsible for setting it up — Aneurin Bevan. The proposals grew out of his revulsion at the sight of nurses collecting money for their hospitals on flag days instead of doing the work they should have been doing. Despite the earlier tribute by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) to the Government's funding record over the past decade, my constituents are worried that we shall see a return to those days. The Bill will facilitiate that, because the Health Service will be able to opt out from its responsibilities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
I do not blame the people of Wales if they do not see the relevance of the Bill to their situation. I declare a special interest because my 22-month-old son is in a hospital ward in my constituency. His ward is ramshackle and massively underfunded. I would like the hon. Member for Pembroke to visit it and to see whether it is fit for the children of Wales in the late 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I fear that the hon. Gentleman is falling into the same trap as others on a previous motion. We must ensure that arguments relate to the order in which the Bill is to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I apologise for drifting, Dame Janet. I want to speak about the order of clauses.<br><br>
It is clear from the arguments advanced by my hon. Friends that the order of consideration is grossly unsatisfactory. An attempt is being made to steamroller the Bill on the people of Wales, and they will not stand for it. Welsh Opposition Members intend to make that clear, and I hope that the Committee will take note.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I do not want to detain the Committee long, but if we are to hear a Welsh perspective from the Opposition, we should also hear the voice of reason from Wales from Conservative Members. It is interesting that Opposition Members are calling for Wales to be put into some sort of ghetto away from the mainstream of debate of the United Kingdom Parliament. I was sent here by my constituents to debate Welsh interests and issues, including the Health Service in a United Kingdom Parliament. I welcome the fact that Wales is part of the mainstream Health Service debate in this Committee and that will not be pushed to one side. The fears of my constituents are the same as those of constituents throughout Wales, Scotland and England. They want a good Health Service. That is what the Bill is about, and the debate should take place in this Commitee. Wales should be debated in the United Kingdom Parliament and not pushed to the margins.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:May I add my welcome to those that you have already received for chairing the Committee, Dame Janet? It is about five years since I served on a Committee that you chaired —I believe that it was the 1984 Finance Bill. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) should note that the Government Whip on that Bill has since held three Cabinet offices including, within the past six month, that of Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br><br>
I represent the Scottish Labour Front Bench spokesman on health, my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who would be here were he not ill. We all wish him a speedy recovery.<br><br>
I was surprised when the Minister moved the motion, as she gave no explanation for one of the strangest order of consideration of clauses that I have ever seen. We normally proceed almost sequentially, with the relevant schedules being considered at the appropriate stages. But that has not happened here. The order of consideration states that we take clauses 1 and 2, schedule 1 and then jump to clause 25 and schedule 5. Then we go back to clauses 3 and 4 and go forward to clause 27 and back to clause 5 and schedule 2, and so on, throughout the Bill. That is strange.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) said that there were two Bills within this one document. That is wrong: there are at least four Bills in this document. There is an English health Bill, an English and Welsh health Bill, a Scottish health Bill, an English and Welsh Community Care Bill and a Scottish community care Bill. As the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) said in an earlier debate, in any democratic society we would be debating the Scottish Health Service in a democratically elected Scottish Assembly. Our minimum requirement is a Scottish health Bill, which should be separate from this Bill and should be debated by Scottish Members of Parliament in a Scottish Committee. If we cannot have that, we should at least have an order of consideration of clauses that allows us to debate the Scottish elements of the Bill separately from the rest of the Bill. My hon. Friends who represent constituencies in England and Wales would be happy to join in that debate. There are three Opposition Scottish Front Benchers, as well as the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, so 25 per cent. of Opposition Members represent Scottish constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland</span><span class='membercontribution'>(Mr. Michael Forsyth): If Scottish Labour Members are so anxious to debate the Scottish aspects of the Bill, why did not one Scottish Labour Back Bencher speak on Second Reading? Why are no amendments tabled to the Scottish provisions in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Some Scottish Members tried to take part in the first day of debate on Second Reading and were told by Mr. Speaker that they had no chance of doing so, and no chance of speaking during the second day of the debate. Secondly, the tabling of amendments is directly related to the motion, which is the consideration of clauses. My hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies, including my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, assumed that the Bill would be debated in the normal sequential manner and that the Scottish clauses would be debated towards the end of January, so giving plenty of time to table amendments to the clauses affecting Scotland. Anyone in his normal mind would think that, but that is not what will happen. I assure the Minister that Scottish amendments will be tabled.<br><br>
The Bill has been organised in this way because if there were separate debates on Scotland and we had to take parts II and IV as continuous sections, the Under-Secretary and his one Scottish Back-Bench colleague, the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) would have considerable difficulties. I assumed that the Minister would be here, but that the hon. Member for Tayside, North - the original nodding dog of Scottish politics - would not be here all the time. The order of the clauses shows the weakness of the Tory party in Scotland. The Tories are incapable of manning a Scottish health Bill Committee. As another Scottish Committee will be sitting in January, both the Scottish Conservative Members on this Committee will have to serve on that one as well because it is impossible to man a Scottish Committee without them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I do not take as narrow a view of United Kingdom politics as many Opposition Members appear to do. It may assist the hon. Gentleman to know that the existing

system of social work organisation in Scotland was partly set up by myself — admittedly, at a junior level — when I was a member of the Civil Service team supporting the Ministers who introduced the system. I have taken a considerable interest, and shall continue to do so, in the organisation of the National Health Service and social work in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:As my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said, the hon. Gentleman set up that structure under a Labour Government.<br><br>
The two Conservative Scottish members of this Committee will have to serve also in Committee on the Enterprise and New Towns (Scotland) Bill. The Minister and his hon. Friend will be able to go down the Corridor and vote in the other Committee because of the order in which the clauses in this Bill will be debated. If we were debating the provisions relating to Scotland separately, the hon. Gentlemen would be in great difficulties. That emphasises the point that Scottish Tories are almost a forgotten breed. There will be far fewer of them after the next general election, when the Minister hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), for one, will lose his seat, as part of the process of bringing in a Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales</span><span class='membercontribution'>(Mr. Ian Grist):The Scottish intervention underlined what I wanted to say, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), to the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). The hon. Gentleman's complaint is trivial. His reason for making it either shows ingenuity — in which event he does not need to worry about the order in which the clauses are debated — or shows that he does not want to be here when we do debate the clauses. There will be plenty of opportunity to debate them in the course of our proceedings.<br><br>
We shall not be able to debate all the issues raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth because many of them, such as community health councils and doctors' contracts, do not appear in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The slaughter of the community health councils is not trivial. I shall be here right through the Committee's proceedings, and I hope that the Minister will be as well. The fact that he says that certain issues do not appear in the Bill makes my point for me. The removal of certain Welsh issues is also not a trivial matter. The Minister should consider the important needs of Wales instead of trying to gloss over the way in which Wales will be damaged by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Dame Janet, you would not know about it, but members of the Welsh Grand Committee recently had a full day's debate on the Health Service. It was the second such debate in 12 months, and we have had many other opportunities to debate the matter. Therefore, the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has not lacked a platform on which to put forward his views, which he has done with his usual pertinacity.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether a Welsh Assembly might be established one day.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. The debate is going too wide of the order of consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I have a feeling that the subject of an Assembly will occasionally creep into our debates -probably well—smuggled.<br><br>
The Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth and for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) are mistaken if they believe that health authorities, health workers, others who work in the Health Service and patients in Wales do not look forward to the improved relations in the service that our proposals will bring. More choice and greater professional opportunities will be welcomed by them and will be more understood as our debates proceed. Just as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth managed to refer to measures that are not in the Bill, so stories have been put around that the Bill contains provisions that are not for the good of the public. The more that our carefully calculated debates - with no filibustering — are exposed to the public, the more the truth will come out. That is why the order of consideration of the Bill, as proposed, is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The occupants of the Government Front Bench have not yet explained why such an order of consideration has been proposed. Some of my hon. Friends have asked serious questions about it, but I am willing to be persuaded that the order that is under discussion is the proper way in which to consider the Bill. No Minister has presented a case to the Committee in support of the motion on which we are being invited to vote. It would be preposterous if the Committee were forced to make a decison without a Minister explaining why the Government proposed the motion without attempting to consult the Opposition about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is not a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I wish to make a brief contribution in much the same spirit as the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). Scottish hon. Members may be experiencing a taste of things to come. We have heard from the health Minister with responsibility for England and the health Minister with responsibility for Wales but, uncharacteristically, we have not heard a cheep this morning from the Under-Secretary of State of Scotland with responsibility for health.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It is highly likely that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will complain to the BBC if he is not shown in our televised proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is a fair point. Given the quagmire in which the Minister is now in on that matter, an exchange of letters might be an appropriate way to resolve the problem. English members of the Committee will not understand that joke - as will happen when many other aspects are debated.<br><br>
In response to my earlier inquiry, the Minister for Health said that we would be able to have specific Scottish debates with which her hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would deal and on which we could vote. However, that glossy phraseology does not answer my question. Will we have separate Scottish debates with separate Scottish votes? That question has not received a fair and square response, and it would be for the convenience of the Committee if the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland stood on his pins and considered it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am always to assist the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). Moreover, if it will help the Committee to make progress, I shall explain the thinking behind the motion. It was considered to be for the Committee's convenience if the provisions of the Bill covering Scotland were discussed at the same time as self-governing hospitals and NHS trusts, for example. The Committee could then consider the implication of the provisions for the United Kingdom as a whole and specific Scottish aspects of them. It is for hon. Members to decide whether they wish to debate at length specific Scottish aspects, and I have no doubt that they will be forthcoming in so doing. It is for the Opposition to table amendments to try to alter certain provisions as they relate to Scotland, and there will be an opportunity for them to be debated.<br><br>
The motion seeks to ensure that the schedules that relate to particular clauses are discussed at the same time. That will be convenient for the Committee and it is common practice. It will ensure, too, that aspects that relate to Scotland are debated and considered at the same time. Otherwise, hon. Members would find themselves repeating many of the principles that relate to the Health Service as a whole. We have a United Kingdom Health Service — there is no such thing as a Scottish Health Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Why do we have a separate Minister, then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Because we have separate means for administering the Health Service. There are differences, but it operates on a United Kingdom basis. Patients travel north and south of the border. For example, Scottish patients who need heart transplant operations come south for them. We must consider these important improvements in a United Kingdom context, and members of the Committee must have the opportunity to examine the Scottish provisions. I am happy to give the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart the assurance that he seeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I find that reply astonishing and slightly worrying. The Minister at the Scottish Office with responsibility for health says that there is a United Kingdom Health Service, not a separate Scottish one. But the service in Scotland is organised separately and financed differently from the rest of the Health Service. If the Minister believes that there is a United Kingdom Health Service, perhaps we could dispense with his services and he could spend all his time as chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland. Of course, his salary could not then be paid out of public funds.<br><br>
The Minister said that we would discuss English and Scottish matters together. If amendments are tabled to the Scottish clauses which are similar to those tabled to the English clauses, I hope that you will keep them separate, Dame Janet, and not include them in the same groupings; otherwise, there would be no separate Scottish debates on particular pinciples. I hope that you will give us an assurance that there will be separate Scottish debates on each of the principles laid down in the clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Committee will appreciate that I have no responsibility for the order that is proposed, or any other order. I am unable to give a ruling in advance about groupings of amendments, as I must examine them first. I remind the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr.

Maxton) that when amendments are grouped and discussed together, there can always be a separate vote on each, if desired. That is entirely a matter for members of the Committee. I cannot go beyond that general point of principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I accept your ruling, Dame Janet. The way in which the Bill has been organised has created anger in Scotland. The Scottish people are completely opposed to it, and the Goverment have no mandate in Scotland, where they have been roundly defeated in successive general elections. If we do not have separate debates on many of the Scottish issues, there will be considerable anger in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has raised certain matters that are vital to the Scottish issue. The hon. Gentleman is right that there is great Scottish interest in the Bill. I am astonished that the Labour party has failed to appoint any Scottish Labour Back Benchers to the Committee, bearing in mind that they form a large part of the Opposition. If the Labour party were serious about the matter, I should have thought that it would have appointed Scottish Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. That is not a matter that we should deal with now. I understand that appointments to the Committee are made by the Committee of Selection, which has its own methods and criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Dame Janet, I fully understand that you are bound by the rules and that it is your function to interpret those rules. But may I invite you to expand on your reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)? Otherwise, we are in some difficulty about the motion before us, and on which we are to divide. You said that if amendments relate to similar subjects — in the way that my hon. Friend mentioned — it is possible that they can be grouped together, but that we could have separate divisions.<br><br>
However, I do not think that that was what my hon. Friend was seeking. He was looking for separate and distinct debates on Scottish matters. If, for example, his amendment is tagged on to the end of an amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) and myself, she and I will open and close on that debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart would obviously wish for a specific debate that would allow him to expand on Scottish matters.<br><br>
Given the anxiety that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) has shown about the BBC, he must wish for an opportunity to intervene and would not wish BBC Scotland to be carrying only the speeches of his right hon. Friend and Colleague the Secretary of State for Health and hon. Friend the Minister for Health.<br><br>
There is a motion before the Committee. Were we to treat the Bill as we would normally, we would take the clauses sequentially. I accept the Under-Secretary's point about taking the schedules with the relevant clauses, as that makes sense and is not in contention. The bulk of the matter in clause 1 is in schedule 1 and it is therefore appropriate to take schedule 1 at that time. As the motion is worded, we are then asked to turn to clause 25, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart would be obliged to table his amendments to clause 25 before the House rises for the recess. You, Dame

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
Janet, would then be obliged to consider whether the amendments should be linked to the amendments to clauses 1 and 2.<br><br>
Were we to come to clause 25 at its place in the Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart would not be obliged to table his amendment now, and you, Dame Janet, would not be obliged to reach a judgment on whether to link it with my amendment. Thus the point that you have made on procedure is highly germane to whether or not we oppose the motion. Before we come to divide, I plead with you to recognise —1 understand that you cannot compromise the order— that we require distinct Scottish debates, as well as Scottish votes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. I have to act within a firm framework and will have to be guided by what the order of clauses is to be. To that extent, the matter does not rest with me, but is a Committee decision and one that we are debating now. I can deal with it only as it comes to me and that is why previously I could give the Committee simply general points of principle. I cannot go further now. I hope that the Committee will understand that so far as it is within my power, within the framework, I shall try to ensure that everyone who wishes to speak will be able to do so. Beyond those general words, I cannot give the kind of assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks.<br><br>
The Committee must make up its mind about the order and, if necessary, vote upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I thank you, Dame Janet, for the candour of your response. In the light of your assurance that you are bound by the rules, I must advise my hon. Friends to vote against the motion, as otherwise we are in danger of losing the distinctive Scottish debate that we are seeking.</span></p>

new Clauses, new Schedules, Schedule 8, Clause 60.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>12.45 pm.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. I stress that I am not wasting the Committee's time. Some weeks ago, a Secretary of State was unreasonably attacked in the media because of his private financial affairs. That happened because of rules, which are approved by the Prime Minister and which govern Ministers' private affairs. They require that a Minister must arrange his financial affairs so that they do not conflict with his public duties. Ministers are required to divest themselves of their pecuniary interests, especially shareholding interests, when they are appointed. I accuse no one of impropriety. But when we examined the matter in detail, we found that Ministers — and that applies to all Ministers — must ask a stockbroker or financial intermediary to handle their affairs at arm's length. They are not notified of the transactions that take place in their names. The Secretary of State concerned, who was unfortunately the subject of a television programme was unaware that substantial capital gains had been made in his name through the purchase and selling of shares. He is not responsible for the day-to-day management of his accounts by his stockbroker or financial intermediary. That raises an issue of principle: a Minister who is dealing with a Bill before the House, but who has not interfered on a day-to-day basis with the management of his or her account, may well be a beneficiary through the transaction of shares with or without his or her knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but this is a very lengthy point or order. Could he come to the point that affects my ruling as Chairman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>:He just wants to make a speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:No, it is an important principle. The hon. Gentleman is very silly if he cannot see that.<br><br>
A Minister on this Committee may have shares transacted in his or her name, without his or her knowledge, in Health Service-related companies, and may make substantial gains. I do not accuse any Minister of anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>:So why are you talking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Because there is an issue of principle.<br><br>
A Minister may have an arrangement with a stockbroker or financial intermediary to handle their affairs. There was, and still is, a Minister in this Government, who had, before his appointment, a direct interest in a company that was pressing for privatisation of Health Service contracts in three areas: catering, domestic services and laundry. I know that because a representative of one of the organisations that that Minister's company was covering, telephoned me to complain about the substantial commission of £80,000 in one year that was paid to that company.<br><br>
That Minister, if he were sitting on a Health Service Bill today, could have arranged his financial affairs so that the interest in such a company was retained and capital gains could accrue to his account, even though he was not handling his account on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>
Whilst the Minister may not be handling that day-to-day
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
account, he may be making gains and be a member of this Committee. That is possible. If that is possible, it is for you, Dame Janet, before proceedings on this Bill — [Hon. Members: "Smears."] My point of order is that it is for you, Dame Janet, to establish whether the ministerial rules, as applied by the Prime Minister, apply to the proceedings of this Committee. If a Minister has an interest over which he has no direct control, but through which he may make substantial gains because of the Bill, the Committee should be made aware of it before proceedings start. This is not a spurious intervention, but an important matter that has implications for many future Bills.<br><br>
Ministers try to ensure that their private interests do not conflict with their public duties, but their efforts may not be sufficient to satisfy public anxieties, if, after the Bill is enacted, it were discovered that Ministers had had indirect interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies (Stanford and Spalding)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I want to make one point before anybody else raises points of order. I do not intend to rule on the importance of such matters, great as it may be, because they are not matters for the Chairman of a Standing Committee. The Chairman of a Standing Committee requires that hon. Members declare a direct interest where one exists, but the initiative for that declaration must come from the individual Member. The Committee will recall that, after the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) had declared some interest, I said that I would call upon any hon. Member who felt that he or she had a direct interest to declare it before we started on the substance of the Bill. I cannot go beyond that. The matters that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) seeks to raise are not for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Since the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) was clearly referring to me, it might help the Committee to make progress if I assured him that my entry in Register of Members' Interests is correct. I sold all interest in my company well before the last general election. I have no further interest in it, and it is disreputable of the hon. Gentleman to imply anything to the contrary. Had he given me notice, I could have clarified my position and the Committee need not have been detained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Withdraw!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It would be appropriate for any other hon. Member who wishes to declare an interest to do so now, before I take any other point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I spoke with you before the Committee began its sittings, Dame Janet. You suggested that you would prefer to take declarations of interest between the sittings motion and the procedural motions which are the substantive part of the debate on the Bill. I wish to declare my interest. I have recently advised and received briefing from Messrs. Pfizer Ltd. of Sandwich in Kent. I also advise a firm called Denplan Ltd., which is involved in continuing care insurance for dentistry. The latter interest will not impinge on the Bill in any way, although the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
former, pharmaceutical, interest clearly will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:May I declare my sponsorship by the National Union of Public Employess? I do not receive a penny from that sponsorship, and all my interests are declared in the Register of Members Interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It is so peripheral that I think that it is almost unnecessary for me to mention it, but the Register of Members' Interests lists my connection with a company called JBP Associates as well as a very tenuous connection with the British Franchise Association. There is a remote possiblity of a conflict of interest in both cases, as franchising is a useful way of introducing care into the community and the company has occasionally represented the Royal College of Midwives. The connections are extremely tenuous, but I believe it appropriate to declare them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon<span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I want to delcare an interest. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) I receive a sponsorship from NUPE.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. If hon. Members of either side murmur and mutter it is very difficult to hear the hon. Member who is speaking. It is a cardinal principle of any Committee that I Chair that each hon. Member who has the Floor is entitled to a full and fair hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. Hon. Members have not understood the point that I was making. My contention is that hon. Members may have appointed stockbrokers or financial intermediaries to act on their behalf. Those appointees may have no links with any previous shareholdings held before an hon. Member becomes a Minister. The appointments may be made simply for the purpose of investing existing funds. But the difficulty arises when that financial intermediary seeks to invest in a health-related business. In that case the Minister, even though he or she may be unaware of the investment, may be the unwitting recipient of a financial gain in a health-related service industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make, but I have already given my ruling on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am not sure whether I have an interest that should be declared as I believe it to be so peripheral that it is probably not germaine to the Committee's deliberations. I am a consultant to Vickers Plc, a very large British company that owns a number of firms, including Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. It also owns a small Danish subsidiary which manufacturers medical equipment such as heart defibrillators.</span></p>
