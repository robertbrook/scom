	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 535, in page 18, line 8, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will recall, Dame Janet, that I attempted to speak about this issue on clause 9. I was told that I would have a better opportunity to do so on clause 18. I am happy to embrace that opportunity because such a debate on clause 9 would have dealt with the introduction of capital charges solely in relation to NHS trusts. But capital charges will have a dramatic effect across the Health Service, especially in directly managed hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Health said that subsection (4) was highly technical, he was correct. Fortunately, the Under-Secretary is here to respond. Although the matter is technical, and the calculations are complicated, the effect of capital charges will be brutally simple and dramatic. What will happen, and what is in progress, is that every hospital site and building will be valued and a quasi-rent will have to be paid for the first time since 1948. It is worth recalling that three quarters of our hospital buildings were in existence and had been paid for in 1948 by local communities which will now find themselves caught in an annual payments system for the use of buildings and sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a comprehensive and wide-ranging register of assets which, in addition to buildings and land, will cover every piece of equipment worth more that £1,000. That could be the largest inventory in European history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>:Except the Domesday Book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I suspect that a register of every building, site and piece of equipment owned by the NHS will be larger than the Domesday Book. Furthermore, the Domesday Book was a one-off exercise; the register will be recompiled every three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) pointed out in his entertaining speech last week, there is much vamping on the Government Benches about the effect of the clause. But no one really knows what they will be, and no one knows how much the capital charges will be in this clause. We can obtain a glimpse of how much they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>684</span>
might be looking at the 1987 valuation roll of the health authorities. The Under-Secretary has written in his helpful letter to us all that the valuation will use a different basis from that of 1987. It was not always thus: working paper 9 describes the 1987 valuation as a base from which health authorities can start to compile their liability to capital charges. In the absence of fresh figures, the 1987 valuation is all that we can use to glimpse what is about to happen. If the Under-Secretary has more up-to-date figures from the current register of assets I should be happy if he would lodge them with the Library, and I assure him that they will receive publicity equal to that which the Opposition gave to the 1987 figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1987 figures give the existing use value of all premises in NHS ownership. I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell the Committee what interest rate the Government intend to apply to capital valuation. A figure of 6 per cent. has been bandied around, and I should welcome a confirmation of that figure from the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot know how much is likely to be charged unless we have an idea of the interest figure. It will be applied to the existing use value, which covers only building and sites, and to property and equipment. If we take 8 per cent. as an appropriate figure to apply over the existing use value, and add one third of the value to allow for equipment, we can get a broad idea of the magnitude of the capital charges. On that basis, I examined the details of the DHAs in the constituencies of Conservative Members. The DHA that serves the constituencies of the Secretary of State and of the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) would have the largest capital charge—it would be liable to an annual charge of £24 million. It is a very large DHA, and the Secretary of State is entitled to object that £24 million, which represents 17 per cent. of the annual revenue, is not too large a figure. The DHAs in the constituencies of other Conservative Members, however, showed higher percentages. The highest was in Bromley DHA, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), which would face a capital charge of 29 per cent. of its annual revenue. The DHA in the constituencies of the hon. Members for mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) would have capital charges of 27 per cent. The Somerset DHA, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson), would face an annual charge of 25 per cent. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) is not present, as I do not like him to miss an opportunity to intervene, but the DHA in his constituency would face a capital charge of 23 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt Conservative Members will say that such figures are academic as health authorities will be compensated for the capital charges. But that does not alter the fact that there are such differing figures. If the DHA in the constituency of the hon. Member for Chislehurst were to receive full compensation of 29 per cent.—though I am not confident that it would— capital charges would still make up 22.5 per cent. of its total budget. That would place it at a competitive disadvantage with the private sector and with other DHAs, such as that in Gillingham, in which capital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>685</span>
charges would be only 8 per cent. of its total annual expenditure. There will be increased pressure on DHAs to dispose of the assets that have incurred such a large capital charge. Money may be recycled, but there will be a perceptible impact on the way in which management choose to provide health services in their district. That must be so, otherwise the elaborate arrangements proposed in the subsection would be pointless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to tell the hon. Member for Harlow, who has just come in, that he has missed an opportunity to intervene. If he sticks around he will doubtless be stimulated to intervene later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The large capital charges forced by health authorities must be put in the context of an equally dramatic change in the way in which the annual revenue of health authorities will be calculated. The capital charges are arriving not in a vacuum but at a time when allocations for health authorities are to be shifted from a basis of historic expenditure to capitation. That means that inner city health authorities are likely to lose heavily in their revenue allocations at the same time as they face large payments back to RHAs as a result of capital charges because they are sitting on expensive sites in city areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:May I give my hon. Friend an example? My district hospital will be a beneficiary under the new system. Its property and assets will be valued at substantially less than properties in the inner cities. It may benefit substantially from capitation charges as opposed to the present RAWP formula. If we gain, another area will lose. I can assume only that it will be the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend helpfully takes me on to the illustration that I was about to share with the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the case of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central. Under the new capitation allocation, Newcastle DHA is likely to lose about £68 million, which is over half its total revenue allocation. At the same time that health authority, on the basis of 8 per cent. of existing use value, will face an annual fresh expenditure of £12 million on capital charges. That will put Newcastle DHA in a curious position. It will receive an increase in revenue of £12 million to meet the new capital charges, but will lose £68 million in revenue allocation. That will plainly make the capital charges onerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>indicated assent.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) nods in agreement. The position in south Manchester is equally grim. On the new capitation basis his DHA is likely to lose £46 million, just over half its budget, and will face capital charges of £11 million. The DHA of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) will lose
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>686</span>
about £16 million in revenue allocation, but will face a new expenditure on capital charges of £5.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those changes will so dramatically affect the finances of health authorities that not even this Government propose that they come in immediately the Bill is enacted. There has been much talk in the White Paper, the working papers and in speeches about transitional periods to soften the blow of the dramatic changes in swings and roundabouts. That leaves us asking how long the transition period will be. I press the Under-Secretary of State for Health for guidance on that. There is some tension between what is said to the press and what is said in the official documents. The press release of June 1989, which accompanied working paper 9 on capital charges stated:
	<br><q><p>"The value of land and buildings will always vary, being highest in inner urban areas. Long-term arrangements will be needed to ensure that districts have appropriate funding to meet the costs of buying from hospitals they have been accustomed to dealing with".</p></q>
The only arrangements included in the working paper that accompanied the press release come under a section that is headed not "Long-term arrangements", but "Short-term funding". We are entitled to ask the Minister whether the transition period will be long or short. Whatever it is, the Committee would be wise to ask, before we embark on it whether we wish to arrive at the final stage. I have three worries about the charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is possible in theory, under existing legislation, to bring in a system of capital charging. There are also mechanisms in the clause that ensure that high capital assets can be taken into account. Since the hon. Gentleman is anxious to ensure the good running of the NHS, what are his proposals for ensuring that managers are aware of the capital costs of their assets, and of the need to run those assets efficiently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am glad that the hon. Member asked that question. One of the witnesses that I shall cite in my case for the prosecution is the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. It has produced a helpful statement—the most comprehensive yet— on the proposed system of capital charges. I need not remind the hon. Gentleman that the association is not affiliated to the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Its statement reads:
	<br><q><p>"we are certain that NHS managers are quite aware of the cost of wear and tear from their own everyday experiences and do not need an elaborate accounting system to tell them this. Their main problem—"</p></q>
that problem being NHS managers managing their capital—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"is that the constraints of the NHS financing mechanism mean that they are unable to apply sufficient funds to fixed asset replenishment as they would wish."</p></q>
Chartered accountants auditing the Health Service give no evidence to show that NHS managers are unaware of the value of the capital and assets that they employ. That is not the problem that the proposal seeks to solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>687</span>
I shall return to the three matters in the proposal that worry me. If the hon. Member listens to them he will see through the proposal of his hon. Friends on the Front Bench. He will also understand why the proposed elaborate recycling has nothing to do with making NHS managers appreciate the value of their property and everything to do with the new marketing mechanism that the Government seek to create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his note to us, the Under-Secretary gave three reasons for viewing the proposals as a benefit. The third reason, which was developed at greater length, was that the proposal would
	<br><q><p>"enable the costs of NHS service provision to be evaluated on a more comparable basis with other providers of health care, whose prices have always had to reflect capital costs."</p></q>
I invite my hon. Friends to mark those words well. One of the three reasons for justifying capital charges, and therefore for imposing them on the Health Service, is that they will put NHS service provision on the same footing as "other providers", which I understand to mean private sector providers. So the intention, as I understand it, is to create a level competition between the NHS and the private sector in which the NHS also has to pay for its capital. I wonder whether that competition will be a level one. Many of the other providers—the private sector hospitals—account for their capital and assets at historic cost. The clause proposes something different. The difference is made explicit in the opening page of working paper 9, where, under the reference of capital charges, it says:
	<br><q><p>"capital charges are made up of two parts, a depreciation calculated on ordinary commercial accounting principles—"</p></q>
I emphasise the words, "ordinary commercial accounting principles", which are the principle normally used by the other providers—
	<br><q><p>"but based on the current value of the capital asset.</p></q>
The "but" should be carefully noted. A distinction is being signalled clearly in the working paper. It is that whereas other providers may account for their assets and their capital at historic costs, NHS hospitals must account for them at current cost valued upwards every three years. That is bound to create a cost disadvantage. I told the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle that I would refer to the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. It said:
	<br><q><p>"If DMSs are forced to charge depreciation at current cost … they will have a much higher cost structure than competing independent hospitals who do not have to charge depreciation in this way. This could place DMSs in a very difficult position when trying to win contracts."</p></q>
The unfair competition will not be only with the private sector hospitals. I want to tease out from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary the position of the directly managed services in relation to the NHS trusts. The capital charges for NHS trusts will be on a different basis, that of public dividend capital, for which a separate rate may be assessed, compared with the interest rate for the capital charges on NHS hospitals. They will be based, too, on a loan at the moment when the NHS trust is formed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the historic loan made at the time the trust is created also be revalued every three years? If not, with the passage of time that NHS trust will be left with a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>688</span>
significant commercial and financial advantage over those directly managed hospitals whose charges will be ratcheted up every three years. If that is the case, the device is designed to ensure not level but unfair competition, in which the directly managed hospitals are at a disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry to press my hon. Friend, but an early response—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend should remember that the Minister is on the Government side of the Committee. I shall be happy to press him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Perhaps the Minister will rise to respond to my hon. Friend's argument. Section 4.4 of working paper 1 mentions the need for consistency between directly managed and NHS trust capital servicing charging arrangements. Pressing the Minister on the subject now might help to curtail the debate and give us time to discuss the matter. Will the Minister intervene to clarify the point that my hon. Friend raised, otherwise I shall speak on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not sure whether my hon. Friend's last remark was a rebuke to me or an invitation to the Minister. I shall be happy to give way if the Minister wishes to intervene. I am glad that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary is replying to the debate. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that I strongly believe that the Minister will answer our questions. He always does, although we may not like the answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister intervenes, I shall return to my second cause for concern. It relates to the other justifications in the press release from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary. It says that capital charges will increase managers' awareness of the cost of capital and will provide an incentive to them to use their assets more efficiently. It is important that we crack the code of the statements. The incentive to managers to use their assets more efficiently is a sharp incentive, as my hon. Friend said, to flog off these assets to ensure that they have fewer of them. They would receive a capital receipt from the sale, and reduce capital charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Managers thus have a double incentive to sell property. A steady stream of hospitals has been sold already; under the new system that is likely to swell to a flood. I quote in evidence the words of one of the Secretary of State's officials, Mr. Ceri Davies, who is assistant director of works at the Department of Health. I do not know whether he is present, but as the quotation was expected, I suspect that he is visiting Newcastle, Carlisle, Falmouth—anywhere, as long as it is far away from Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In February, shortly after publication of the White Paper, Mr. Ceri Davies was quoted in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i>as saying:
	<br><q><p>"The point that everyone has missed over the past five years is that they"—</p></q>
that is, health authorities—
	<br><q><p>"are sitting on extremely valuable pieces of surplus assets which they can make a bomb out of."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:What's wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>689</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman is corroborating my worry.
	<br><q><p>"What the review is all about is maximising existing assets; bringing in capital charges will do more than anything else to achieve that. Only when you charge rent will people take their space serious."</p></q>
That clearly implies that the function of capital charges is to foster managers' perception that, in the words of Mr. Ceri Davies, helpfully corroborated by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), they are sitting on surplus assets out of which they can make a bomb.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:If they are surplus. What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Here again, we have the useful support of Mr. Ceri Davies, who estimates that 40 per cent. of NHS assets will be surplus to requirements. I have travelled round as many health authorities as has any other member of the Committee, but I know of none that could cheerfully put its hand on its heart and say that 40 per cent. of its land and buildings were surplus to requirements. Any surplus assets that they may have are usually mirrored across the road by hospitals crammed to overflowing and unable to cope with the pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman makes it sound terribly sinister. I can give him an example of a hospital in which this works and has worked effectively for the benefit of patients. I am happy to invite the hon. Gentleman to visit Harlow, and if he accepts my invitation, I shall take him round the Princess Alexandra hospital. Because of the good management of the West Essex health authority, land that is surplus to requirements has been sold off, producing an additional £35 million, which was spent on hospitals, and making possible the construction of accommodation for the elderly. Surely the hon. Gentleman should welcome that; or does he deprecate it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I welcome the hon. Gentleman's intervention and the sedentary interventions of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, because they confirm that this debate on capital charges is about pressurising health authorities to dispose of assets. Having read the stark observations of Mr. Ceri Davies, I admit to harbouring the suspicion that he may be a disinformation officer who is seeking to sow confusion and alarm in our ranks, but it is now clear from the interventions that what Mr. Ceri Davies said is wholly correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When assets are genuinely surplus to requirements, there is no point in the Health Service or any other public-sector body retaining them. It is then wholly rational to sell the assets and recycle the proceeds into another service, thereby promoting renewal of the service. That is not what we object to. We object to an entirely fresh and artificial accounting device that is intended to increase the charges on the use of buildings and land in order to tip health authorities into selling land and properties that they would not otherwise sell. That is the only basis on which one can make sense of Mr. Davies' observations.

I shall predict the hospitals that are most at risk of being sold, and they are those that are the particular concern of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, because he is responsible for administering the Government's programme on care in the community for patients who are discharged from mental health hospitals. Mental health hospitals have been sold at an increasing rate over the past decade, and are likely to be sold at an accelerating rate under the capital charges system. An interesting feature of the mental illness sector is that the cost of its patients is less than that of patients in the acute sector. The cost per patient in mental health hospitals is about one quarter of the cost per patient in the acute sector; and as those hospitals will be valued on the same basis, the capital charge per patient in the mental health sector will be four times the charge in the acute sector. As those hospitals will be valued on the same basis, the capital charge per patient in the mental health sector will be four times that charged in the acute sector. Health authority managers who are troubled by their capital charges will look for assets to dispose of and will conclude that the best way to reduce the equation of capital charge and revenue will be to dispose first of mental health hospitals, leading to all the pressure on care in the community with which we are wearily familiar.

Finally, I come to the last reason for our concern—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman's dialectic is extraordinary. He makes an accusation, repeats it on several occasions, brings no evidence to support that accusation and then tries to convince the Committee that it has been substantiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the hon. Gentleman's speech of nearly half an hour, he has not managed to produce one shred of evidence, or point to any part of the clause that suggests that anything other than surplus assets will be sold off. The clause will not encourage hospital trusts, the NHS or any other body to dispose of assets that they need. Will the hon. Gentleman please produce the evidence to support his accusation before he sits down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hesitate to inflict my half-hour speech on the Committee again. If the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) refers to the report of our proceedings when it is published on Thursday he will find that my speech was studded with quotations from people who have considered the matter more deeply, I suspect, than the hon. Gentleman, giving their candid estimate of what will result from these capital charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the course of our proceedings I would be interested to hear from the hon. Member for Gainsborough about one health authority whose management currently believes that 40 per cent. of its land and buildings are surplus to requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we have grave anxiety about many of the Bill's proposals. Clause 18(4) will create an immense and pointless complication for the Health Service, which is now relatively simple to administer with its minimal bureaucracy. At its most innocuous, clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>691</span>
18(4) presents us with a massive recycling operation. If we apply the figure of 8 per cent. to existing-use value across the whole valuation of England, we are talking about £1.5 billion. At its most minimal, subsection (4) provides for £1.5 billion to be given to health authorities in order that they may repay £1.5 billion. If the administration of that process is kept lean, efficient and tight, and costs only 1 per cent. of the total turnover, we are still talking about an additional £150 million to administer this utterly pointless recycling of funds. It will be based on an asset register of immense length, renewed every three years, and will require the valuation of every property and piece of equipment in the Health Service. In turn, that will add to the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These workings will be bureaucratic and expensive and will result in unfair competition. Indeed, they are designed to be unfair as between DHAs, hospitals and private sector NHS trusts. In spite of the intervention from the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, I fear that this will increase, and is designed to increase, the rate of hospital closures, especially in inner-city areas where land values are highest and, sadly, where the social need is greatest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Parliamentary Under-Secretary responds to the debate I have no doubt that he will give us a competent, technical explanation for the inclusion of clause 18(4). However, we are looking for more than a technical explanation. We want to know how the Government can possibly justify introducing this immense, cumbersome enterprise, which is likely to close many hospitals and put the rest at a competitive disadvantage in the new market of health care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I will take to heart the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). It might help if I intervene at this stage and perhaps respond later to any points of substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) described the proposal as an immense and pointless complication. I profoundly disagree. I hope that my hon. Friends will support my belief that we are proposing a significant change that will improve the quality of patient care. I do not argue for the change on narrow, technical, accounting bases. It is not the product of finicky accountant minds in the Department of Health or the Treasury; it is about improving the quality of health care in the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the convenience of the Committee, I will explain how capital charges will operate. The hon. Member for Livingston asked about valuation. We are in the middle of a valuation exercise that will be completed by 31 March, and which will value all assets—land and buildings—within the National Health Service. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that these would be assets, individually or collectively, with a value of more than £1,000. May I again make it plain, as I did in an earlier debate on the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon), that we do not propose that capital charges should apply to gifted assets although it is important for health authorities
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>692</span>
to depreciate gifted assets and account for them in their own books simply because, when a gifted asset expires, it is obviously important that a health authority consider its replacement. Accounting for gifted assets is an internal exercise, not part of the recycling of money that the hon. Gentleman mentioned and which is not part of the capital charges scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Will the Minister explain the meaning of a gifted asset? He is aware that the state-run Snapethorpe hospital in my constituency was given to the people of Wakefield by a benefactor. I assume that that is a gifted asset, in his terms. I am thinking of an example of public subscription for an asset. In the past, hospitals were set up by public subscription. Are they an example of a gifted asset?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The definition of a gifted asset is essentially an asset that has been gifted since vesting day, 1948, and for which public subscription or voluntary or charitable organisations' funds have paid. We are not talking of the many hospitals that were established through great benefaction. They became part of the National Health Service estate in 1948, and are part of the capital charging scheme. At an earlier sitting, the hon. Member for Halifax mentioned a scanner. If such a gift is provided by public subscription, it will not be part of the capital charges scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Mon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave an easy definition of a gift. Will he also define assets raised by public subscription but contributed to in equal amount by the Government. I am thinking of provision for hospices whereby, if a certain sum was provided by the local population, the Government would match it pound for pound. How would that be treated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The logic follows that the proportion that is paid for publicly will be part of the capital charges scheme and the voluntarily gifted part will not. Part assets as well as whole assets will count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston asked for the latest estimate of aggregate capital charges. I cannot give him that, because the valuation exercise is not completed. However, I assure him that I shall place in the Library as soon as possible after 31 March the results of our valuation so that he will have the figures, by district authority and in aggregate, for the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alien McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:On the question of hospice-type buildings and equipment funded partly by voluntary contributions and partly by the Health Service, and used as NHS premises, is the Minister saying that there will have to be complete cataloguing of what has been provided voluntarily and of what the NHS has provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Yes. That is usually done. We are talking now of capital, not revenue. There is much revenue support by voluntary organisations. When capital has been acquired, whether in the form of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>693</span>
equipment, land or buildings, by means of a gift, that proportion, part or whole, would not be part of the capital charging scheme. It is possible to apportion. Indeed, many voluntary organisations are proud of their involvement in raising money and insist on knowing what their money has bought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me describe how we propose that the capital change will be calculated. The hon. Member for Livingston is right that the capital charge is made up of two elements: depreciation and a rate of return. Depreciation will be on current value of assets—on a value which is assigned to an asset taking into account its remaining life, which may be substantial if it is a well constructed hospital. It is based on the open-market value, assuming existing use; so it does not assume, for instance, that Guy's hospital can be sold for commercial office redevelopment. It does not assume that a district general hospital can be sold for housing redevelopment, in which case the values might be considerably higher. It assumes continued use of the site for hospital services, which puts a substantial restraint upon the valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was not right to assume that the rate of return will be 8 per cent. The figure initially proposed is 6 per cent. The capital charge will include not only an element for depreciation but also a return of 6 per cent. on the current value of land and buildings and equipment. Of course, land is not depreciated but buildings are, so this is a 6 per cent. rate of return on the aggregate of the land and buildings on current values. It is a real rate of return, and the 6 per cent. rate can and, no doubt, will change over the years. The rate is equivalent to the Treasury rate of return needed on non-public trading organisations! It is a rate prescribed by the Treasury and it can and will, I am sure, go up or down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:How does that 6 per cent. compare with commercial rates of return on commercial premises?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is difficult to say, but if one adds an 8 per cent. inflation rate, one arrives at a 14 per cent. nominal cash rate of return. It depends which sector one looks at, but I should have thought that the rates were broadly comparable. If the hon. Gentleman asked for the rate of return on private hospitals, I would have to seek advice, but I think that a 14 per cent. nominal rate of return, which comes from adding an assumed rate of current inflation, provides a broadly comparable rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For directly managed units, we propose a system under which capital charges are calculated for the unit and paid to the RHA, which is the landlord for the Health Service. The capital charges will therefore be paid to the RHAs and in aggregate will be recycled back to the purchasing or commissioning authorities—the DHAs. The hon. Member for Livingston is right: there is 100 per cent. recycling of the funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me how districts which have higher land and building values, such as inner London, will be compensated for those higher values.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>694</span>
The hon. Gentleman anticipated the assurance which I was going to give him—that the system will start by the commissioning authorities being fully compensated for the higher values of the land and buildings within their district which they use for their local residents. In other words, to start with we shall make sure that the higher costs inevitably involved in, for example, central London are reflected in the amount of funds allocated to the DHAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston is right that, over time, we intend to move to a full system of weighted capitation for the allocation of RHAs to DHAs, including the element of recycled funds for capital charges. The hon. Gentleman asked how long the process would take. I cannot give him an estimate and do not intend to, but my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health has made it plain that we intend to move to full weighted capitation for Department of Health allocations to RHAs over a three-year period. We have started that process for 1990–91 by moving one third of the way towards full weighted capitation for regions. It will take another two years to complete the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set no timetable for the completion of full weighted capitation allocation to districts. There are two reasons for that. First, there will almost certainly be other factors which regions will have to take into account in allocating funds to districts. When allocating funds to regions, my right hon. and learned Friend takes into account only four factors, other than the number or residents in the region. He takes demography into account, because the older the population the more expensive the hospital is. He takes morbidity into account, based on the standardised mortality rates for the region. He also takes into account the relative cost of providing services when making allocations to the Thames regions, and the proportion of patients in long-stay mental illness and mental handicap hospitals. Regions with a higher than average proportion of patients in such hospitals receive a slightly higher allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to regions allocating to districts there are other factors, which may include social deprivation. As I said earlier, tourism could also be included. It inevitably brings pressure on accident and emergency services at certain times of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not been prescriptive about how long the period will be for any region before there is a system of full weighted capitation. It may take several years, but whether it will be three years, five years or seven years will depend upon the problems which the region has in moving districts to it. We do not want to precepitate changes because we recognise that where there are relative gainers there are relative losers. We must move slowly and manage the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) the assurance which he seeks, which is that there will be a specific timetable for the elimination of the discrimination, as it were, in allocating the recycled capital charges and moving to a full and fair system of weighted capitation. It will take time. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>695</span>
shall watch how the system progresses and manage the change carefully. I shall give way to the hon. Gentlemen before I come on to refuting his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I look forward to that. May I pick up the Under-Secretary on one point? He said that districts which have hospitals with high land values and, therefore, high capital charges will be fully compensated and that that may continue for some time—indeed, at present for an indefinite period. What would happen if districts which received that revenue looked at the hospitals on their doorsteps which are selling health care as providers, which reflected a high capital charge in their contracts, and decided that it would be better to spend the money in a hospital two districts away which had a lower capital charge and therefore a lower contract price? The DHA covering the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman), for instance, might decide to opt for Gillingham, where plainly the capital charge for a hospital would be lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the transitional period, will there be some mechanism by which the DHAs which receive compensation for capital charges will be obliged to spend it in the hospitals which gave rise that high level of compensation? If so, what has happened to the market in health care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:We shall fund the DHAs to enable them to maintain existing referral patterns initially. It would be perfectly proper for the DHAs—it is their responsibility—to start thinking about the options available to them, for example, for elective surgery. No pressure, however will be put on DHAs to commence the movement of, for example, elective surgery patients from hospital A, which might be in the inner city, to hospital B, which might be out in the suburbs. That process will be for the DHAs to consider, after consulting their local medical committee and seeking the views of the general practitioners, as we have made plain. There will be no pressure upon DHAs to send patients from high-value areas to low-value areas. I hope that DHAs will consider cost when contemplating changes in contracts, but cost is not the only consideration, of course. Quality, ease of travel and the views of the GPs who refer must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid Kent) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I assure my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State that I draw considerable comfort from what he has said. One of the two DHAs in my constituency has for many years suffered disproportionately from archaic and substantially obsolescent draw of some of the great London hospitals and London DHAs, which bears no relation whatever to the shift of population in recent years or to the genuine demands of local people in my area. I hope that he can assure me that one purpose of the new system is gradually to enable local hospital provision to reflect modern conditions. The present system grossly distorts the allocation of funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Our proposals on weighted capitation will in due course reflect the movement of populations from inner city areas to suburbs and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>696</span>
shires. The fairer allocation of funds will take into account various factors. As for capital charges, we feel it right that the cost of service provided is one element that DHAs should take into account and that it is perfectly proper for elective surgery in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are important safeguards. The patient must favour being referred, in cases of elective surgery, to another hospital instead of to his local hospital—to which the DHA might wish to send him under a contract, and the GP must be supportive. Despite those safeguards my hon. Friend is right to say that the cost of hospital provision must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:May I question the Minister further about capital charges and the effect on services in London. In Maidstone, the value of land is one quarter of the value of the land on which Guy's hospital stands. Therefore it will be much cheaper to provide a contract for elective surgery in Maidstone for people living in south-east London because the charges will reflect a lower capital charge. But will this not cause pressure on south-east London DHAs, which will be faced with charges that reflect high London land charges? Will they not try, because of cost, to send patients to Maidstone or Brighton or other places where land is cheaper than in central London. Will not the cost factor alone lead to patients who require general district services being bussed out to be treated many miles from home? Will that not, in turn, mean the large London hospitals being forced to fall back on specialist services such as heart, kidney and transplanation work to meet their capital charges? Will that not be the developing pattern of health care in London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is a fact of life that running a hospital in very cramped conditions such as those at Guy's and, to a certain extent, St Thomas's is expensive. Land is costly, as are salaries and the costs of installing equipment in such cramped conditions. The hon. Lady cannot deny that inner city hospital provision is relatively expensive by comparison with, say, Maidstone. Therefore, over a fairly extended period, it must be right for inner London DHAs to consider placing some of their contracts for elective surgery in hospitals that are further outside their district boundaries than they would otherwise do. I do not disguise that pressure. It is good management of the Health Service and a sensible way of expanding scarce resources for hospital services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made it plain to the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman), who perhaps was not listening, that no pressure would be put on inner London DHAs to shift patients because capital charges will be recycled to districts with higher land values. Therefore DHAs will be able to maintain existing referral patterns. The option for the coming years of sending some patients, with their agreement, for more efficient, quicker and perhaps better quality service, in less hurried circumstances, is all to the good, and of advantage to the Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:May we move from the distortion in London and look a little further afield? The Under-Secretary spoke as though referring to a static position, but there must be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>697</span>
planning for future services. As the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is aware, for a variety of reasons, late planning is taking place in a constituency that affects both of us. Is it not true that land values are tending already to push decision making on new provision away from the best location in terms of community demand and patient need, and will not the system that the Minister outlined in detail distort choice of location of new hospitals—an important enough aspect for accident and emergency services, and extemely important in many other circumstances? Is not this a financial arrangement that will make the driving force in the planning of hospital services the placing of patient care, with the planning of integrated services within a DHA coming much lower down the list of priorities than values and the considerations that have been mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The answer is no. An examination of the reorganisation of services that my right hon. and learned Friend announced for Riverside health authority and the proposals that we hope to announce soon for Parkside health authority, will show that we have massive capital expenditure plans for new hospitals in inner London. One reason that DHAs are oble to finance construction of hospitals in relatively high value areas is—apart from the evident need to provide hospital services where people live—the fact that the land released from the rationalisation of hospitals is of relatively high value. It will be seen from the Riverside and Parkside proposals that the value of the sites released to rebuild large modern hospitals contributes largely to the high cost. There is a trade-off between the higher cost of construction and new land against the higher value of the land released.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the Minister for giving way again. He has explained what could happen. Please will he explain the mechanism by which it will happen and through which the health authorities, in approving the plan he describes, will have the knowledge to be able to ensure that it happens?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The DHAs are responsible for drawing up plans for the building of new hospitals. I shall come to the differential pressures on new capital expenditure. The DHAs will obviously want new or improved hospital provision within their boundaries to serve those who live there. This applies in inner London or in rural Wales. It is the responsibility of the RHA and the Secretary of State to consider those proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made two points. First, I said that there is a mechanism whereby new capital construction is to a certain extent protected in the inner-city areas because land released tends to be of a higher value. Secondly, there is a natural pressure on district health authorities to ensure that a hospital is built where people live—not miles away.

Sending patients for elective surgery— for example for varicose veins, hip replacement or eye surgery—to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>698</span>
hospitals at the margins in the suburbs or the shires is a more sensible sue of limited resources in the Health Service, provided, of course, that the patients agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I thank the Minister for his lucid explanation. In many ways, the exercise is bookkeeping in so far as the figures are notional. Money will not actually transfer; it will in effect be a contribution from Government to pay servicing costs. Is that an immutable principle? Will there be a future attempt to reduce the Government contribution to cover the capital charge servicing costs, although that might not seem logical at this stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:There are no proposals to alter the basic principle in such a way that the capital charges paid by hospitals to the RHA are not fully 100 per cent., recycled by the RHAs back to the districts, the commissioning authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Is it inconceivable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Nothing is inconceivable. The Government have no proposals other than a fully recyclable process of levying and reallocating capital charges. I shall speak about NHS trusts in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston asked me three questions; the first was about the principle of level playing fields. In essence, his argument was that in the public sector the charges are based on current values but some private hospitals depreciate on historic costs. I do not recognise the professional body or the name that he cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More hospitals in the private sector use current or replacement cost. I believe that that is better practice, and so do many of the professional bodies. The private sector has been moving from historic to current cost depreciation over the past 20 years. The move started as a result of high inflation under the Labour Government and has accelerated since then. But that is not the point. The point is that private hospitals, even if they account on historic cost, will price on current cost. There is a difference between book-keeping and the reality of the market place, which is pricing. The point made by the hon. Member for Livingston may be right, but it is irrelevant. Pricing is what counts, and it will be on current cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second question was about NHS trusts. He asked me to clarify how we can compare capital charges for directly managed hospitals with trusts. There is a difference, and the hon. Gentleman is right to question it. The opening capitalisation of NHS trusts will be based upon the value then—not in the future—of the land and buildings transferred. We are not transferring surplus land or buildings to trusts. There will be a lean transfer in which we shall take out any assets and land that could be sold over the next two or three years. We shall capitalise the trusts, therefore, at that opening value, and divide it between interest-bearing debt and private dividend capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston asked what would happen when the land, buildings and equipment are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>699</span>
revalued in time. If the value of the assets is increased when they are revalued, the increase in the valuation will go not to the capitalisation to which I referred but to a revaluation reserve. The hon. Gentleman may say, "Ah, but that means there will be inequity. The NHS trust hospital will be able to charge lower prices than those that are directly managed." That is not so, because the requirement placed upon NHS trusts will be that, first, they must depreciate their assets at current value. That is no different from directly managed hospitals except that they keep the depreciation. They are responsible for their own capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a 6 per cent. rate of return must be earned on the current value of the assets, whatever the opening capitalisation. That must be paid to my right hon. and Friend the Secretary of State in the form of loan interest or public dividend capital payments. It does not matter how the amount is paid, but one year must be taken with another to earn that rate of return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston will accept that there is a level playing field between trusts and directly managed hospitals. The depreciation charge will be kept. We must ensure that DHAs have enough funds from the Secretary of State to purchase services from NHS trust hospitals. To ensure the capital expenditure saved by the Department of Health—it will not pay for the capital expenditure for the replacement of assets in NHS trust hospitals because it will have the money already through depreciation— my right hon. and learned Friend must assign part of what would otherwise have been the capital expenditure allocation to the Health Service to RHAs to allocate to districts. The 6 per cent. rate of return paid by loan interest or public dividend capital payments to the Secretary of State and to the Treasury must be recycled back through the RHAs to the DHAs to give them enough money to purchase services from trusts on behalf of NHS patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third and most important point relates to maintenance and the differences that capital charges will make to new capital expenditure projects. Hon. Members may ask why we seek to introduce what is undeniably a complicated proposal. I hope that I have explained how it works. Many of my hon. Friends are interested in this major change—[hon. Members: "They are not here!"]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall draw my remarks quickly to a close. We are introducing a significant change in that for the first time in the public sector, capital will truly be differentiated from revenue. That means that when capital expenditure considerations are analysed and considered, those who plan the building of new hospitals and facilities will, for the first time, have to take into account the revenue consequences of their actions. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a significant maintenance backlog of at least £1 billion in NHS hospitals. We want better maintained hospitals and this reform, and another to which I shall refer later, will help. The National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee and the Department of Health have considered the figures carefully. The full details of the maintenance backlog of the estate will be known once we have the 1989–90 Körner statistics for all districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>700</span>
I have answered one question from the hon. Member for Peckham and I shall respond more fully in due course. The maintenance backlog has built up since 1948. The introduction of capital charges will help in dealing with maintenance and the maintenance backlog because new hospital buildings will have to be properly depreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital charges will enable more informed decisions to be taken about whether to build new hospitals or to renovate old ones. Our Victorian forefathers were excellent builders; They built hospitals to last. It is economic nonsense to demolish a soundly constructed building merely because it looks shabby. My argument is that in the past, when building a new hospital for £100 million, the revenue consequences of maintaining it in future were ignored. I forecast that with the introduction of capital charges, one or two new hospital building programmes will be reconsidered and that the refurbishment and modernisation of existing hospitals—indeed, more hospitals—will become more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Will my hon. Friend confirm that what he is really saying is that he is seeking a level playing field between the expenditure of capital, with its subsequent revenue consequences, and the revenue consequences of maintenance, for example, of existing buildings, and contending that this would be a much better use and distribution of assets than previously applied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is right. From 1 April this year, we intend to introduce what we call a shadow system for capital charging. No cash will pass but we shall commence the system. Therefore all capital expenditure decisions from 1 April 1990 will have to pass the test of proper revenue provision for the maintenance of buildings in future. Health Service managers can become familiar through the introduction of the shadow charging system with the principles underlying the schemes that are proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by dealing with mental illness hospitals. The hon. Member for Livingston said that there were many such hospitals in relatively poor condition, built perhaps at the end of the 19th century, and that some of them had been badly maintained. He implied that the capital charging system might complicate either their proper refurbishment or consideration of their future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are especially concerned about the state of some of the Victorian psychiatric hospitals, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State announced recently a capital fund of £50 million, designed specifically to address the problems of building new facilities in the community for the mentally ill and those with a mental handicap, in advance of the hospitals closing. The health authorities will have the cash once they have sold the land and the hospitals to build new asylums or new hospital hostels, or to acquire new accommodation in the community. They cannot sell the land and the hospitals now as the patients are in them, and accordingly they cannot make progress.

The capital loans fund is a major new advance, and over the next three years it will accelerate the building of facilities within the community for mentally ill people. Only when those facilities are in place can we consider closing dilapidated psychiatric hospitals, which are very costly to maintain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

These capital charge proposals and the capital loan fund have no relevance for that project because the South East Thames RHA properly realises that there must be discipline. When new buildings are constructed there must be a mechanism for ensuring their proper maintenance, and I am advised that in terms of the preparation for the King's 2000 project the capital charge that will arise has been and will be properly provided for in the budget. As it is a plan which has been properly prepared, it will not suffer any deleterious effect; indeed, the future maintenance of the building will be safeguarded by our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the length of my reply. I am anticipating the debate to some extent, and I hope that I have pre-empted part of it and therefore saved the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members want both brighter and better hospitals. We want them to be maintained properly, and our capital charging system will ensure that. We want brighter hospitals, and we have set aside £1.2 million this year for hospital redecoration and refurbishment of the casualty department at King's hospital, for example. If that work has not already commenced, it will commence shortly, I understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set aside £10 million for next year to improve the quality of the service provided for patients in our hospitals, including the physical environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend those proposals to the Committee, and I hope that with the assurances that I have offered, the hon. Member for Livingston will not seek to press what probably was a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I thank the Minister for giving us an early insight into the Government's thinking on the provisions set out in the clause, after the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) prompted him to do so. It will have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>702</span>
useful to the Committee in considering how to probe further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to consider one issue which has not yet been raised in the debate—namely, how the introduction of capital charging will effect the Cinderella services. I am thinking especially of family planning clinics. Each AHA that I am aware of has cut funds for the clinics over the past two years, and there are some startling figures about the effect of that. One fear is that if a DHA cuts funds for a particular service, when it includes the provision for capital charging, as it must, it may be the straw that breaks the camel's back, and certain outlying family planning clinics may close. The danger of travelling down that road must be explored, and we would welcome the Government's assurance that the principle of capital charging and the way in which it will operate within each DHA will not adversely affect family planning provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important lesson which has been learnt about family planning clinics is that their location is vital for their success. All the women, and some of the men, who go to the clinics for advice need them to be locally-based so that they can reach them quickly and so that women with children do not have to leave their children at home. The success of many clinics has been due to their location as well as to the nature of the advice that they have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to put it on the record that if family planning clinics are not available in a particular locality, patients are reluctant to use the alternative on offer to them—namely, their local GP. All the evidence suggests that family planning patients would much prefer to go to a clinic to get advice rather than to GPs. In the clinic the person attending is treated as an equal a without the more formal doctor-patient relationship which inevitably applies with GPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important also to recognise that GPs and family planning clinics approach family planning differently, but I will not go down that road because I am sure you would call me to order, Dame Janet, for straying wide of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DHAs are now under pressure to cut their budgets—the DHA in the area which I represent has already cut its budget that is allocated for family planning this year—and the danger is that with the introduction of capital charging, they will see an opportunity to centralise family planning clinics in large hospitals, which tend to be in rural areas and thus involve long journeys for some people. There will be a loss of the personal touch, which is essential in a service of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures show an alarming increase in teenage pregnancies and illegitimate births, and there is direct correlation between those increases and the way in which family planning clinics are being starved of funds. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that the Government are aware of the potential problem and that, when necessary, they will issue guidance to DHAs that capital charging should not be seen as an opportunity to close valuable clinics in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

beginning to get to know the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). He is, of course, a remarkable parliamentary performer, but his skills sometimes tempt him to adopt positions so inherently hollow and devoid of sense that only his undoubted debating talent make them seem tenable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it was this morning. I listened to the hon. Gentleman's speech with growing curiosity to see what form of capital charge or depreciation he would favour, and I was amazed when he sat down having given the Committee the clear message that he favoured no form of capital charging or depreciation. It is impossible to conceive of the management of any enterprise with assets of somewhere between £10 billion and £20 billion—we do not know the exact figures, but let us use the figures that the hon. Gentleman used this morning—having no notion of the cost of capital. It is inconceivable that any organisation could be expected to make rational economic decisions or sensible substitutions between, for example, labour-intensive and capital-intensive procedures, without knowing about the cost of capital, or assuming that the cost of capital is zero.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary to hear the hon. Member for Livingston say that it is sensible for managers to continue to manage the Health Service at regional, district and hospital levels, without any means of ensuring that they do not retain assets that are surplus to requirements or that they use their assets as effectively and fully as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument—I assume that he speaks on behalf of all Labour Members—is that if an enterprise of this nature should not have a system of capital charging or depreciation, no enterprise of any kind should have it. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman believes that all economic decisions should be made in the absence of any knowledge of the cost of capital. Perhaps he is a closet Bolshevik who would like to base the whole British economy on the Soviet command system, in which capital is allocated from the centre and is entirely a free good for managers. That would be an extraordinary conclusion, but it is the only logical conclusion that one can draw from the purely negative position that the hon. Member for Livingston adopted this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Perhaps the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State dealt extremely well with a number of the detailed issues that arose in connection with the Government's proposed capital charge, and I wish to reinforce his argument about a depreciation charge based on current or replacement cost. Two points arise. First, a different sanction—the market sanction—applies to private sector hospitals that do not price on the basis of replacement or current cost. If a private sector hospital—or indeed, any business in any sector— thought that historic cost depreciation was sufficient provision against the need to replace capital equipment, that hospital would soon disappear from the face of the earth. Any business, if it has to stay in business, has to ensure that the machinery, equipment or real estate on which it depends will remain available to it, and its pricing policy must reflect the genuine replacment cost of its capital equipment. Private sector managers, who face the ultimate sanction of bankruptcy, are alive to that, and inefficient managers who are lulled into an illusion of historic cost depreciation disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>705</span>
Of course, there are no such sanctions for hospitals that are owned by DH As, and it is therefore important that a realistic notion of depreciation—that is, a replacement or current cost depreciation—is imposed on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another feature of the choice of basis for depreciation. The choice of current or replacement cost introduces a substantial and continuing inducement to invest and modernise. That must be in the interest of the Health Service and patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why. Under the current cost convention, hospitals which replace equipment or invest in the most modern and productive plant will be faced with the same level of depreciation charge as those which do not. The difference is that those which modernise and invest in the most productive equipment will enjoy a higher rate of throughput and, therefore, the higher rates of revenue that that improved level of capital investment will give. Those that have not taken that investment decision will, under the cost convention that my hon. Friend the Minister is to impose, face the same level of depreciation charge, which will be crippling to any hospital that has not taken the requisite capital investment decisions in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are introducing a system that will ensure that hospitals will have a continuing inducement to invest, to modernise and to introduce the latest equipment. That must be good news for patients. If there is one principle that unites the Opposition and Conservative Members it is that we must look at every provision in the Bill against the highest criterion: the interests of patients. Looked at against that highest criterion, I believe that the choice that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State made about the accounting depreciation convention he will impose on hospitals in the public sector is the right one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to what was said by the hon. Member for Livingston, about which I made a small amount of play in his absence. I am sorry about that, but it was not my fault that he chose that moment to leave the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman is seriously telling the Committee, and through the Committee, the country, that a future Government of whatever political hue should manage an enormous, growing NHS with a commitment to fixed assets, real estate, plant and so on, which, on his own figures, must be worth between £10 billion and £20 billion—we do not know if the figures are right because we do not know that the asset base is—without any notion of depreciation or the cost of capital, the hon. Gentleman is abdicating in the most explicit way possible any lingering pretention he had to being regarded by the British people as serious manager of the NHS or of any other significant enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:After the contribution of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), it is worth restating that as far as I am aware we are considering legislation for the NHS. People who listened to the hon. Gentleman's contribution may be forgiven for thinking that he was talking about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>706</span>
something completely different. We have a Government of accountants, stockbrokers and business people and the hon. Gentleman's speech confirmed my concern about the motivation behind this legislation. The hon. Gentleman talked about everything but the issue of caring for patients. We should be worried about that, not business enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the issues that concern ordinary consumers and patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way so early in his speech. I shall be happy to accept any criticism he likes to level at me but I hope that such criticism will be about what I actually said. I said that I was looking at this provision against the highest criterion common to both sides of the Committee; the interests of the patient. It was against that criterion that I weighted the decision of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State to impose the depreciation convention upon the hospital sector and decided that he was right to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:If the hon. Gentleman reads his contribution in the Official Report he will realise that he said very little about patients' interests. The bulk of his contribution was about business enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in the clause cause concern as they relate to the patient. I want to bring the Committee back to those provisions for the NHS as they relate to my constituents and their families as patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), which was not refuted by the Under-Secretary of State or Conservative Members. He specifically mentioned issues relating to individual health authorities. My hon. Friend mentioned my authority in Wakefield and said that the figures he put forward—they were not contradicted by anyone while I was in the Committee Room—were for a £16 million revenue loss to the Wakefield health authority. On top of that there will be £5.5 million capital charges. I want to ask who paid for those capital assets in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened in the Minister's speech to ask about gifted assets and was given an assurance that gifted assets received by the NHS will not be affected by the provisions for capital charges. That is no assurance to me. The most modern hospital in my constituency, the Snapethorpe hospital, was donated to the people of Wakefield in the 1930s, before the inception of the NHS. My hon. Friends the Members for Livingston and for Peckham (Ms. Harman) have been there and so has the Secretary of State. The fight to keep Snapethorpe hospital open has gone on for 10 years. The hospital was donated to Wakefield by a benefactor and, presumably, it will not be covered by the exemption on gifted assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clayton hospital in my constituency was provided directly from public subscription. The money came from trade unions and individual gifts. Clayton hospital will not be exempt because it was provided pre-NHS. Pinderfields general hospital and Stanley Royd hospital will also not be exempt. The Stanley Royd hospital was the first proper lunatic asylum for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>707</span>
the West Riding of Yorkshire. Both hospitals were paid for by ordinary people in my constituency and elsewhere in West Yorkshire through the poor law rates. I am concerned because those are our assets and we should not be charged for something that we have already paid for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is precisely what the provisions will mean, because the exemption on gifted assets does not cover those that were given to the health service in my area before the inception of the NHS in the 1940s. Local people have paid for those assets, and capital charges mean that they will pay yet again in various ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two points need to be drawn to the Government's attention and exposed for what they are. The guidance on the clause from the Department of Health says that the amount being collected by RHAs will the added to revenue funds allocated by the Government. That is another means of devolving funding along the lines of that provided for in the Health and Medicines Act 1988. It is also another example of local people having to pay for a health service that has by and large been funded by central taxation, and of the Exchequer passing on the burden of raising funds for the NHS to local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolved fund raising in my constituency makes Wakefield the only health authority in the country to charge undertakers for the service of measuring bodies in the mortuary. I find that astonishing, but that is the level that we have reached. That charge will be passed on to the bereaved. We are talking about imposing more charges on patients and relatives in circumstances such as these. That is part of the process that leads to local people paying several times over for a service that was previously paid for directly from central taxation. In particular, poorer people will be affected by the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) was the way in which the provision will encourage the sale of capital assets. The note from the Department of Health says:
	<br><q><p>"It will provide an incentive to managers to use their capital assets more efficiently."</p></q>
Certainly in my area such an incentive is not needed. Snapethorpe hospital is a classic example. I found out that before the health authority resolved to close it, plans had been drawn up to build houses on the hospital site, before the CHC had been consulted and before the Secretary of State had decided to formally agree to that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause worries me because it seems to be a property developer's charter. It is an encouragement to sell NHS land and assets to produce local funds and it excuses central Government from the duty to raise appropriate funds for the NHS. I am worried about hospitals, such as Snapethorpe, because the clause represents an additional incentive for local authorities to disregard the wishes of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My predecessor, Walter Harrison, presented Parliament with a 100,000-signature petition in defence of his constituency's hospital. I am proud to say that we are still struggling to keep that hospital for local people. The Secretary of State seems to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>708</span>
surprised, but years ago he went to that hospital and agreed to its temporary closure. The Opposition and 100,000 Wakefield people disagree with that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that the Government's depreciation proposals may increase the commitment of hospitals and DHAs to fixed capital? However, the mix of fixed assets may change; there may be less real estate and more diagnostic equipment. Is not the hon. Gentleman happy that such decisions will be more rational in the future, and may provide more life-saving equipment and reduce redundant real estate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not arguing that health authorities should retain useless assets when the money from them could be better used. I am worried however, that assets that the local public health care consumers regard as having useful health care purpose will be disposed of. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston spoke of the Department of Health guidance notes which state that the clause will,
	<br><q><p>"enable the cost of NHS service provision to be evaluated on a more comparable basis with other providers of health care".</p></q>
That is a clear message to those who are worried about present NHS trends. It represents a part of the break up of the NHS into independent competitive units. We can all see that this proposal will be brought in to enable private health care better to compete with the NHS. It is no wonder that the value of shares in private health care shot up when my hon. Friends leaked the Government's proposals. It is clear that the Bill will be beneficial to private sector interests. The clause will give private health care an advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) referred to family planning clinics. The Family Planning Association sent us all a useful brief. There will be an incentive to dispose of clinics especially those in outlying areas, which perform an excellent function and give good service to many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem is that we are heading for a different form of health care based on market forces and business ethics rather than on the collective caring ethics that have underpinned the NHS since its inception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Under-Secretary. In a note circulated to the Committee, my hon. Friend explained that the benefits of the scheme will be to,
	<br><q><p>"increase the awareness of health service managers of the costs of capital … provide an incentive to managers to use their capital assets more efficiently … enable the costs of NHS service provision to be evaluated on a more comparable basis with other providers of health care".</p></q>
I am not an accountant. I carefully read my hon. Friend's note, and I have read the two working papers, but I do not profess to have grasped all the finer points. However, my hon. Friend's speech this morning cleared up many of the doubts and misunderstandings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), claimed that the proposals would encourage the DHAs in the constituencies of some Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>709</span>
members to sell some of their assets. Surely that should be applauded, if, as my hon. Friend the Memeber for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) claimed, DHAs could thereby provide what he called a better mix of care services. My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) explained that some of the assets in his DHA area had been sold, and the proceeds used to benefit users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much depends on how the system will operate. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary pointed out that authorities may have to reconsider some of their plans in the light of the considerations that he outlined. We do not yet know how the system will operate in detail, nor what the valuation of existing assets will be. There is the further question of how to evaluate future assets which an authority might acquire if it proceeded with its plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston said that Bromley DHA which is in my constituency would probably want to dispose of some of its assets, and he may be aware that it has such plans. It has developed a complex series of proposals, which come under the heading of "unconventional financing", and I understand that it is one of the first DHAs to do so. I shall not burden the Committee with the full details of the proposals, but they involve an exchange of sites between the health and the borough authorities, and a package involving a finance house, developers and builders. Under the scheme, the DHA, while retaining some buildings, will relinquish hospital land for residential development. The developers will build for the DHA a new hospital on a different site, which will advantage local residents who will receive better facilities, more quickly and at lower cost than if the DHA had had to use conventional financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about how DHAs will be able to assess the effect of the capital charge on their plans, especially as they will have to work on assets that they have not yet acquired. Much depends on how the system of assessing capital charges will work. If we are not careful, the effect will be to deter authorities from making the best use of their assets, when they should be encouraged to do so. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is familiar with the Bromley proposals and we should encourage other authorities to copy them. However, each authority would have to be clear about the effects on future capital charging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I listened with great care and interest to the Under-Secretary's speech. It was illuminating and helped me to understand the principles behind the proposals, which the Under-Secretary has grasped firmly. He might therefore help me by elucidating them further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I intervened in the Under-Secretary's speech to refer to the 6 per cent. rate, he said that it was broadly comparable with commercial terms. He did not say whether that figure was long term. I believe that it might increase because all hospital sites could be sold under the arrangements—in effect, privatised—although the tenant would remain the NHS. Investing property companies could secure a return based on the figure that the Under-Secretary proposed as the servicing charge on the value of NHS hospitals assets. Will he comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>710</span>
A famous conference took place about a year and a half ago at the Carlton club where that proposition was discussed. The conference was attended by people of Conservative persuasion, and Labour Members were surprised to find that some hospitals even had their own Conservative consultant associations. The conference had some influence on principles behind the Bill. Is it the Government's long-term, perhaps hidden, agenda to pursue the theory that was espoused at that conference by Conservative consultants? They wanted assets to be privatised. If that happened, DHAs, and some trusts, could become tenants of property companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary referred to the basis on which charges or valuations were established. In my constituency there is a small private hospital which was opened in 1983 by Lord Whitelaw. It tried to trade but found it hard to do so, and was subsequently liquidated. The organisation that lost most, I think, was Barclays bank, which lost several million pounds. The company that ran the hospital bought it on the cheap. The buyer reduced the number of beds in the hospital, turned the balance of beds over to general nursing provision and, in effect touted for business throughout the area. I am pleased to say that he did so with little success. If operations in that hospital are costed on the historic cost principle—the Minister said that some private hospitals will work on that basis—it will be based on the historic costs of the acquisition of equipment, land and buildings. Yet, when a DHA allocates money to a local hospital, that hospital will have to take into account not historic cost considerations, but the formula that the Minister has put to the Committee today. That private hospital will have an unfair advantage in the costing of its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that that is the hospital's good fortune, although he might say that it could consider the replacement costs of equipment and buildings. But the buildings were constructed only in 1983. The hospital was brand new. The replacement cost of buildings may not be a consideration that that hospital wants to take into account now. So there is the potential for building into a private hospital's operational cost calculations—historic cost considerations—instead of the formula that will apply to local general hospitals. I put it to the Minister that that may be an advantage to private hospitals. The beds that were converted to general nursing provision for use for acute operations might be converted back, as the private hospital sees the opportunity to increase business on the brand new site that it bought on the cheap and where it acquired most of its equipment on the cheap to the cost of the people who have deposits in Barclay's bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that private hospitals have an unfair advantage in those circumstances? Several private hospitals were in trouble in the early 1980s and what happened to the hospital in my constituency may have happened to other hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened to question the Minister on the recycling of money in what can be deemed a bookkeeping exercise. I asked him whether he could rule out indefinitely the principle of 100 per cent, recycling. He refused to do so. He said that he could

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>711</span>
not give that undertaking for all time. That is an important issue, because despite increasing the commercial rate of return on assets—that is the servicing costs of the valuations placed on assets—the Government might wish to reduce the amount of recycled compensation to pay for the notional servicing costs. It would have the effect of making hospitals on city centre sites, such as St Thomas's across the Thames, relocate. The DHAs, if they are being pressured through a reduction in recycled moneys, might decide that it would be better to move a hospital to a cheaper area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:There is a real possibility of engendering anxiety about this matter, but I do not understand why that should be the result. There is a ring of hospitals in London and each one is much too close to the other. The hospitals serve a population which has declined sharply and they now go touting for business around the south-east area and well beyond to fill their beds. The suggestion that they might relocate to cheaper areas has further merit. In many cheaper areas live people whose income makes it difficult for them to travel long distances, which at present they have to do because of the location of the London hospitals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Let us take as an example St Thomas's hospital, across the river.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is a general hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is the district general hospital for this part of London.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:These great London hospitals, which perform a very valuable service for the NHS, were in their heyday when London's population was much larger and the population of the surrounding counties was smaller. The area which I represent is considerably under-funded, largely because of the dominance of St Thomas's hospital. This means that the elderly in my contituency have to travel 40 miles instead of getting on a bus and going three miles alongside the river to Guy's or King's. My elderly constituents are worth at least as much consideration as those elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
St Thomas's hospital has alway been full when I have been there. I assume that the great majority of patients come from the immediate vicinity of Westminster and Lambeth and other areas immediately around central London. Why should they have to move out of London to meet what the hon. Gentleman says is a problem that exists in his part of Kent?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:What can I say in replay to that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some DHAs will have old buildings, which might have depreciated over a few years, and which are minimally valued. What incentive will they have to build new hospitals? If all the calculations are based on financial considerations, a DHA might be put off constructing a new hospital for fear of incurring a high servicing charge, which would be reflected in the operating costs charged to its patients. A DHA might take that into account when it considered whether to build a new general hospital. That cost would be disproportionately high in a hoapital where inexpensive operations took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members often seem to argue that much of the thought behind the proposal is to induce Health Service Managers to release land that they would not otherwise release, and that those managers can decide whether to release the land only if its value is included in calculations of the costs of operations. When the Public Accounts Committee considered the matter it did not exactly draw that conclusion. When the National Health Service board's accounting officer gave evidence to that Committee, I understood that lists were being drawn up of excess property, and that other pressures were being exerted on DHAs to release land. If that is correct, will the Minister accept that those pressures have not worked, and that land is still being hoarded unnecessarily? That much has been suggested by several Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They include such powerful organisations as the Welsh Development Agency.

I understand that it has said that hospitals do not project the right image to attract go-ahead, modern, clean technology. That, presumably, is because the new technologies would get a whiff of their own mortality from time to time. Will the clause afford a regional or area health authority the clout necessary to ensure that it is not elbowed out of its preferred site because of financial considerations if there is competition? The preferred site for East Glamorgan hospital is Ynysplwm which is near a motorway in a growth area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Financial considerations are relevant to my consituency and to many others. If they become the prime consideration, hospitals will eternally have to look for the second or third best site if their first choice is up for grabs by property developers and worthy organisations such as the Welsh Development Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

People want to know how they will be served by a hospital that has relocated. Will people from Rhondda, for example, have to travel further because they cannot go to the preferred site when the East Glamorgan hospital is relocated? The Welsh Development Agency said that there is probably a better, smaller site nearer the M4. That has serious cost implications for the area health authority. The modular design for new hospitals requires a rectangular site, in this case of about 37 acres. There are other sites—on closed collieries, for example; God knows, there are enough of those in south Wales—on which it would be possible to erect hospitals of a similar size but of a different design. The planning process for a different design would take a year or two longer and there would be a one-off architectural fee for the new hospital.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should like further clarification of the effect of the capital charges on London. I remain anxious lest the high land values in London, reflected in the capital charges for hospital land and buildings, feed their way into high contract prices for services provided by London hospitals. DHAs will be able to get cheaper contracts for health services in the suburbs and towns around London and will send their patients under the contract system to places such as Brighton, Maidstone and Chatham where land values are cheaper, capital charges are lower and therefore contract prices will be lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that GPs will have no veto over where the contracts are made. Patients will have no right to choose somewhere else, if they do not want to travel to where the contract is placed. The Minister gave the examples of operations on hips, eyes and varicose veins. If an elderly person has to go to Maidstone for a hip replacement, it will not be, as the Minister said, "on the margins," if the district general hospital is Guy's or St. Thomas'. It is difficult for elderly people to travel, especially when they are ill; it is also difficult for their relatives to visit them if they have to go a long way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the location of health services will be decided on the basis of the cost of the land on which the hospital is sited. Health services should be where people need them and find it easy to use them. Health service planning should not be based on the cost of land. That will strip London of the district general services and mean that patients will have to be bussed out. To meet the costs of the capital charges large London hospitals will have to rely on a narrow range of specialties. To generate the income to cover the high capital charges they will have to concentrate on specialties that will pull in patients from other districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about the effect of the capital charges on small outlying clinics, such as family planning clinics, child health clinics and well woman clinics. We have heard much about surplus land. Where are the nursing homes? Where are the nurses' homes? Where are the well woman clinics and the family planning clinics? We do not have a problem of surplus land in London. Those facilities need to be developed in local communities. The problem is that all land is valuable in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
DHAs might recognise the need for a well woman clinic somewhere, but might decide that because of the cost of land it would be better to sell the land so that people had to go to their GPs for family planning services or well woman clinic services. A

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>715</span>
Government cannot claim to be interested in choice if those local outlying clinics, which provide a range of services in addition to what GPs provide are taken out of the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) equally apply to Manchester, and the consequences will be similar. Listening to the Minister took me back 20 years to when I was an accountant, and I remember clearly why I left the profession and ultimately went to work in the Health Service. I wanted to work in a profession that dealt with care and need and not making profits on balance sheets. I think that the making of profits is exactly what the Minister has described to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members scoffed when we talked about a 40 per cent. reduction in the assets of the health authorities. That is happening in south Manchester already. With a lack of resources, the health authority there is having to sell off psychiatric homes, transfer elderly person units to housing associations and take all sort of financial measures because it cannot afford to keep the facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to make the real justification for the proposals the fact that they would make managers more susceptible to considering the revenue consequences of developments, particularly of service and maintenance. The only reason why buildings are not being maintained in south Manchester is that year after year revenue allocation has been cut. The first thing that goes is maintenance of buildings because the health authority tries to maintain patient services. It is managing buildings which were constructed many years ago. The managers were not there to make the decisions then; they are having to deal with the assets which they have now, not plans for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the rationalisation proposals, the only way in which South Manchester health authority will be able to fund one site—this is the way in which some people are proposing to go—is if it sells off Withington hospital site. Will the Minister comment on recent developments which have been funded by voluntary and public contributions and say what will happen to those assets? Will the moneys be returned to the people who paid for those assets, when the hospital site is sold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) referred to family planning clinics and the effect of capital charges upon their location. There is no relevance except for units in areas of relatively high land value, and family planning clinics are in no different a position from other units or hospitals. There will undeniably be pressures as a result of capital charging—legitimate pressures, I believe— upon the continued existence of units which are in high-land-value areas, and continued justification

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Minister is saying basically that there will now be pressure to close family planning clinics.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I did not say that family planning clinics will close.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) talked about assets acquired before 1948, and I can tell him that upon the creation of the NHS all hospitals, whatever their origin, became part of the NHS estate. The Member for Livingston would not disagree with that. It was under a Labour Government that those assets came into the Health Service, and they are public assets now. Those that have been gifted since 1948 will be treated differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims). The shadow scheme, which will be in operation in the coming year, is designed to ascertain where there are problems of interpretation. My hon. Friend talked about the Bromley scheme. It is an imaginative proposal that will take account of the need to provide for capital charges in the scheme, but I am sure that that is already being done. If the planners need guidance from the Department, we shall provide it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) asked a number of questions. He asked whether the 6 per cent. figure was likely to increase. It is the current figure, and there is no reason why it should go up. It is a real figure, and if inflation goes up or down it is unlikely to change. There are no proposals to privatise directly managed hospitals, which will be subject to capital charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I asked the Minister about the sites. I said that a site could be owned by a private property company and rented back to the Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) spoke about choosing the site, when there are alternative sites, for building a new hospital. The discipline already applies when the site is being

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>717</span>
purchased, but the hon. Gentleman's comment is relevant when alternative sites are owned by the NHS. The issue has arisen recently in connection with plans in inner London at Riverside and Parkside. It is wholly legitimate for the DHA to take account of the alternative use value—that is, the sale value of sites that will be released in rationalisation, or not used— in its calculation. That is part of the financial calculation. The capital expenditure programme this year is about £1 billion from Department of Health voted funds, together with about £250 million from the sale of surplus assets. That shows the importance of releasing surplus assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) spoke about London. The pressure comes from DHAs in inner London rather than in the outlying parts of the region, where they properly have to consider whether to send patients resident in Maidstone, for example, to Guy's or to a local hospital. That is where there may be a change in the long term, although we shall fund Maidstone and the other districts to allow patients to continue treatment in inner London hospitals in the early years of the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the hon. Members for Wakefield and for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) said that accountants do not care about patients. I merely said that I genuinely care about patient care, as do all the financial staff of the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The debate has been illuminating and valuable, and I hope that my hon. Friends will forgive me if I confine my remarks to responding to some of the Minister's observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the two points that the Minister made in his opening statement. The first was his assurance that gifted assets will not be included in the register for capital charges, although it does not remove from health authorities and hospitals that have received gifted assets the obligation to reflect their value in the prices that they charge for treatment at their hospitals.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>718</span>
Although they do not have to pay for them, the patients who use them and the health authorities that place contracts with those hospitals will have to pay for the value of the gifts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I welcome the Minister's commitment— I take it to be a commitment—that the system provided in clause 9 is on all fours with that provided in this clause, and that the Government will ensure that the rate of interest charged under the public dividend capital under clause 9 will remain equivalent to the rate of interest charged under capital charges under clause 18. We are glad to have that assurance on record, and we shall keep the Government to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the remainder of his response, the Minister did not meet the major anxieties that have been voiced by Opposition Members. He did not respond to our major anxiety that the provision will penalise health authorities that fail to sell land and hospitals. Far from removing the anxiety, the Minister provided two new grounds for anxiety. First, as he recognised, the system will oblige people in inner-city areas to be transferred to lower capital charge areas, so that an increased number of patients will need to move for operations. Secondly, a new anxiety, which I had not anticipated was caused by the Minister's candid admission that the balance of advantage will be tilted between building a new hospital and renovating an old one. The hon. Gentleman told us that one or two buildings would have to be reconsidered, and in the weeks ahead we shall set ourselves the task of teasing out of him which they will be. There are major implications about which we are grievously worried, and which we shall record in a Division on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
