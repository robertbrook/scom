	<p>[Continuation from col. 1156]</p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of Parliament will ask, on behalf of their constituents, organisations, voluntary bodies and social services departments, how much money is spent in the first year on community care and how it has been allocated. The amendment will ensure that they will not be told, "The Department does not collect this information centrally." It is the other side of the coin that gives the Secretary of State, appropriately, wide discretion to look after quality control and other matters that we have discussed. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure me that the Secretary of State will give the answers that the amendment seeks. If he cannot reassure me, I shall demand the full annual report to Parliament, as proposed in the amendment. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health said that to put Ministers into such a straitjacket, especially at the beginning would be undesirable. But it would be more desirable than Members being met with a battery of "We do not collect this information centrally" comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will probably know that the Department of Health makes an annual report to the Select Committee on Social Services on personal social services expenditure by local authorities. Hon. Members may not have been aware of that. By a stretch of the definition, that is in essence, an annual report to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to give my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) the assurance that he wants, but there are two practical problems. First, it is difficult to split personal social services expenditure by local authorities into community care and non-community care. Secondly, within community care it is difficult to split that part which is old money and that which is new money under part III of the Bill. I am sure that my hon. Friend appreciates those practical problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the difficulty facing hon. Members when they ask questions of Ministers and receive the answer, "We do not collect this information centrally." It is partly for good, legitimate reasons that the details of district health authority expenditure should be accounted for locally. Local Members of Parliament should seek that information from local district health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
Nevertheless, I sense the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument. He wants as much information as possible from the Department, especially in the first year. I shall ensure that we do all that we can to give him and other hon. Members as sensible a reply as possible. I anticipate that questions might be asked about much money has been dispersed on certain aspects of care, about the cost of assessment and how many places local authorities have secured in various kinds of home. With those assurances, I hope that my hon. Friend will understand my predicament and will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unreasonable to ask the Minister to provide information that is difficult to obtain. That would result only in false statistics that would distort the future provision of community care. I respect my hon. Friend's willingness to be as open as possible about the issue and, given those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 44 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 45</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO GIVE DIRECTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 623, in page 44, line 45, leave out "either individually or".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise because I seem to have developed a cold today, perhaps as an allergy to television lighting, but I see that that problem has been resolved. It is odd that with Scottish provisions we seem to take three clauses to say what the English manage to say in one. Nevertheless, I shall be as brief as possible, consistent with placing on record Scottish worries and questions in a probing sense, especially through this amendment. No doubt the Minister will respond in kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier today, Ministers were a little worried about the local government response to their views. I assure the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland that he need have no worries about this amendment because it was drafted by COSLA. COSLA's worries, which are similar to those expressed this morning, are that if the clause remains unamended it will give more and more powers to the Secretary of State. When and how would the Secretary of State for Scotland use those powers? Would he police individual local authorities? We envisage that to be the impact of such powers. Is he to be the court of appeal? Does the clause, in effect, ask the Secretary of State to issue individual directions as opposed to general guidelines?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is consistent with the argument that we put forward last week. No Opposition Member would object—quite the reverse—to the Secretary of State giving general guidelines. Indeed, it would be a sign of his interest, something that we have tried to encourage. My position is consistent and I say this to save the Minister from reciting my speech from last week. There is a big difference between inviting the Secretary of State to be involved in a spirit of co-operation in genuine joint planning and giving him the power to direct. Until the Minister replies, we are not sure what those directions will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0982">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1159</span>
The notes on clauses for clause 45 state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This clause gives the Secretary of State a power to issue directions to local authorities as to the way in which they should exercise any of their social work functions."</p></blockquote>
They also state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is an entirely new provision"—</p></blockquote>
it is important to note that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which will extend the Secetary of State's powers to control the nature and direction of local authority provision of social work services."</p></blockquote>
That is a wide-ranging provision. There is a danger, and COSLA and Scottish local authorities would share this view, that the provision could be used, as the document implies, for any social work powers under the social work legislation, including powers relating to children on probation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper was hastily introduced and, if there was consultation, it was done in a week. We have had the Children Act 1989 which, for the most part, does not apply to Scotland. Nobody expected that, if we were to consider powers involving child care and other important matters, such provisions would be introduced in a Bill such as this. Does the Minister have such things in mind? If so, with what other aspects of social work do the Government intend to deal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters seem well outwith the scope of community care as envisaged by people in Scotland. Why is the Bill drafted in this way? Why did the Government seemingly change their mind and decide that the Bill should go outwith community care? If they were dealing exclusively with community care, as most people expected, the powers would relate to assessment, the regulations and monitoring, the very issues which led us to complain last week. The Minister will recall that—if he has forgotten, he has the 	<i>Hansard</i> report in front of him—the Government refused to take those issues on board. They declaimed to use their powers in a spirit of consultation, joint planning and co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, we heard the Minister's colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, talk about privatisation, even if it was to deny it. If people in English local authorities are worried about privatisation by the back door, the Minister will not be surprised if those in Scottish local authorities are even more worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to have used the Bill in a cavalier manner to interfere in any social work service that appeals to them. Through this probing amendment, I invite the Minister to tell us why that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) on his acrobatics. He cleverly anticipated that I would quote to him his own words. I do not know whether that was a twinge of conscience or a sudden ability to see into the future. However, in our 23rd sitting, the hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister's intervention was nevertheless helpful, because in the amendments we are arguing that community care plans should not be left exclusively with the health authorities or exclusively with the local authorities. As the Griffiths report said repeatedly, it would
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
not work."—(	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee E. 19 February 1990; c. 987.]</p></blockquote>
A little later he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I accept that the Government are not entirely to blame if best practice applies to some areas and not to others and neglect is introduced in some areas but not in others. Local plans should relate to such matters. But local plans cannot have meaning unless Parliament knows, through the Secretary of State for Scotland, what is or is not happening."—	<i>[Official Repor',</i> Standing Committee E, 19 Feb-urary 1990; c. 990.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my point. No one is denying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman agrees with himself. We can agree that he agrees with himself, which is at least something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During discussion of those amendments, the hon. Gentleman made a case for an amendment that argued the necessity for health boards and local authorities to agree before progress could be made. The hon. Gentleman now proposes an amendment that would remove from the Secretary of State powers that would enable him to give direction to some local authorities which might be acting in the way he described at our previous sitting. The hon. Gentleman must make up his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it is difficult for the hon. Gentleman to follow the matter. He will have to make up his mind about whether he wants the Secretary of State to take powers to deliver a strategy for community care. Until now he has argued that the powers are insufficient, but on this amendment he argues that the Secretary of State does not need these powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West made it clear to the Minister that this probing amendment is an attempt to discover precisely on which occasions the powers would be used, as they go way beyond the scope of community care and part IV as it applies to Scotland. He asked what other examples the Minister could give. My hon. Friend made it clear that that was all he wanted to know. If the Minister would stop playing silly debating games and answer the questions and make his defence of the clause, the Committee would make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who has stated that his hon. Friend's amendment is entirely a probing device and that he did not mean what he said. I am happy to accept that. Apparently the purpose of the amendment is to ask why the Secretary of State is to have these powers and to question how he could use them. I suggest that Opposition Members read the speeches of the hon. Member for Monklands, West and see there an argument for the need for the Secretary of State to have powers to achieve his community care plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1161</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is again trying to be too clever. If clause 45 turned simply on giving directions under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and part IV as it relates to Scotland, we would not have tabled a probing amendment because we would have known what it was about. We tried earlier to write similar provisions into the Bill. I accept that the Minister does not want this. The clause relate to all the social work functions of local authorities, not only to community care, which is provided for in this part of the Bill. We want to know how the Secretary of State will use the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman said that. Perhaps the hon. Member for Monklands, West will cast his mind back to the Committee stage of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Bill, during which he argued a powerful case for highly restrictive provisions. I thought that, having seen the Bill, the hon. Gentleman would rise to claim a victory in having changed Government thinking on this matter. The claim would be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart asked me why I believe it necesssary for the Secretary of State to have these powers and why they should be extended beyond community care. We believe it important that the Secretary of State has powers to ensure that, after giving directions to individual authorities about the way in which their services operate, whether in the voluntary sector or to clients as consumers, his policies are delivered. That is not far different from the argument of the hon. Member for Monklands, West during many debates on community care and services for the disabled to which the hon. Gentleman made an interesting and distinguished contribution. The Government believes that the power is necessary to achieve those objectives. No doubt the hon. Gentleman remembers calling for that power. Perhaps I can therefore persuade him to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may well withdraw the amendment but not because of the Minister's attempt at persuasion. Nothing in the 23rd Psalm, or whatever it was that he read—the report of our previous sitting. I believe—was inconsistent with what I said last week. He helped my argument considerably by mentioning the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1968. Far be it from me to claim a victory. If the Government are genuinely keen to advance the principles of the 1968 Act, first, they will introduce and implement the remainder of the Act and, secondly, they will introduce the remainder of the National Health Service (Amendment) Act 1986 which dealt with joint planning and arose from the 1968 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister has time to study this speech, perhaps he will consult the dictionary to confirm that "exclusive" does not mean "joint", that "agreement" does not mean "direction"—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but it is not in order for hon. Mem
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
bers to stand around in Committee. They may stand only if they are moving in or out of the Committee Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —and that "delivery" of good community care is not the same as giving clear and specific directions to social work authorities. There is a great difference between last week's debate about community care and the proposal that the Secretary of State ought to be involved in co-operation on joint planning and a debate on a clause that gives the Secretary of State specific powers of direction. Do the powers relating to social work include the power to privatise? The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health discussed the issue this morning, so I see no reason why the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland cannot do so tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with the hon. Gentleman's first point. Many of the Bill's proposals will be achieved through guidance from the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman has said that the Secretary of State needs to be in a position to ensure that his guidance is acted upon. Clause 45 gives the power. It is a reserve power which provides for the delivery of those objectives and the hon. Gentleman has implied that it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been much less forthcoming than his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health. I regret that. Many people follow our proceedings, especially those in social work departments and in community care in Scotland. I do not know whether the Minister met community care groups when he had responsibility for social work, but, if he did, he will realise the difference between joint planning and community care and directions on social work matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not persuaded the Minister to tell us precisely what the Government have in mind. Perhaps it will happen when we discuss future amendments. To that end, and for no other reason, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 730, in page 44, line 47, leave out from "Act" to "section 2(2)" and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"sections 5A, 12A and 62.".</p></blockquote>
This probing amendment is intended to give the Minister time to reflect on the Government's plans when he thinks about the intention behind the clause. It will again allow him to tell us why the Secretary of State plans to take sweeping powers which he should not need if he adhere to the Government's philosophy on community care which was outlined last week. They are unnecessary, unless, of course he intends to act more widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the National Health Service (Amendment) Act 1986. During its Committee stage, the Opposition argued for joint planning in Scotland a long lines similar to those in England and Wales.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0984">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>
We were supported by the community care group in Scotland, and virtually everyone whom I know in social work. However, the then Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for health, John MacKay, steadfastly resisted our arguments. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) may recall that John MacKay was left on that occasion without a supporter on either side of that Committee. Some of the best speeches were made by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent, who recalled his period as a civil servant at the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At virtually the 12th hour, on the eve of Third Reading, the Prime Minister decided to excert some influence on her Ministers. Mr. MacKay asked to see me and said that it was not possible to put joint planning into the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultatuion and Representation) Bill, but that it could be included in the National Health Service (Amendment) Bill, which was then in the Lords. He said that he was prepared to make a statement to that effect on the Floor of the House if I would accept his arrangement on behalf of my sponsors. I did accept it and he made the statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In due course, to be fair to John MacKay, his arrangement was included in the Bill. However, like many aspects of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act, it has never been introduced. The Government have those powers but do not use them. How can they therefore persuade us that the far greater powers that they seek will be applied to community care? We believe that it is highly unlikely, because they want to direct local authorities on totally different matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek a co-operative framework in which the Secretary of State becomes involved in a co-operative sense, rather than in a dictatorial or a directorial sense. I did not support dictatorial powers of joint planning for the Secretary of State at any stage during the passage of the disabled persons legislation and I do not support them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened to John MacKay's promises? As the Under-Secretary has mentioned the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation), Act, I remind him that there was not once a Division in either House during its passage, because hon. Members and noble Lords accepted John MacKay's promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not using that power, why do they want new powers? Why do they not use existing powers to give guidance, for example, on registration? In Scotland, directors of social work have drawn up guidance about inspection of residential establishments, which is very different in practice from the situation in England. However, everyone knows that those guidelines do not carry any authority at all. Hardly any establishment has been de-registered, because local authorities are not sure whether they would win any appeal. The situation has been accepted generally in Scotland, but not in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are variations in standards, as I mentioned last week. In Scotland, day-care establishments, for instance for mentally handicapped people, have not been given any guidance by the Secretary of State within his existing powers. We shall inevitably ask
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>
probing questions about what the Secretary of State will do now, because he has not been using his existing powers for community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary must be aware that local authorities are working in a vacuum. He rightly said that if local authorities feel that there will be directions but no joint planning of community care, few will emulate best practice. The Scottish Office should be picking up best practice and spreading it around, but it will not get involved because of this sinister clause and what seems to be a request for a blank cheque. Labour Members are not convinced that the Government ought to get that blank cheque. The amendment gives the Under-Secretary the opportunity to convince us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing sinsister abroad. The Government have a policy, spelt out in the White Paper, that is designed to achieve a mixed economy of care. It involves using the voluntary and private sectors. The clause provides for powers that may be necessary to ensure that that policy is carried out. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) should recognise the benefits that will come from the use of the voluntary and the private sectors in adding to resources. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of people in his party who wish to resist that. While the Government wish to proceed by guidance and the publication of good practice, these powers are necessary as reserve powers. There may be other areas, such as the provision of respite care, in which the Government wish to give direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment, which limits the areas in which the Secretary of State may give direction, we could not achieve our objectives. While the hon. Gentleman may have reservations about mixed economy care, I hope that he understands the reason why the powers are necessary and feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no reservations about mixed economy care, but if the Under-Secretary invites his advisers to read what I might loosely describe as the trade press—publications such as 	<i>Social Work Today</i> and 	<i>Community Care</i>—they will see that at conference after conference I have advocated a mixed economy in care. But I am not confident that, when the Under-Secretary refers to a mixed economy, he refers to one that Opposition Members recognise. I am still worried, still not convinced and still perplexed as are people who follow our debates when they listen to the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, reserving the right to return to this matter on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The law in Scotland is different from that in England and Wales in terms of case law. Clause 45 will allow the Secretary of State for Health or his Minister or someone acting for either of them to telephone a director of social work and give him directions.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1165</span>
Clause 44, which we debated at length earlier today, deals with England and Wales, proposed new section 7A(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Directions under this section … shall be given in writing".</p></blockquote>
It does not say that in the Scottish clause. In theory, the Secretary of State or one of his advisers could telephone Fred Edwards, the director of social work for Strathclyde region, and say, "Professor Edwards, we want you to do this, this, and this under the Act. There is nothing you can do about it, because that is what I am telling you to do." If the clause is not about that, I shall be happy to hear the Under-Secretary explain the true intention behind the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in his response to the amendments the Under-Secretary has continued to say that the directions and powers included in the clause will relate to community care and to the provisions of the rest of the bill. If that were so, neither my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) nor I, nor any of my hon. Friends would take great exception to the proposed powers, although we still might have some reservations about them. But the powers will cover every aspect of social work in Scotland. The Secretary of State will have the power to say, "You will do X, Y and Z, if I instruct you to do so." That worries us because there are aspects of social work in which the Secretary of State should not have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the miners' strike, Professor Fred Edwards used his power as director of social work in the Strathclyde region to help miners' families. He got into some trouble over that, but under the powers proposed in the Bill the Secretary of State could phone Professor Edwards to say, "Stop it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He could say, "Stop it, and let the kids starve."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. Similar circumstances might arise in the ambulancemen's strike, and the Secretary of State could take such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strathclyde region, 20 per cent of those who are eligible to pay poll tax have not paid it. The vast majority of them are in desperate need. It is essential that the finance department of Strathclyde region work hand in glove with the social work department to give debt counselling and to help those people in any way that they can. But I am not convinced that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is the father and mother of the poll tax—Tory Members who are worried about the implications of that daft idea might like to note that fact—will want such advice to be given. He might, in giving a direction to social work directors, say, "You will not help those people until the full rigours of the law have been used against them to get the poll tax out of them. When that has been done, when they are deeper in debt, when their goods have been taken away using warrant sales, you can step in and help." Is that the type of direction that the Under-Secretary is considering, because the Bill will empower him to make such directions? If the amendment is not accepted, the Under-Secretary will have the power to do exactly what he wants to social work in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Under-Secretary is prepared to say that he will return to the clause on Report and ensure
	<span class='label label-info column'>1166</span>
that it relates only to community care, the Opposition and many people throughout Scotland will be considerably happier. We are unhappy about giving any Government—including a future Labour Government—those powers. I am sure that, if our roles were reversed after the next election, the Under-Secretary would not want me to have such powers. However, I realise that, as my hon. Friends say, the Under-Secretary will not be re-elected at the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout my career in the House, I have time and time again expressed my anxiety about Bills that give Ministers powers to give directions and to make secondary legislation. That is wrong; laws should always be made, in the House. We should not give Ministers extraordinary powers to direct people's actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause, as I interpret it, gives the Secretary of State powers to direct under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. It will not give him blanket authority, because the 1968 Act does not give anyone blanket authority to do anything. It clearly spells out what the powers mean.

Today, which is my birthday, I received an answer to a written question about matters affecting people living in temporary shelters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Is it in order for us to sing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order, and it is certainly not in order for hon. Members to sing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some hon. Members seem to do nothing but sing, but their songs are very mournful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question was about temporary shelter provided by health authorities, local authorities and voluntary organisations. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) made an interesting point. He made me think that the Secretary of State may, judge that he has to act quickly to help people who are sleeping rough in ghastly weather conditions in, say, Dundee or Glasgow. One way of acting quickly would be to use the powers conferred on him by the clause to give appropriate directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish the hon. Gentleman many happy returns of the day. I had hoped that he would intervene during my speech earlier so that I could wish him a happy birthday. Is he sure that the BBC crew would be available if the Under-Secretary of State used those powers and visited down and outs in Glasgow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the hon. Gentleman was referring to the fact that I carried out research in the presence of television cameras. I did so because I felt that it was important for people to see the circumstances under which some of our citizens were living. I felt also that people should be made aware of what such individuals felt and thought—not what I or the interviewers and television crew thought. If the hon. Gentleman saw the programme, I hope that he will acknowledge that that is what it conveyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I wanted to do was to spoil the hon. Gentleman's birthday. I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
trying to make the point that, whereas he was sincere in his actions, I could not imagine the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland doing the same thing unless a camera crew were present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As today is my birthday, I shall be generous to the hon. Gentleman. During my experience of political life, I have met many people from different parties whom I would not trust to give an honest and objective appraisal of a situation. But such a description does not fit my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who, whatever the hon. Gentleman may feel, is honest, always does things properly and above board, and never leaves anyone in any doubt about his views. He is a splendid chairman to work with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was making a speech about clause 45, but I did not hear him say anything about it. Most of his points were about shelter. The Bill covers the social work fund, but as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, it does not cover housing departments in district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member has not read the report. It does not just concern the directions in terms of the Bill or the 1968 legislation. It relates to any other enactment mentioned in section 2(2) of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968. It includes all previous social work legislation, the whole range of social work functions which the regional councils have now and which the Secretary of State has enormous power to direct on. We are concerned because it gives him power that he would not necessarily use wisely, including previous legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>INQUIRIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 630, in page 46, line 34, after "authority", insert "in relation to audits".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may consider this to be a rather strange amendment and wonder what it is about. It has two purposes. The first refers to the clause providing for inquiries on a wide-ranging variety of different functions carried out by social work departments. Then the explanatory and financial memorandum, which is not part of the Bill but is there for our guidance, says;
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 48 gives power for the Secretary of State to hold an inquiry where he considers it necessary in connection with a local authority's social services activities in relation to audits."</p></blockquote>
That is not wide-ranging and it does not mean the inquiries referred to in the clause itself, it says, quite specifically, "in relation to audits". The Minister is responsible for explaining that difference to the Committee, why it says one thing in the memorandum and something totally different in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that it is a simple probing amendment. We want to know why it is stated not in the notes
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
on clauses but in the explanatory memorandum. It gives the Minister an opportunity to explain what kind of inquiries he expects to set up under the clause and to give us some idea of how he would see these powers being used by him or his successor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has raised an interesting question. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was kind enough to indicate that I was an honest man. As an honest man, I have to say that I have no idea why it says in the Bill that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 48 gives power for the Secretary of State to hold an inquiry where he considers it necessary in connection with a local authority's social services in relation to audits."</p></blockquote>
I am briefed by my excellent helpers in the Department to question why the hon. Gentleman has tabled an amendment adding the words "in relation to audits". The only explanation that I can think of is that perhaps there is a typing mistake in the Bill, and that "audits" should be "adults", but perhaps we can look into that and make the necessary amendments to the explanatory memorandum in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I cannot explain what is written in the explanatory memorandum, I can explain what is written in the clause, which is what matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. gentleman will be aware that there is a current inquiry in respect of a child care policy in Fife region. It has not arisen as a criticism of the local authority, but there is a genuine question about the best approach to certain aspects of child care. At present, our powers are limited to children, and the purpose of the clause is to extend them to adults, as opposed to audits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Cathcart will see the sense of that, and I apologise that, despite the many people working in the Department and my own careful reading of the bill, I had not read the explanatory memorandum sufficiently carefully and picked up the typing error. I will see that it is put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept unreservedly the Minister's explanation. As he quite rightly says, he is an honest man. He has admitted that there was a mistake. I am equally honest and have to say that I did not spot the mistake; it was my adviser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not telling the Minister that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, when we reach the stage that the Scottish Home and Health Department automatically enter the word "audit", instead of "adult", that is the final confirmation, if any were needed, that under the Minister, they know the price of everything but the value of nothing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a good point, but I accept the Minister's apology to the Committee for a misprint. This is the trouble with word processors. If the operator runs the spell check, it will not pick up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0987">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1169</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"adults" for "audits". Either that, or someone's handwriting is illegible.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I am sure that it would interest the Committee to know why his amendment read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 48, page 46, line 34, after 'authority', insert 'in relation to audits',"</p></blockquote>
and not "adults".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the infallibility, if not of the Minister, then of his advisers. When they have written "audit", I expect that that is what they mean. But we have gone far enough down this road: we have heard why the Ministry wants these powers. I have no objection to them having these powers.

I inadvertently delayed proceedings this morning. I did not expect so many interventions and to be on my feet for so long.

In amendment No. 637, we propose to leave out "may" and insert "shall". There are no printing errors and therefore it means what it says. The Minister—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Although our exchanges are erudite and enlightening, they are as nothing compared with the possibility of listening to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Dicks), followed by the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Haynes) talking about the future of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Their exchanges are almost enough to make one vote for self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making the same points as before but in a Scottish context. I shall not repeat all the salient points but I shall mention some, to help the Minister and the hon. Member for Monklands, West, who will want to make further comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Roy Griffiths has been mentioned today. At a recent conference, he described the scheme that he had set out in the White Paper as a four-wheeled vehicle that the Government had turned into a three wheeler by rejecting ring-fencing. We have received no categorical assurances about amounts of cash in real terms and increases that allow for inflation. Far from turning the scheme into a three wheeler, there is a danger of making it a Sinclair C5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The revenue support grant is a means of distribution, but the calculation is not based on individual need or the services that are required to meet that need. That is a fundamental technical failure. Some financial ring-fencing arrangement is therefore required. I mentioned earlier that local authorities faced competing claims—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) must be making a speech in the corridor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt it, because people are laughing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes his point well. A definite air of disrepair has crept into the Committee. We shall all need to be cared for in the community and probably be ring-fenced for the good of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different local authorities face competing claims. Local authorities in my constituency will face overheads in the next financial year, as they have done this year, because of geographic problems. They worry that the social work budget will be cut and that there will not be the necessary implementation. Ring-fencing should be available, if only for a time-limited period, perhaps of two or three years, to get the system up and running and to get the local authorities into a stable budgetary position. They will have committed moneys in their four or five-year financial plans several years in advance and therefore need some assurance.

South of the border, the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales has backed this proposal. Most of us have received literature from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations endorsing it. The Royal College of Nursing has been strongly in favour of it. Local authorities, despite being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1171</span>
dubious at times about earmarked funding and ring-fencing, have said that they consider it essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen a copy of a letter sent to the Ministers of State for Health and for Social Security by Sally Green-gross, the director of Age Concern, which makes a point that is equally relevant to Scotland as it is to England and Wales. Age Concerns expresses its grave disappointment that, having welcomed some aspects of the ringfencing proposed by Sir Roy Griffiths, the Government are not able to designate funds other than those for mentally ill people for the specific purpose of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office Minister with responsibilities for Health has shown himself willing to declare UDI in other parts of the legislation and here is a good opportunity for him to repeat that. When he replies, will he refer to the spirit of amendment No. 504, which was moved by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) in the earlier dsebate on England and Wales? It concerned the need to take account specifically of geographical features and of the overheads that local authorities would face. That has great relevance to Scotland, not least to my part of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) has done a great service to community care in Scotland in introducing the Scottish argument for ringfencing. It is important that the principles we debated this morning should be discussed this evening, albeit briefly, and all the more so because the Scottish Office Minister received some powerful ammunition from the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The English Under-Secretary of State told us that there was ringfencing in England not only for the mentally ill but for the mentally handicapped. I think I noticed the ears of the Under Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), tuning into that remarkable declaration. I am sure that everyone in Scotland who is involved with people with learning difficulties, especially the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped, will be interested to hear that that is the case. Why is it not being embraced in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make myself as clear as I should have done. My answer to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) referred to the Health Service. I was explaining that as far as the Health Service was concerned there was ringfencing for mental handicap expenditure. I did not mean that any part of the revenue support grant that went through social services departments was ringfenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister clarified that. I was about to say that even in England, Mencap would have been immensely surprised. The argument for ringfencing in Scotland is just as strong. Which bodies have told the Minister that they do not support ringfencing? I have not met many who do not, including many who have given us enough briefings to take us to well after midnight, although to spare the Committee I will not attempt to do that. I aim to finish in a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1172</span>
There is enormous support in Scotland for ringfencing, just as there is elsewhere. As we approach a strategy for community care, it is absurd that an Act of Parliament in the 1990s should confine its priorities to the mentally ill. That is an important section of society, but priorities may change. The big issue in the future could be the demographic spread of dementia, and also the physically handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) referred to housing. On Saturday, I had the opportunity to attend the opening of James Dempsey court in Coatbridge. My hon. Friends will recall the sterling service that my predecessor, Jimmy Dempsey, gave to the House and to his constituency. That little community care project was devoted exclusively to housing, and it remains a great tribute to the man. We in Scotland want community care to be adopted in the widest possible manner, so that it embraces housing, leisure and recreation, transport, and so on. But more attention should be paid to arranging bridging funds, to which the Minister referred this morning. He spoke about dowry funding, but that does not exist in Scotland, where no money is made available to people leaving hospital. That is a significant omission. Bridging arrangements are poor in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 5 February, the Minister's Department issued a draft paper headed "In Confidence". I shall not bother the Committee with it, but I shall simply refer to item 4 in the section devoted to finance, in which it is made clear that the grants for the mentally ill are to be top sliced. Does that mean that the money will come from the global financial contribution to community care? If so, it will be a great blow to those who want to see community care in real practice in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal more to say, but shall content myself with expressing the hope that the Minister, while he may not wish to answer all my questions tonight, will recognise that I have tried to put on record the views of the many people anxious about community care in Scotland, to whom the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye referred. I hope that the Minister will write to the hon. Gentleman and me and that the Scottish Office will pay attention to the serious matters that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never want to rush anything, but we have spent a great deal of time today on the arguments for ringfencing.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr.Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0989">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1173</span>
handicap service. About a quarter more is being spent on those services north of the border, to considerable effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point, but there are many more people in residential care in Scotland than there are south of the border. That makes a difference to the calculations. In terms of combined planning on community care by local authorities and the Health Service, Scotland is a long way behind England and Wales. We have a great deal of catching up to do, and want to ensure that there is the money to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman believed care in the community was more expensive than institutional care. Therefore, his argument that we are spending more on local government and the Health Service because more people are in institutional care than community care does not seem to be in line with his party's position. No doubt we can return to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that Scotland has been less enthusiastic about transferring patients, particularly those with mental illnesses, to the community, and that some transitional difficulties encountered south of the border have not been encountered in Scotland. As the hon. Gentleman has said, many people in institutional care suffer from mental illness, and that is all the more reason for having a specific grant system targeted on schemes that will meet the problem. That is why it is impossible to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How could I fail to be helpful to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) after his recent scribblings in 	<i>The Scotsman!</i> He asked me to look at the geographical considerations. We consulted about the mental illness grant provisions and knowing how assiduously the hon. Gentleman represents his constituents, I am sure that he will see that representations reflect geographical considerations. I see no reason why they should not be takenn into account. Indeed, there are positive attractions in using a scheme that enables resources to be targeted to meet the problems encountered in remote areas, such as the hon. Gentleman's constituency. For those reasons, I am reluctant to accept the propsal in amendment No. 795. It would restrict our ability to target resources in the way that the hon. Gentleman would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West will be disappointed that I have not gone round the course completely in spelling out the arguments on ringfencing in Scotland, but I hope that he will withdraw the amendment on the basis that we may be able to return to the issue later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was as unconvincing at nearly 10 pm as he was at 9 pm.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have another few clauses to debate and we are coming back at 10.15 pm, I should like to say something now about mentally handicapped people that is not dealt with in the clause. Many people in institutions should never have been put there at all. They are in massive Victorian buildings in Scotland, such as the Royal hospital and Lennox Castle hospital, and there is great pressure for them to go back into the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we finished, I was saying that it is important to have ringfencing—a specific grant—for those suffering from mental illness. But that is only part of the problem, especially if we are serious about taking out of hospital or large institutions in Scotland the mentally handicapped as opposed to those who are mentally ill. Problems have arisen in large, Victorian hospitals such as Lennox Castle and the royal hospital at Larbert, both of which are outdated buildings. Patients there suffer from mental handicap. Nowadays, such people would never be sent there; they would be cared for in the community. Some patients have been there for up to 30 years. They were put there by parents who did not know how to deal with them. There were no support services then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those patients should be taken from such institutions and put into community care, but that is possible only if large sums of money are available over a long period. Mentally handicapped people must have the help and support that they require, but the Government give no commitment in the Bill that such people will be looked after. In some ways, mentally handicapped people are at greater risk than those who are mentally ill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not, because I receive no financial reward. Adtec Inititatives is an organisation for training the mentally handicapped particularly in the skills of new technologies such as computers. It works well, but it is desperately short of money and is always looking for grants. Regional councils often say that they have no money and that Adtec must apply to the European Social Fund. There are enormous problems in ensuring that the mentally handicapped get the help that they require and Adtec is exactly the type of organisation that will ensure that mentally handicapped people get the training and support that they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in the least surprised that the hon. Gentleman is involved in such activities, nor am I surprised that he does it without remuneration. Company directors are not always remunerated. What he does is not uncommon; I am sure that many other members of the Committee also serve on bodies without remuneration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that. My comment about remuneration was in response to the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) who asked whether the work was included in the Register of Members' Interests, and I said that it was not because I receive no remuneration for it. I am also on the board of the Glasgow International Jazz Festival, for which I also receive no remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am an active member of the Adtec Initiative and Cojac—the umbrella organisation for Adtec—in Castle Milk and the Glasgow special housing group. They are essential to bringing mentally handicapped people back into society and ensuring that they can not only live in the community but play an active role in it and do things that they feel are worthwhile. The clause contains nothing about ringfencing money for such organisations and people. They need money; they are always desperately short of it. We cannot have mentally handicapped people leaving hospitals without our ensuring that care is provided for them in the community and that the local authorities responsible for looking after them know that the money is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell Conservative Members from England and Wales that the Conservative Government in Scotland are prepared to allow local authorities to raise their own money through the poll tax without capping it. It is wrong that they should have to use the poll tax to raise that money, but at least they are allowed to get on with it in accordance with the principle of the poll tax and accountability. Presumably, the Government hope that the Scottish electorate will pay them back if they use the system wrongly. Local authorities should not be forced to raise poll taxes to do such work; they should know that the money is available from central
	<span class='label label-info column'>1176</span>
Government specifically for the purposes set out in the Bill. It is no use including it as part of revenue support grant because, although most local authorities would try desperately not to cut this service, it might be cut if local authorities were forced to make cuts because of the pressures of cuts in revenue support grant. The Minister should consider widening the clause to ensure that mentally handicapped people are included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that we have a little more time to consider these matters, although I see the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) pointing to the clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. We have spent five and a half hours talking about how these provisions relate to England and Wales. The hon. Member for Pembroke played a full part in the debate and intervened several times.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a new issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland is a new issue and a very important one. With your approval, Dame Janet, I shall quote the views of people in Scotland who deal with these matters day after day and whose opinions are important. To be fair, the Minister has given great thought to our discussions and he will want to consider their views. Many people in Scotland are struggling with problems. They accept that money for the mentally ill should be ringfenced. If community care is to be meaningful, it must embrace everybody, including the mentally handicapped. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) argued that case, and I agree with him. The Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped, the views of those Helensburgh and District branch I have already mentioned, also supports it. In a letter, the society supports ring-fencing and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over three years ago this branch initiated discussion with Argyll and Clyde Health Board, Social Work Department (Dumbarton Division), Dumbarton District Council (Housing) and SSMH Homes Ltd in order to provide such a project."</p></blockquote>
That refers to a specific project for the mentally handicapped in Helensburgh. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dumbarton District council has always been most supportive and are ready to adapt housing for the project as soon as Social Work and the Health Board agree to revenue funding. Both parties have agreed in principle 	<i>in writing</i> but the Health Board has now informed us that there is no money at present and unlikely to be any in the next financial year …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Those of us who have attended the joint meetings over the last three years naturally feel very frustrated by this attitude but the most important aspect is the families who are waiting"</p></blockquote>
Those are the families of mentally handicapped people—carers—and they are worried abaout their children both now and after they themselves are dead. It is an important issue. The letter continues:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1177</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Obviously their hopes and expectations have been raised by these empty promises"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the failure to get funding for a joint project and the fact that ringfencing would apply to the mentally ill, not the mentally handicapped. The letter describes two cases where people's hopes were dashed. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Dame Janet, I am not easily provoked, but I shall not continue if the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) continues to treat the matter so flippantly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hour is late and tolerance has become stretched. I hope that courtesy will prevail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. The letter described two cases about which I know most hon. Members would like to hear. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"LINDA PARKES is in her thirties and has multiple handicaps. Her parents have devoted themselves to her care, but this devotion is not without price. Mrs. Parkes was hospitalised three times in the last year and now Mr. Parkes too is convalescing after a hospital stay. Their health is definitely deteriorating because of the strain of looking after Linda. It is difficult to see how they can continue. They hoped that Linda would be selected for a place in Key Housing-Milngavie. She was one of thirty-five applicants for five places, but even Linda's desperate plight was not bad enough and she did not get a place. The Parkes family are putting all their hopes on the Helensburgh project".</p></blockquote>
The letter referred to Robert Cahill, who is aged 20:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He too has multiple handicaps. He lives with his parents—his father has M.S.—but Mr. and Mrs. Cahill work tirelessly for their son. They would dearly like to see him settled in a house in Helensburgh where they could visit him and enjoy his company without the strain of his physical care.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Both families were happy for me to use their stories and wish you every sucess in your efforts for the Roberts and Lindas of this land."</p></blockquote>
Members of the Committee know that people try to cope in difficult circumstances. That letter underlines the difficulty of insisting that ringfencing should apply only to those who are mentally ill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to the project, the Argyll and Clyde health board said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As well as the Health Board indicating that there were currently no funds for joint funding projects, it was also indicated that it was not currently allowing any monies for any health service developments due to the overall financial position.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A number of families in the Helensburgh/Dumbarton area had had their expectations raised in relation to the provision of local residential facility as a result of the exercise undertaken to assess the level of need.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Health Board representatives expressed concern for the future, regarding the affordability nationally of small scale community projects and that this was a more expensive method of providing a service, compared with the current situation."</p></blockquote>
There were two groups of people—one was worried about the mentally ill and the other expressed its anxieties about the mentally handicapped. Both groups had the same objective, but it was not acheived in Scotland because of the absence of ringfencing and joint planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties in Lothian. Some, if not all, hon. Members have received a letter from the Scottish Association for Mental Health about a project developed by a multi-disciplinary group. It states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>1178</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the past five years a multi-disciplinary group has been developing a series of proposals to offer community based services to 30 people who currently reside in the Thomas Clouston Clinic attached to the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. These proposals are now threatened by the financial crisis affecting Lothian Health Board which has raised serious concern about whether resources will be available to fund both the capital and revenue aspects of this scheme. Without start-up monies the project simply will not be able to go ahead and the 30 people concerned will be unable to lave institutional care."</p></blockquote>
The group is struggling to get as many people out of institutional care as it can—that is everyone's objective—yet it is faced with difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a growing consensus in Scotland that the principles outlined in the White Paper 'Caring for People', will be unworkable in practice without bridging finance, dowry payments or resource transfer arrangements which might facilitate the transfer from institutional to community-based care. Scotland faces a major task in trying to develop a community-based mental health service from a point where, on all the major service indicators, we lag far behind the rest of the UK."</p></blockquote>
I hope that what I have said and the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart will convince the Minister that there is a serious problem in Scotland. I am extremely grateful to the Minister, because he has listened carefully to the views expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. No Member of Parliament representing a Scottish constituency has taken more interest in these matters. I cannot comment directly on the example of Helensburgh, but the health boards have made progress in devloping schemes for the mentally handicapped in the community, and we encourage that. The hon. Gentleman should not read too much into the dowry scheme that operates in England, as it has no statutory backing. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State described it as a type of ringfencing, but its funding by the health boards is voluntary and is part of the joint agreement with local authorities. We want to encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resources for local authorities and health boards have increased substantially in real terms. More progress could and should be made with the mentally handicapped, but the provision of day and residential places in the community has grown more quickly than provision for the mentally ill. The number of mentally ill people in residential institutional care in Scotland is proportionately higher than the number of mentally handicapped in similar care. It is also higher than the comparable figure in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, a specific grant scheme targeted to that group makes good sense and meets our purpose. I think that the Committee is divided by differences of philosophy and approach. The Government regard the scheme as a way of encouraging faster progress on behalf of the mentally ill. It is not a scheme for taking away from the local authorities and the health boards the responsibility to use the available resources and to give priority to groups such as the mentally handicapped and people suffering from mental illness. I hope that that explanation will satisfy the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received many representations asking for a specific grant scheme to cover all community care services. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr.

Clarke) is right to say that he is not alone in wanting that. It is curious, however, that we should hear an argument for the extension of specific grant schemes from a distinguished former president of COSLA. Such schemes will limit local authorities' opportunities to decide their expenditure priorities. A balance must be struck, and I believe that it is right to give priority to expenditure on mental illness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the general tenor of his remarks. He will know that, after 10 years, COLSA and the Scottish local authorities are unfortunately beginning to get used to Government interference. That may have influenced them. He will also know that COSLA and its social work committee have warmly embraced the principle of ringfencing for community care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indeed aware of COSLA's preference. Its argument is that specific grants reduce the ability of local authorities to provide according to local circumstances. Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman by undertaking to examine the matter of dowry funding in Scotland again in the light of our experience of the new arrangements. I shall not close the door on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is aware of the Government's position. My hon. Friends would not thank me for rehearsing it again this evening—indeed, I can sense that in a gesture from my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight).
