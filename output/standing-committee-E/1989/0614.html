<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being out of breath. I was in the same radio studio as the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). Unfortunately, the equipment packed up and we had to move to another studio, which caused some delay.<br><br>
I move from discussing the benefits of joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system to discussing the tax position of banks—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. As he knows, I have a great interest in the clause. His arrival, even at the 59th minute of the 11th hour is extremely welcome. Does he agree with me that the EMS and especially the ERM are extremely important although we do not share the same views? My views are more sound that his—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the exchange rate mechanism. It does not appear to be relevant to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it is not, but I wanted to say ߞ</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is all right then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his important intervention. Strongly though I may disagree with his views on the matter, I accept what you say, Mr. Cormack, that it has nothing whatever to do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
with the contents of clause 66, the title of which is "Debts of overseas governments etc."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith (Isligton, South and Finsbury)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. The exchange rate mechanism has a tangential relevance to the clause. Were sterling to enter the exchange rate mechanism, it might enable the Government, over a period of months, to contemplate reductions in interest rates. That would have a run-on impact on the debt held by many sovereign countries, which is covered by the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that that is so. That would be welcome to borrowers, wherever they are.<br><br>
The last time that the Government thought it appropriate to legislate for the tax regime affecting banks was in the Finance Act 1981 when it was alleged that the banks were making excessive profits because interest rates were very high. The Government introduced a windfull tax on profits. Few Ministers have resigned over matters of principle in the past 11 years. However, the Chief Whip, my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex (Mr. Renton) resigned as parliamentary private secretary to my right hon. Friend the Member for Shropshire, North (Mr. Biffen) who was Secretary of State for Trade. The resignation letter, published in The Times on 20 May 1981, included the following sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"this tax penalises success and that is a very unhappy example for a … Government to set".</p></blockquote>
The tax in clause 66 penalises failure. The banks which lent money to third-world countries have failed in a big way and have very bad or prospective bad debts on their books. Let us examine what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said on 20 March when he explained why the Chancellor of the Exchequer said on 20 March when he explained why the Government considered it right to introduce the clause. He said that the main object was to clarify the tax regime for banks. I accept the need to do that. He said that two problems needed to be tackled. The first was that banks have very substantially increased their provisions for those bad debts—I think that he had last year especially in mind—and he pointed to the adverse impact of that on public finances. He said that the tax costs of the 1989 increases alone approached £1 billion. That shows just how large some of those write-offs were for the banks.<br><br>
The second problem was lack of clarity and, particularly with sovereign Government debts, estimating the irrecoverability of debts. It is always difficult when a debt has not been paid but has not gone bad because the business has not gone bust. What estimate is made of the likelihood of the debt being repaid? Accountants make that subjective test every day of the week. When they have made that assessment, the taxpayer must discuss whether that is reasonable for the Inland Revenue. That is how it works. There is no formula for bad debts in the private sector. I believe that if the debt is completely bad, it is written off and there is full tax recovery. If a debt is not completely bad but a provision is made for it, an estimate is made and there is discussion with the Inland Revenue about whether that estimate is reasonable. From my experience, generally
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0133">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
speaking, the Inland Revenue is prepared to accept the figure in the accounts. I shall comment more on that in a moment.<br><br>
The clause proposes several changes. The first—to which amendments Nos. 60, 61 and 63 relate—is what might be called the ratchet effect. Perhaps I may explain how that works. I worked out some examples because that sometimes helps in such complicated matters. Let us suppose that a bank has a debt of £100 and, up until now, has provided £50, thus showing £50 as the asset in the balance sheet. Suppose that this year it decides to provide a further £20 to write off £20, which means it will have written off 70 per cent of the debt. Under these proposals, it will not be able to have that £20 for tax relief; it will get only 5 per cent of the original debt—in other words, £5. Therefore, if it writes off £20 next year, it will get only £5 and £5 in the following year, £5 in year three and £5 in year four. It will take four years to obtain the tax relief because that is how it is restricted.<br><br>
That is also true of an actual loss, to which one of the other amendments relates. If the actual loss is more than the provision and the debt is £100 and £50 has been provided to date; if the debt is sold on the secondary market for £30, the actual loss is £20. But the bank will not be allowed to have that £20 for tax relief; it will have only £5.<br><br>
What happens if the opposite applies? Let us suppose that the bank has a debt of £100 and, up until 1990, has provided £50 but then decides that the chances of recovering the money have improved. It might be argued that that is unlikely. But if that is so and it decides to reduce the provision by £20, the whole of that relief that was previously granted is clawed back in one go. There is no matching here. If the provision is increased, one can get only 5 per cent. If the provision is clawed back, the whole lot is lost in one go.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendments is to make the ratchet effect work both ways so that it works in favour of the Inland Revenue and, in the unlikely event that the provision is reduced, in favour of the taxpayer. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that this is an equitable principle on which to base these provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) set out the technical case extremely well. I will try to set the matter in its historical perspective.<br><br>
There is widespread belief that banks have brought these problems on themselves because they engaged in thoroughly irresponsible lending so had it coming to them, and that it is wrong to allow them to offset these losses against tax, thereby denuding the Treasury of cash to spend on worthwhile projects.<br><br>
Any expense or write-off against taxation reduces Treasury income. There is nothing unusual in that. Every business which has a bad debt can write it off, and the taxpayer picks up the bill for the bad judgment of the company in question, which is why Conservatives believe in successful companies. Therein lies one of the banking fraternity's principal objections to the Government's proposed change.<br><br>
The prayer books say, "Hear also what St Paul sayeth." It is an apt saying. Many have come to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
support of the banks' case against what they see as the injustice of clause 66. I could cite the the words of the Institute of Directors where I had dinner on Tuesday but as that hospitality is now someway down the line I will cite the Institute of Taxation, which has an equally valid view. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Although limited in scope, clause 66 represents a regrettable departure from the principle that an actual trade loss should he relieved when suffered. While the circumstances of sovereign debt are such as to make rules for dealing with provisions appropriate, where the taxpayer has actually realised the loss, relief should be available immediately and not continue to be spread forward."</p></blockquote>
Similar views have been expressed by organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Law Society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Diane Abbott <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to deny that the banks got it wrong so now have it coming to them. Anyone who knows anything about the circumstances in which these debts were doled out in the 1970s knows that the banks got it wrong and think that they should bear the burden of their misjudgment.<br><br>
The Treasury Select Committee took evidence from Sir Jeremy Morse, the chairman of Lloyds Bank, and from Sir Kit McMahon, the chairman of the Midland Bank, some of the heaviest lenders to these debtors in the 1970s and 1980s. Sir Kit MacMahon said about their lending that it was an aberration and it proved disastrous.<br><br>
The banks know that they got it wrong. The hon. Gentleman is dishonest in saying that they do not have it coming, they do, and they should be made to take their medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that the hon. Lady was a banker in the early 1970s or knew anything then about these issues; she certainly knows nothing about them now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I gave way to the hon. Lady who made an assertion. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Lady will be patient, I will answer her.<br><br>
I was about to deal precisely with the hon. Lady's point. If she listens she will hear extensive references to the Select Committee report that she prayed in aid.<br><br>
I declare an interest. In the 1970s, I was a lending banker and, before coming to the House, I was syndication manager of Standard Chartered Bank which, along with many other banks, engaged in sovereign lending. That is why I prefaced my remarks by saying that I wanted to set this matter in an historical perspective. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield dealt with the technical points.<br><br>
I stand by my statement that banks have been unduly criticised. In direct answer to the hon. Lady, I was around at the time and aware of what was going on. That is why I have spoken in this debate.<br><br>
The 1973–74 oil crisis is the starting point for the position in which we find ourselves today. The banks acted as intermediaries recycling the sudden new-found wealth of oil-rich countries to those countries who were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
dependent upon oil imports to sustain their fragile but growing economies. Those sudden surpluses had absolutely nowhere to go. Countries like Saudi Arabia had no projects in which to invest the funds. The only repository for those funds was in the international banking system.<br><br>
It is to the enormous credit of the international banking system that it coped with those dramatic increases in revenues from the oil-rich countries to help out those countries which were oil-poor.<br><br>
The Select Committee report of March 1987 said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was the commercial banks which assumed responsibility for recycling OPEC surpluses into the mainstream of the world financial system. The manner in which this was achieved was usually by the syndicated loan. Groups of banks would club together to loan funds on deposit."</p></blockquote>
I regard the word "loan" as wrong because there is no verb to loan. it means to lend funds.— <i>(Interruption.)</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have a running commentary from a sedentary position. That is not on. The Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) must contain herself and make a speech later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to explain to the hon. Lady what happened.<br><br>
The banks found themselves under enormous pressure to relieve the burden of many of the Third world countries. The consequence was that no longer were project loans being entertained so much as balance of payments funding simply to meet the sudden surge in import bills that those countries faced a they were unable to adjust to the sudden change in world trading circumstances. That is how those balance of payments loans came about.<br><br>
I shall not say that the banks were wholly blameless—I can see that the hon. Lady has doubts. My point is that very few people—hardly the banks themselves—have sought to emphasise the incredibly important, constructive and valuable role which banks played.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Is it not true that they made some disastrous decisions during that period? For instance, the loan to the Marcos Government of £2.1 billion to build a nuclear power station at the foot of a volcano in the fire rim of the Pacific Basin in the earthquake zone. Thank goodness Cory Aquino was elected and it was never commissioned. That is the sort of responsible lending that went on in the 1970s.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I like to think that such examples prove that bankers are human like everyone else. The definition of a banker—"He will lend you his umbrella, except when it is raining"—is not entirely fair.<br><br>
The banks have been encouraged, not only by Governments but by people and organisations such as the Third-world lobby, which I have no doubt the hon. Lady supports, who believed it was the banks' duty to go to the aid of those people because they had so much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
money. It probably said, "You are awash with money and it is your duty to help out these poor countries who through no fault of their own are trying to adjust from an agrarian economy to a semi-industrial economy. They have been caught in the fix of the 1974-74 oil crisis. It is the job of you rich banks to recycle your funds, do your Christian duty, dish out the dough and save them." With the benefit of hindsight, all that is now forgotten.<br><br>
There was also enormous pressure from banks' domestic customers, major construction companies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Banks around the world were under pressure from their major customers engaged in contracting and in selling capital goods and projects. The banks were encouraged to lend to those countries in support of their customers' exports.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend, I too was involved in making loans in the long-distant past. Does my hon. Friend also recall that one of the pressures to lend money for balance-of-payments loans was to prevent the countries who otherwise could not afford to purchase the oil from crashing into major recession. One purpose of such loans was to ensure that those countries could stagger their reaction to the oil price rises by borrowing. It was an essential form of leanding. Does my hon. Friend also agree that most of that lending was instigated not by the banks but by the borrowers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Lady that I was involved in making those loans. Few unwilling borrowers signed on the dotted line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is 100 per cent right. I am most grateful to him.<br><br>
What I have to say about the responsibility of the banks is essential to the clause 66. The banks are the guilty parties. The hon. Lady has usefully spelt out the banks' criminality and imprudence. But what about Governments? I said that Governments were responsible for encouraging the banks to undertake such lending. What about the Export Credits Guarantee Department, part of the Department of Trade and Industry and the official arm of Her Majesty's Government in the promotion of exports? That department has not distinguished itself with prudence. So far, it has written off £3,263 million against bad debts. If it had to obey Bank of England guidelines, it would have set off a further £3,000 million, making a total of over £6,000 million. That money has effectively been lost to the Treasury, because ECGD, as an agent of Her Majesty's Government, has engaged in some imprudent lending to third-world countries and others. I do not complain about it, I merely point out the export credit agency's record. That £6,000 million can be compared with the write off by the banks—to the detriment of the Treasury. I apologise if I am making life a little difficult for my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, but the private sector has cost the Treasury a modest £1,000 million for its alleged imprudence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend referred to the Export Credits Guarantee Department.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
Is he aware that that department had its accounts qualified last year, because its provisions for bad and doubtful debts failed to comply with Bank of England guidelines? It was rapped over the knuckles by the National Audit Office. The crucial difference is that the private sector has tax relief on 40 per cent of the debt, whereas the taxpayer has to cover the entire burden of debts incurred by the ECGD.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend reinforces the point. The banks have been positively encouraged by the supervisory authorities—in the case of the United Kingdom by the Bank of England—to write down that debt. The report of the Select Committee on Treasury and Civil Service, states at paragraph 26 that—
<br><blockquote><p>"The big UK banks in July and August 1989 increased provisioning to between 46 per cent and 50.4 per cent; and more recently Nat West further increased its provisioning to 75 per cent. Barclays to 70 per cent and Lloyds to 83 per cent. The big Swiss banks and some German banks now provision at 70 per cent or even more."</p></blockquote>
Examples are given of other countries.<br><br>
If the clause is not amended, there is a danger that there could be a conflict between the Bank of England's supervisory role in encouraging the banks to write down their debt, to restructure their balance sheets and to be prudent and responsible in the presentation of their accounts and the refusal of the Treasury to allow the appropriate tax treatment.<br><br>
May I remind my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that the Select Committee report on international debt strategy, at paragraph 112, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The banks, having realised their losses, could not reasonably be denied relief on those losses."</p></blockquote>
I concede that one should not see Select Committee reports as tablets of stone brought down from the mountains, but this is a comprehensive report and bears further examination. The banks cannot provide for a written-off debt. The Treasury is arguing, I understand, that some lenders are servicing interest payments now, and that therefore provision should not be made against those debts. I submit that the case for provisioning is not invalidated, because in Brazil, for example, under the rescheduling arrangements, once the debt is repaid by a borrower the funds go back into the accounts of the Central Bank of Brazil and have to be re-lent to another Brazilian borrower. Although the debt is being serviced and interest is paid on it, no capital repayment is being made, and there is no visible future date on which the loans will be repaid.<br><br>
In answer again to the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott), may I say that much of the rescheduling that has taken place has been on the never-never basis and at the behest of international bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank. I must emphasise that the banks are not trying to circumvent their tax liability in this way.<br><br>
Perhaps in replying my hon. Friend will deal with the difference in the matrices: the existing matrix will be drawn up by the Bank of England by which provisions are determined, and another by the Inland Revenue. I do not think that the banks object to the idea of the Inland Revenue drawing up a matrix. At present each has to argue its case individually before the Revenue.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
and the suggestion of a formula by which every bank will be judged on a common basis is acceptable. However, we need to know more about the difference between the two matrices.<br><br>
The banks are in a sense being treated as whipping-boys. We were told at an earlier sitting that clause 53 is designed to facilitate the tax benefit of abandonment costs in the oil industry, but the banks, by contrast, have been handicapped in restructuring their balance sheets to cope with this problem of third-world debt. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has already spoken of the windfall profits tax that was imposed in the early 1980s. The banks' shareholders have not been without loss, but they have taken it on the chin. The Select Committee report suggested that now that the bank collapse has been avoided it is in the interests of all parties that the problem should be resolved. The banks are in better shape and countries with worth-while developments can again look for help.<br><br>
That argues the case not for accepting this clause unamended, but for allowing the banks to write off those losses that have been incurred. If the losses are not losses, and the money flows back to the banks, the tax will go to the Treasury and the taxpayer will be paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) was right—to a certain extent—when he said that the clause singles out the banks for special treatment. The clause could be described as the fizzing with fury clause. When the banks failed to do No. 10's bidding on student loans, they were promised that retribution would come. The £200 million gain for the Exchequer that the clause represents may be assumed to be that retribution.<br><br>
However, that does not mean that the Government are doing the wrong thing. They are not. Labour Members believe that the clause represents a small step in the right direction. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has tabled several amendments to the clause, most of which could best be described as an endeavour to be kinder than the Government to the banks. Opposition Members have tabled other amendments which may best be described as an attempt to be kinder than the Government to the third world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The object of my amendments is to ensure that the banks are treated on the same basis as any other commercial organisation and that their bad debts are treated in the same way. I am not interested in the merits of bank lending, and so on. I am interested in a consistent tax system which treats corporate taxpayers on an equal basis. Why does the hon. Member believe that bad debts incurred by banks should be treated differently from other commercial bad debts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For two reasons. First, they have consistently been treated differently in recent years because of the Bank of England matrix. At present, a bad debt by a commercial company in the normal course of events is accepted by the Inland Revenue as a genuine bad debt, but it has consitently taken the view in recent years that sovereign bad debts are in a different category and the Bank of England matrix identifies that difference.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
Secondly, sovereign debt has a major impact on the health and welfare of thousands, if not millions, of people in the third world. The Opposition wish to provide genuine assistance to the third world and simply treating the banks commerical sovereign debt in the same way as ordinary commercial debt in our domestic tax system is not necessarily the right way of doing so.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I wish to take up two points that were made by the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood. First, he seemed to suggest in his history of the lending that took place, especially in the 1970s, in the aftermath of the accretion of wealth by the oil producing countries, that banks were lending to developing countries out of the kindness of their hearts. He ignored the substantial profits that many of those loans made for the banks. For example, in 1973, Brazil's external debts stood at 9 billion dollars. Between 1973 and 1985 Brazil paid 145 billion dollars in debt sevice, while 121 billion dollars entered the country in new loans. The Brazilian economy suffered a net outflow of 24 billion dollars but its total debt simultaneously rose to 95 billion dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman understand that one of the reasons why that debt increased was because the banks were prepared to put in new money to finance projects such as the rebuilding of the state oil company, Petrobras. At that time, everybody's endeavour, including that of the United Kingdom, was to find oil wherever possible. Money was invested in Petrobras in Brazil and Pemex in Mexico to meet the immediate objective of trying to reduce the oil bill. The money was not offered simply to make profits for the bank, but for a good economic purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot counter the basic point that loans made by banks at that time, and subsequently, were not made simply out of the goodness of people's hearts. There have been returns for the banks. For example, CitiBank had a 5 per cent of its total capital in Brazil, but raised 20 per cent of its overall profits from loans to Brazil. Therefore, it was an extremely profitable exercise for CitiBank at the time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) mistakenly referred to a potential conflict between the Bank of England encouraging provision against bad debts and, at the same time, the Treasury not allowing relief. The Bank of England matrix, coupled with the clause that we are discussing means that the recommended percentage provision will be closely linked with the amount of tax relief that will be available. The Government purpose that those two things should be linked and progressively increased over a period of years. Far from establishing a conflict, the Government are establishing a link.<br><br>
Our criticism of the clause and the amendments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is that they do little, if anything, to assist debt reduction in the third world. It is one thing to assist the commercial banks to gain tax relief for making provision against bad debts in their own accounts, but another to secure debt relief for the struggling economies and peoples of the Third world.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
The Government's proposal makes a minor gesture in that direction and we shall discuss that in detail later, but the basic thrust of the clause is to reap an advantage for the Exchequer. It will make life a little less advantageous for the banks, but will not secure the relief of debt. That is our greatest criticism of what the Government are doing in clause 66 and the hon. Gentleman's amendments.<br><br>
I may be wrong, but I think that amendment No. 63 may be slightly technically defective. It refers to a specified percentage but does not define what that means. The Minister may want to take up that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before making my remarks, I declare an interest as I am still an adviser to a bank. Although I do not believe that that bank will benefit greatly from the proposed changes as it has rid itself of most of its debt, nevertheless it was involved in such lending and as 1 said to my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) earlier, I was involved in a certain amount of its lending. That is not to say that I wish to pretend that the banks were blameless. Undoubtedly, considerable errors were made by me, among others, about the creditworthiness of the countries to which we were lending money. However, there is a tendency to forget that the countries borrowing it were pretending that they would repay it at some time. So, although the blame does not lie exclusively with the borrowing countries, equally, it does not lie exclusively with the banks.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said that some banks made a lot of money from lending to third world countries and indeed they did. It would be extemely worrying if they had not, because they offered high risk lending and everybody recognised that lending to Brazil was higher in risk than lending to, say, France or Sweden which were also big borrowers at the time. Consequently, the rewards to the banks for that type of lending was that much greater. Although we might shed a few tears over the balance sheets of banks which discovered that those risks were going to crystallise and lose them money, they had lent it knowing perfectly well that there were risks, so they should take the consequences.<br><br>
We need to have a sense of balance when considering what happened. The banks lent money understanding what they were doing; they got it wrong and should take the losses that have been incurred.<br><br>
My worry about the clause was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) who drew an analogy between this matter and the windfall tax on bank profits. Perhaps the Treasury will note the profits which the banks are making at present and desire to try to limit the amount which they will be able to retain. That may be reasonable because, at times of high interest rates banks inevitably make gains on their capital which are shown in higher profits. That has nothing to do with the skill of the bankers or the quality of the banks but purely a matter of the size of the capital and the nature of the structure of the balance sheets of banks. However, there is a problem of timing and I urge my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to remember that banks are influenced by recessions. They may make profits when interest rates are high, but towards the end of a recession, when there are bad debts and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
interest rates start to drop, banks profits also tend to drop very dramatically.<br><br>
It may appear that banks are doing very well when everyone else is doing very badly, but the balance sheets of banks look increasingly shaky when everyone starts to come up after having hit bottom. British banks may soon be in that position, so before my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary takes too much money from the banks, I urge him to reflect that he may need to apply a gentler touch to bank balance sheets in future.<br><br>
My major worry about this part of the clause has been mentioned and it relates to its effect on bank provisions. Restricting the tax write off that banks can take on debts will undoubtedly decrease the willingness of some to take provisions. Banks are most reluctant to take them at the best of times, partly because bankers have to recognise when they have made a mistake in making bad loans, and partly because it tends to knock their capital ratios and make their banks look less attractive to other bankers. However, for the strength of the banking system, it is important for the banks to make a significant and realistic provision ratio against their loans, especially if they are of a type which, if recoverable at all, can only be recovered over a long period.<br><br>
Again, I ask my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, when drawing up the schedules, to ensure that the Bank of England matrix for making provisions and the amount that the Treasury allows banks to write off mesh together in a prudential way. That would make certain that banks end with the right level of provisions. From my knowledge of the way such matters are negotiated with the bank of England, I suspect that it will have to take a much firmer line in the implementation of its matrix and when considering the size of the provisions the banks need to make. That can be done only on a bank-by-bank basis. I hope that the Treasury will have close discussions with the Bank of England to ensure that the clause will not allow banks to under provide for bad loans.<br><br>
However, many banks will welcome the clause because it will provide certainty in the difficult negotiations with the Inland Revenue about which loans are recoverable. That certainty is important and I encourage the Inland Revenue to consider how it could extend the certainty beyond the sovereign debt of those countries to ensure that banks know clearly what provisions they can make against their balance sheets and can claim against tax.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been moved almost to tears by the profound humanitarianism of Conservative Members about the plight of the banks. We wish only that they would show as much sympathy to the millions of people suffering under the crippling weight of debt repayment as they show to a handful of continuingly prosperous bankers.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) questioned why the banks alone should take a hit and wondered about official sector debt. I agree that it is wrong that people consider debt reduction in the commercial sector only, and not in the official sector. The serious debt repayment problem of the sub-Saharan
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
countries cannot be met unless the official sector debt is considered.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was a banker in the 1970s and he told the Committee that bankers did nothing wrong. Sir Kit McMahon, the chairman of Midland bank said about the 1970s:
<br><blockquote><p>"it was a very abnormal and. as it happens, wrong situation that pertained in the 1970s when banks lent these countries large sums. Normally developing countries did not get all the inflows they needed from balance of payments finance by banks. It was an aberration and it has proved very disastrous."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a second. If I had to choose between the judgments of the hon. Gentleman and the chairman of Midland bank, I know which I should choose. Of course it was wrong. Miscalculations were made and it was not some great humanitarian operation, as Conservative Members would have us believe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sir Kit McMahon was a central banker in the 1970s and senior in the Bank of England. His crossing of the Rubicon to join Midland bank was fairly recent when he came in to settle the bank's problems with Third-world debt. Consequently, his perspective about what went on in the 1970s is different from that of people who were actually practitioners in the market place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some might argue that having had to come in as chairman of Midland bank and clear up the mess left by Conservative Members, Sir Kit McMahon might be just a touch more impartial on the matter.<br><br>
I want to respond to the extraordinary depiction of bankers as a pinstriped version of the Mothers League, spreading sunlight and happiness throughout the third world. Conservative Members claim that banks lent the money only because they were under enormous pressure and wanted simply to do good. Perhaps they have been struck by amnesia about what really happened in the 1970s when bankers went out into the Third world and aggressively marketed those loans. Sometimes the loans went to corrupt elites, but they were marketed. When Conservative Members try to move people to tears about the plight of the banks and the money that they have lost, let me remind them that the banks have made money from those loans three times over. They managed the money from the OPEC countries and mad profits from that. They made money lending money.<br><br>
Conservative Members have not mentioned that much of the money never reached the borders of the countries involved: 30 per cent of loans made to Brazil in the 1970s did not get into Brazil, but exited as flight capital exported out of the country by corrupt dictators. Those people have made profits three times over, yet their paid apologists come to this Committee and seek to move us to tears on their behalf. That is quite extraordinary.<br><br>
On what the banks were really up to in the 1970s, one economist said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the most aggressive banks… . have probably accumulated almost as much in assets from poor countries as they have loaned to them. Their real role has been to take funds that Third World elites have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
stolen from their governments and to loan them back, earning a nice spread each way."</p></blockquote>
Having had that nice little earner three times over, the banks are now asking for tax relief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that those elites were mainly socialist? The money was lent mainly to socialist Third-world Governments in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the hon. Gentleman's extensive knowledge of foreign affairs. But by no means could President Marcos have been described as a socialist. His was the kind of elite to which the bankers unwisely lent money. First, they said that they did it under pressure, then that the money was spent on humanitarian projects. But the largest proportion was spent on arms by military dictators. So can we have less of the humanitarian aspect and how the bankers were doing it only because they had to? They lent unwisely, on the premise that countries could not go bust, which provided to be false. They have made their money many times over and Opposition Members will not support amendments proposed by paid apologists for capitalism.<br><br>
We are used to Conservative Members acting as paid apologists for capitalism. However, we cannot swallow—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. Thee are no paid apologists for capitalism on the Conservative Benches. Every Conservative Member on the Committee is a committed capitalist, whether paid or unpaid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the correction. We are used to Conservative Members acting as unpaid apologists for capitalism. What we find hard to stomach is that they should do so for incompetent capitalists. If the market is to mean anything, people should bear their losses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak to this very significant clause, I ought to declare an interest. I am a director of Dewe Rogerson, not that that is particularly relevant in this context. I am also a consultant to a merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell and for a number of years—until shortly after I was elected—I was a director of that bank. When I was on the board, we had a portfolio of country risk assets—the kind of loans that the clause targets. We made a number of specific provisions against them, one or two at my instigations, and received tax relief. We also made some general provision, for prudential reasons, on which there was no tax relief.<br><br>
Since I resigned from the board, my colleagues may have succeeded in fully providing against or otherwise liquidating that portfolio. I deliberately did not ask them whether they have before I came to the Committee this afternoon, because I am not speaking in the interest of Morgan Grenfell or of those banks which are chiefly impacted by the clause—the clearing banks and other commercial banks.<br><br>
You know the City, Mr. Cormack, and on the whole, merchant banks do not have a reputation for being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
particularly indulgent of the follies and errors made by the clearers or other commercial banks. Nor are they very sympathetic to the vicissitudes that the clearers suffer from time to time.<br><br>
There are at least two issues raised by the clause which are far more important than the mere commercial interests of any sector of economic activity or group of men and women in this country. First, the clause affects the integrity and transparency of the fiscal system.<br><br>
By integrity, I mean the even-handedness of the tax system. We do not distinguish between people because one derives income from the practice of medicine and another from metallurgy. Nor do we distinguish between the company that derives its income from a restaurant and that which operates a chemical plant. That principle is important, and the Committee will agree that it is essential to the integrity of our fiscal system.<br><br>
By transparency, I mean that the principles of taxation and the rules under which they are implemented should be clear. Until I read the clause a few days ago, I had not believed that that principle had been seriously challenged. I had thought that there was no doubt about what was taxable—a person's income, a corporation's profit, and, except in certain defined circumstances, the capital gains of both. It would be possible to tax other things. One could conceive of a system that would tax cash flow. No doubt my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary could quickly think of 10 good reasons why that would be economically disastrous, but it is possible. We could tax assets, althought there are sound reasons for not doing so. We could tax windows, as happened in the 18th century. We could tax the number of rubber plants in our corporations' offices. That might be an attractive idea. We do not, however, tax those items. We tax income and profits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could have a roof tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) for reminding me that a roof tax has been proposed. He has put his finger on the fact that not all hon. Members in this room believe in a simple, transparent tax system. Some hon. Members have dreamt up the most perverse taxes, with the most perverse social and economic implications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has omitted to mention the tax that is levied against everyone, except those on the lowest incomes, regardless of their ability to pay. The Government have explored that possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make many mistakes, but the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) knows that I never underestimate the capacity of Opposition parties to dream up any number of taxes, all of which have the most curious features.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Is he aware that the Opposition are entertaining the most perverse and crazy idea of all—that of reintroducing the rates?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That may well be true, but they are not doing so here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respect your admonition, Mr. Cormack, and shall refuse the great temptation to follow my hon. Friend down that path.<br><br>
Taxation in this country is not arbitrary, as it was under the medieval feudal system, or in the Ottoman empire, or in totalitarian regimes elsewhere in the world. In such systems, the goods of citizens and companies are seized, wilfully and without rhyme or reason, in accordance only with the rapacity of the taxing authorities. Especially in connection with corporate income, it has always been clear that we tax profit. Profit, unlike cash flow, is never a precisely definable quantity. Its concept, however, can be clearly defined. It is the increase of a company's value in one financial period, over the previous financial period.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Many judgmental elements determine profit, such as provisioning, depreciation policy, good will, the capitalisation of other intangibles and the treatment of inventories. The means of tackling inflation and whether one chooses to ignore it under historic conventions, is also a determining factor. In Britain, we have resolved the tension between the need for a definable generally accepted notion of profit and the theoretical impossibility of reaching a quantitative definition. That is accomplished by a series of rules and accounting conventions, which are enforced by the accountancy profession. I am not an accountant so it is easier for me to pay tribute to a profession that is well represented on the Committee.<br><br>
If it were not for that profession, which has an awesome responsibility for applying rules and conventions, companies, their employees suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders would not know where they stood. There would be neither financial prudence in the management of industry and commerce, nor transparency; neither competence, nor honesty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins<span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's flow. Will he say some words of praise for those who audited the books of Ferranti, British and Commonwealth and Dunsdale Securities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Cormack, that you do not wish me to be drawn down that road. I am too old a chicken and have been in the business world too long to make a statement about accounts that I have not examined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman apply that rule to any speech that he makes about the national Exchequer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endeavour to apply that rule to all my speeches, including this one. I have attempted to consider all the relevant facts to which I have access, before speaking. I am sure that all hon. Members do that—I claim no monopoly on it. I hope that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) is not accusing me of undue carelessness in handling
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
the facts. When he reads my speech in Hansard, he will not be able to sustain such a charge.<br><br>
I believed that the essence of my description of the tax situation and the interrelationship between financial management and our fiscal system, was supported by the whole Committee. It is difficult to reconcile that picture with the clause. I do not accuse the Government of explicity attacking any of the principles and assumptions that I described. I am sure that, when I have sat down, I shall be thoroughly persuaded by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that I have no grounds for concern. For a layman such as myself—I am no tax expert—it is difficult to reconcile the clause with the tax regime that I described. Others outside this room may have experienced the same difficulty when reading the Bill. My hon. Friend should deal as clearly as possible with the points that I shall make.<br><br>
If I read it alright, the clause proposes not to tax banks on their profits, in the sense that I have used the word. The excess of their income over their losses and costs will not be the figure that the Revenue will use to assess tax liability. It will not matter whether the management of a bank agrees with its auditors that a certain level of provisioning for country risk assets is sound and justifiable. It will not matter whether that view of prudential provision is based on the collective wisdom of the central banking world—the Bank of England or the Bank for International Settlements. Most remarkably, it will not matter whether provisioning relates to the actual value of the country risk assets held by that bank as assessed by the market.<br><br>
There is an effective secondary market in country risk debt. I have the April issue of the <i>International Financial Review,</i> which sets out the prices currently quoted in that market. The bid/offer spread on Argentina is 13 to 13.75 per cent, on Poland 15 to 15.875 per cent, and on Nigeria 24.775 to 25.375 per cent. The margin of the spreads quoted is very fine. That shows a liquid and technically efficient market—a genuine market. It will not matter whether banks' country risk assets are priced to be consistent with that market because, for this part of their business, banks will be assessed for the next two years under an Inland Revenue matrix which no one here has yet had the privilege of seeing. Beyond that, banks will be assessed at a rate that cannot involve a level of provisioning of 5 per cent per annum less than the amount established by the matrix.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that a sufficient proportion of outstanding debt is traded to make the market realistic, not in the sense that it operates for those who participate in it, but as a means of judging the value or cost of the outstanding debt?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As I have just explained, evidence of that is the narrowness of the bid/offer spread. The greater the volume of transactions, the greater the efficiency of a market. That is true of tea commodities, stocks, the foreign exchange market or any other market the hon. Gentleman cares to name. The greater the volume of transactions, the greater will be the likelihood that market makers will quote low spreads. The fewer the transactions, the wider the spreads have to be to protect the market maker. An impressive list of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
financial institutions are presently involved in that business, especially in the United States.<br><br>
I hope that I have misunderstood the effect of the clause. Indeed, 1 am confident that my fears are groundless. I raise them only because I am not the only person to have been worried when I read the Bill. I have not spoken to clearing banks about the clause and I do not propose to do so, but I hope that my speech will give my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary an opportunity to assure us that there is nothing to worry about.<br><br>
If my interpretation were correct, many people who are invloved in a range of activities and economic sectors will be worried. Market makers in the securitiesbusinessߞ</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I help my hon. Friend? Before his extensive worries become more extensive, may I say that his fears are unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is most reassuring. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will make my day if he can use those same words at the end of the next part of my speech, because another policy issue is impacted by the clause. It is entirely different from the issue of accounting and provisioning of banks.<br><br>
We use the tax system to bias the activities of any economic agent in one direction or another, but do we wish to create a bias against lending to developing, Third world and east European countries? In such countries, it is likely that no one can borrow without the endorsement of the state institution. That means that any loans thus made will be caught by the clause.<br><br>
My understanding is that if banks make loans to real estate or to shipping—not a particularly happy experience for most commercial banks—or to private individuals, and make profits, those profits will be taxable after the deduction of any losses incurred, but if those banks lend to countries, under the provisions of the clause, profits will be taxable, but losses will not be immediately deductible and because of the time value of money, the element of deduction may be of little effective value to those banks.<br><br>
In practice, that transforms the risk reward ratio for any bank that lends to the developing or third world, or to any country caught by the clause, so inevitably, if my interpretation is correct, either those banks will demand a higher remuneration by increasing their spread or commission on the loan, or they will not lend at all. The effect of the clause will be to discourage British banks from supplying more debt finance to such countries.<br><br>
Perhaps I have misunderstood that aspect, too, I shall be really delighted if my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary can tell me that I am also wrong in this part of my interpretation of the clause, but if I am not entirely wrong, I hope that he can reassure me that that was not the Government's fundamental. intention.<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. I do not wish to challenge your ruling, but we have three further groups of amendments to discuss. I deliberately truncated my remarks on this amendment because I wanted to say more on others. I hope that your ruling does not prevent me from doing so, Mr. Cormack.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Absolutely not, but we have had a wide-ranging degbate. Of course the other amendments will be debated and, within reason, the hon. Member can say what he wants, but the Chair always has the discretion to decide whether there will be a clause stand part debate. As the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding has ranged so wide, we have covered many points, but I invite him to bring his eloquence to an early close.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Cormack, I am close to the end of my remarks. I took advice before speaking to this amendment and decided to make general remarks because other members of the Committee had mentioned matters of general principle that are raised by the clause.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will say that they did not intend the clause to have a perverse effect on the willingness of British lenders to lend to certain categories of country. I highlighted that theoretical danger. I hope that the Government will remedy the matter by introducing an amendment. I shall not pit my own wits against those of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and his advisers and attempt to come up with an amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen<span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose it shows how far the political process has degraded in this country when Conservative Members want to claim credit for their involvement in Third world debt. They seem to claim with pride that they were personally involved with loans and seek to apologise for the banks' actions in the Third world where a human and environmental holocaust has been produced.<br><br>
In the 1970s, the banks were anxious to ram money down the throats of leaders in the third world, whether they were socialist or capitalist elitists, or Fascist dictators, but those who suffered as a result of the burden placed on them by such loans were the people who were starving or who had lost their land. In the 1980s, the situation was almost the same, but the banks realised, in Dracula fashion, that it was no good killing off the victim because the supply of blood would dry up. The victim had to be kept alive. If interest is to continue to be paid or the principal to be repaid, Third world economies must be kept afloat. The banks, the International Monetary Fund and the other organisations involved are not doing that through any generosity of spirit, but merely to continue the process of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
extracting money from Third world nations. I am surprised that Conservative members puff out their chests with pride and say that they were involved in that process. I hope that, in due course, the Labour Front Bench will put these and other matters right when a Government that is motivated by a different morality is elected.<br><br>
Government information on this matter is relatively difficult to come by. Even for someone who asks a number of parliamentary questions, it has taken some effort to get to some of the basic information. I thank the Economic Secretary, who finally told me that while individual outstanding debts with banks were not registered with the Treasury, it had a global total.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"United Kingdom banks' claims on developing countries at the end of 1989 were £53 billion."</p></blockquote>
I presume no humour was intended in the final line:
<br><blockquote><p>"Lending by the British banks is for their own commercial judgment. "—[Official Report, 18 May 1990: Vol. 172, c. 572-3.]</p></blockquote>
That was the very last quality that was exercised during the 1970s and 1980s. All the fine talk about risk-taking entrepreneurs seems also to have found itself on the rocks, as large amounts of money ensure that the risks were never taken in the first place. It is the philosophy of, "You win some, you lose some, but you win some even if you lose some." The idea is that there is always a safety net, and whatever outrageous loans are made, no matter with whom, the good old British taxpayer and bank customer can come along and bale the bank out if it has not made profits on the loan.<br><br>
All this is a sad commentary on the Government's philosophy about a free market. The third world countries would be the first to say that the free market does not exist in this instance. Third world economies are essentially totally unfree; They are the captive economies of the large industrialised economies—the battery hens and milk cows of large international capital—and they need to be kept alive so that they can supply debt repayments to the system that originally lent money to them.<br><br>
Nothing illustrates that better than the control exercised by industrial countries of the various commodity markets. Many Third world countries are wholly at the mercy of one given commodity price—say, copper or maize—on which an economy has been made dependent by historical development and intervention by the western economies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that Third world debtor countries' problems are certainly not brought on themselves? They suffered from the massive hike in interest rates in the 1980s and from commodity prices falling through the floor. Having borrowed money at relatively low rates of interest during times of relatively high growth, they have been faced in the 1980s with zero growth and astronomic interest rates. Those rates are not their responsibility but the responsibility of the banks in Britain, America and the G7 countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott), indeed she has anticipated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
several of my points. The poorest countries of the world do not receive finance to invest in rebuilding their economies; they receive money to pay back some of the interest on the loans already received. They are captured in that cycle, so any attempt to disguise what the Government and, even more, the major banks are doing as some sort of charitable exercise is a complete sham and con.<br><br>
The countries now in debt are suffering an additional burden because of environmental problems. To repay even the amounts that they are able to repay, they need further to deplete their natural resources. These problems come home to roost. We saw that with the impact of global warming, as many Third world countries have to use up their natural resources—in this case their woodlands and forest—to earn hard currency to pay back the debts that they have already incurred.<br><br>
There are appalling consequences in that sense as well as the most obvious and direct consequence of individuals starving. According to a document I have here,
<br><blockquote><p>"UNICEF estimates that in the 12 months preceding the publication of their State of the World's Children report 1989 at least half a million young children died due to the burden on their countries of debt and recession. (This docs not include child deaths in countries affected by war or civil strife)."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to make too much of a moral point about hon. Members who have spoken with pride about their involvement in Third world debt, but 1 believe that they should examine their consciences and ask whether they can sleep easy at night given the burden that they must bear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is saying is the typical load of sanctimonious claptrap that we have come to expect from him. It is his hallmark. He might also tell us how many lives were saved by the support that companies and banks gave to the building of new hospitals and medical facilities in Third world countries—or peerhaps he is not interested in that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The examples that the hon. Gentleman quotes are commendable. I regret that much of the lending went on, for example, military hardware and lined the pockets of dictators. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was involved in such lending, whether he cared where the money went or whether, when such lending takes place, such considerations are part of any contractual obligation. I do not know whether people like the hon. Gentleman and others in his trade state whether the money is for hospitals or for infrastructure developments. I think that they are interested only in the bottom line—whether they will get their money back. It seems that even in that limited context they cannot get it right. If I am wrong, the hon. Gentleman is welcome to intervene to put me right. Perhaps he lends for specific projects all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is unbelievably ignorant if he does not realise that banks have no money of their own. All they have is the money that their depositors lend them. It is not their own mney and they need to make a return on the money to pay the depositors. The hon. Gentleman is so utterly ignorant that, on an occasion like this there is no point in trying to inform and educate him: he is beyond educating.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'> Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might ask the hon. Gentleman exactly the same question again, Mr. Cormack.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. No. We cannot have an interrogatory session. The hon. Gentleman is making a speech and if he is intervened on, fair enough. Otherwise, he must make his own speech in his own way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Cormack. I assumed that as the answer to my question had not been provided, the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) may not have heard the original question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we could do with less sanctimonious claptrap about the money being spent on schools and hospitals? The bulk of third world debt went on flight capital, armaments and prestige projects such as nuclear power stations that have never been used. Far from the money having been spent on hospitals and schools, the consequence of the crippling burden of debt repayment in the third world during the 1980s has been a drop in welfare, educational and health standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting out of hand. This is supposed to be an intervention on the speech being made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). While the hon. Lady is entirely at liberty to intervene, she should do so with a certain amount of conciseness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found ny hon. Friend's intervention very helpful. However, an even better intervention—one that the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood may appreciate—was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the IMF-World Bank development committee. He did not say that a lot of cash was being spent on hospitals and that the big bankers were lending our money for projects on infrastructure and so on. He said that there were still too many cases of
<br><blockquote><p>"questionable military purchases and white elephant public sector projects in the developing world."</p></blockquote>
The problem they had persists, and the Chancellor recognises it, in his rhetoric if not in his actions.<br><br>
The result of all the lending is that the third world countries tried to stand on their own two feet and to drag themselves out of their problems, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) said, they are not standing still as a result of having to pay back loan upon loan that the banks have so kindly given them, they are declining as viable economies. My hon. Friends gave examples, and there are many others, which I could quote, should Conservative Members need them. Much of the debt that third world countries have incurred did not benefit the poor and needy, the people who needed to be encouraged to develop the indigenous economies. Those are the facts, which the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood seems not to recognise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Gentleman think about the merits of my amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to return to the merits of the hon. Gentleman's amendment if it catches my attention, but it has not so far.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. When I opened the debate, I understood that it would be about my amendment. So far, only two members of the Committee have addressed themselves to the amendment—the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and me. I am anxious about the way in which the debate is developing. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth), but little time during the debate has been spent on the merits of my amendment. If I had known at the start of the debate that it would be so wide-ranging, I would have made a longer speech. I sat down 1 hour and 22 minutes ago. There are many things that I wanted to say but, in the light of what has occurred and your ruling about the stand part debate, Mr. Cormack, it may not be possible to say them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman is always in a slightly difficult position. What hon. Members have said is broadly relevant. The hon. Gentleman is right—there has not been much reference to his amendment. I made my ruling, and hon. Members should have regard to the amendment under discussion. The hon. Member for Nottingham (Mr. Allen) is making a lengthy speech, admittedly in response to an even more lengthy speech. Perhaps he could take note of that. He was out of order when he said a moment ago that he was not concerned with the amendment, because if he was not so concerned, he should not have sought to catch my eye. We are not considering the merits or otherwise of what happened in the past, but the taxing of lending institutions. We should return to that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, Mr. Cormack, I shall adhere closely to your ruling. The hon. Member for Bea-consfield (Mr. Smith) knows that I did not speak until the matter of clause stand part was raised. I am happy to speak on that subject. I intended no disrespect to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield or his amendment, which I understand does little to assist people in the third world.<br><br>
I spoke earlier of the difficulty with obtaining information from the Treasury on these matters. What little I have found out about the role of the Inland Reveue causes concern because of the lack of information about how it negotiates with banks, and how speedy it is when debts are incurred.<br><br>
I have had several dealings, via the Public Accounts Committee, with the excellent staff at the Inland Revenue and have the greatest regard for their professionalism. But without full information about how decisions are taken in all such respects, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee should be worried. If the banks can exercise leverage on the Inland Revenue and, politically, we do not know how it is exercised, decision-making can be done in darkened rooms without the bright glare of exposure in this House and elsewhere.<br><br>
We should learn one or two lessons, which may be extremely relevant to our consideration of the clause. With the democractic explosion in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the same people who did the hard sell on the third world in the 1960s and 1970s are creeping across, courtesy of know-how grants or on their own little donkeys, to eastern Europe areas to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
extract and negotiate loans with a new set of leaders, perhaps inexperienced leaders who are unfamiliar with the shenanigans of the City of London and elsewhere—people who, in desperation, may tie their economies into a cycle of debt. That is a word of caution for those economies and, I hope, a word for the future for my hon. Friends on the Front Bench.<br><br>
We need to consider afresh the practice of tax handouts to the banks. That may not be done in this Committee this year, but further examination is necessary to ascertain whether it is legitimate to write off, through taxpayers' money, debts which have allegedly been incurred by risk takers. Perhaps there should be an examination of insurance to ascertain whether that would benefit banks' liquidity. That needs to be considered at greater length than I can do today.<br><br>
The debts are alleged to be bad. As far as I can tell, they are pretty good debts: they can be written down by courtesy of the British taxpayer. Those who led their banks into those circumstances escape almost entirely from the consequences of their own poor judgment. If banks lent money on their own commercial judgment, I have reservations about how far we should bale them out. But if we must do so, in future there should be a regulation about the basis on which banks receive large amounts of money from the Exchequer and the taxpayer. There must be control so that when lending occurs it is made clear in the first instance to the taxpayer, who may eventually fork out for poor commercial judgment, where that money is going and for what purpose. If banks wish to put bad debts from that lending back on to the British taxpayer, there must be a quid pro quo for that major insurance policy which the Treasury operates on their behalf.<br><br>
In his dynamic and vital speech, the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) spoke of different taxes. This is probably the worst tax of all. Of course, it is a tax on the British taxpayer who must bale people out. But it is also a tax on the people of the third world. They are not responsible for it having been levied upon them. They do not elect the banks that made the initial loans. In many instances, they did not even benefit from the loans to their countries because the benefits accrued to individuals—to the dictators or whoever received them.<br><br>
The Government's seeking to spread the relief on debts over a longer period may—to return to domestic politics—have another motive: if the burden is spread over a number of years, less money will be paid out in a given year. As with today's announcement of the cancellation of the high-speed rail link, this will mean, in the short term, no major increase in public expenditure from this area at least. That is good news for the building up of a general election kitty but, once again, it may not be relevant, or be good news, for the people of the third world. I urge my hon. Friends to think hard about the provisions that we shall need to introduce in either next year's Finance Bill or the 1992 Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). My sympathies for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
people of the third world ought to be in more or less the same place. However, I am increasingly befogged not only by the high moral tone but by the confusion of objectives on whether banks were organisations that handled other people's money on their behalf or organisations which possessed their own money which they were entitled to use fully and profitably in whichever way seemed to them to be for the general good. I am also confused about whether our debate is about what is appropriate to be taxed as profit or loss or about ways of punishing banks for the undoubted folly of their actions of earlier years.<br><br>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), whose comments I regret having missed due to my attendance at a minsterial meeting that affected my constituency, are considered from the viewpoint of a person who is keen to ensure—although perhaps not as extremely as his hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies)—that the integrity and transparency of the taxation system are not damaged by his proposal.<br><br>
One proposal would reduce the Treasury's discretion to test the principles that the hon. Gentleman set out in amendment No. 62, which was not selected in this group but which sets out Bank of England matrix principles which could be applied to assessing whether a bank was losing a great deal of money and failing to make profit from certain types of debt. I was waiting for the ministerial response to the amendments which might reduce the Treasury's ability to operate the scheme in such a way as to ensure that we did not give the banks benefit to which they were not entitled but ensured that we legitimately tested whether they were making the losses that they claimed.<br><br>
It is possible to examine the issue on the basis of how it will affect the integrity of the tax system. It is also possible to ask, as Opposition Members have done, how we can punish the bad behaviour of banks and of Governments. But, again, confusion arose over hon. Members' views. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) rightly pointed out more than once that much of this money went not to the welfare of peoples but for the aggrandisement of leaders, the purchase of weapons and the promotion of ends that had little to do with peoples welfare.<br><br>
However, it is not possible to claim that we should have lent those countries more money or in some way channelled more money to the same Governments to inflict further damage on their people. It all speaks for a new approach towards assisting the economics of developing countries, as international bodies have tried to find, so that assistance is in some way associated with measures that will lead to economic change and the genuine economic development of those countries. It is difficult to do that without appearing totally colonialist. At times, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North sounded more of a colonialist than anyone that I have heard for a long time. He envisaged banks asking those countries, "What will you use this money for? How many votes did you poll? Which of your people will benefit, and in which ways?" That would be an odd role for an unelected bank. It would be a more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
legitimate role for the International Monetary Fund in trying to establish the basis on which nations could get together to try to sort out this mess.<br><br>
There are two ways in which the problem has been looked at: the integrity of the tax system and the morality of the banks. The point of view that I shall take, which is implicit in some of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, is to ask how we can reduce or bring to an end the problem of indebtedness for those countries without destroying the integrity of the banking system or making it impossible for countries to borrow money in future to assist their people.<br><br>
Once again I find it difficult to understand the reasoning of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North who seemed to imply that there should be no commercial lending to eastern Europe. I look forward to going to eastern Europe with the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington in a couple of weeks to find out the lending needs of those countries. I expect at least some of that need to be met from commercial lending sources more sensibly, not as a prelude to the sort of disaster that has occurred and to which the amendments are directed.<br><br>
I was puzzled by the implication from the hon. Member for Nottingham, North that there should be no commercial lending to eastern Europe.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder, even speaking from ignorance, if I can help the hon. Gentleman. History has passed him by in respect of our specifying that one loan must go to a hospital or another towards road building, because so many of the loans that we are talking about will be used to pay interest on earlier loans.<br><br>
I am not saying that commercial lending is bad, only the terms of such lending, particularly to eastern Europe. We should try to help eastern Europe on even wider terms than straightforward commercial lending, such as a wider Marshall plan, through aid, education, democratic procedures and so on, over and above straightforwardly tying people for ever into a cycle of international debt as we did with the third world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman's second point. This is all about trying to break that cycle, particularly when countries borrow to pay the interest on existing debts. That is such a disastrous course that the world community is looking at ways of avoiding it.<br><br>
One of my fears is that the apparent ending of a general danger to the banking system has reduced the impetus for doing something. It is no longer the received wisdom that the world banking system is under threat because of the scale of the problem. It is now seen as a containable problem within the banking system.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will agree that it is not a containable problem for many of the debtor countries. We must therefore look for ways to get them out of this terrible cycle of fresh borrowing to finance existing debts. Indeed, if countries are not doing that we should try to get them away from the level of dependence which they now have. All that is required is economic change.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
The proposals can play only a limited part and, in some ways, they are hinged to the concepts of a Brady plan which itself will play only a limited part in solving this problem. The Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee made it clear that its expectations for the Brady plan were small. It may help Mexico, but it will not get much further than that. The world community has not yet addressed the scale of this problem.<br><br>
In doing all this it is not possible to treat banks as if they were not the custodians of other people's money. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North was misleading in his suggestion that banks generally, at least now, were trying to take moral credit by saying that they were doing their best to help third world countries. When the Select Committee saw the chairmen of some of the main banks involved, it was left in no doubt that the banks were acting on behalf of their shareholders and thought that they were doing so in the first instance even when they made ill-advised loans—banks made many ill-advised loans to agriculture in this country at the same time. Banks believe that they are acting in their shareholders' interests with the attitude that they now adopt.<br><br>
Perhaps we can draw from the banks a greater degree of cooperation and encourage them to be more adventurous. We could frame the provisions to give scope for a wider range of mechanisms such as debt/equity swaps to deal with the problem.<br><br>
Banks are custodians of other people's money, on which they have to earn a return that is then paid out to those people—including our constituents, holders of bank savings, pensioners and many others. Banks are not entitled to play around with that money; indeed, they ought not to use it ill-advisedly, as they sometimes do.<br><br>
The Bill is intended to assist the world community to address that problem. It is a limited move in that direction. I fear that the amendments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield might further restrict the Bill's ability to persuade the banks to address more urgently the problem of changing the debt position of the countries that they have dealt with in the past. Do the Government see the Bill—playing any more than the rather limited role that I have outlined? Do they fear, as I do, that to restrict the banks further would be to make them almost inoperative in a field where we desperately need some action? Amendments have been tabled that seem to widen the Bill's effect, but they are only a small contribution to a large problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to respond as briefly as I can. Unlike so many members of the Committee, I cannot claim to have been a banker lending money during the relevant period. For many years, I was working in under-developed countries advising their Governments on how aid or other money should be spent, but I ceased to do so just as those bad debts were first incurred. I assume that there may be some post hoc, ergo propter hoc relationship, as they no longer have the benefit of my good advice.<br><br>
I shall respond first to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). Sovereign debt is sui generis. As my hon. friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) said, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
same law should apply to all companies. That is so, broadly speaking. But the same law has to be applied in different circumstances. Sovereign debt is sui generis because states do not go bankrupt or disappear, whereas in commerce one lends to people who can go into liquidation or simply disappear. Subjective assessments have to be made for sovereign debt about how much will be reimbursed and when. That assessment has to be made before the end of the loan period and certainly before the end of rescheduled loans.<br><br>
For that reason, in deciding the amount that should be provisioned, the banks set up a matrix. That became the standard by which that subjective judgment was quantified—also for the purposes of taxation. We seek to provide certainty by putting the elements of that matrix into law so that the banks will know the basis, rather than it having evolved, and making it more precise.<br><br>
The Bank of England's matrix produces a range, whereas ours will produce a point; the outcome will be an exact number rather than a range within which further judgment has to be made. We are also phasing the burden on the Exchequer by which sudden changes in the prospects for debt can result in an immediate increase in write offs against tax. But we are not reducing the assessment of debt that may be written off by the banks. The figures should remain essentially the same. No substantive change is being made in the amount of loss that may be written off; the clause alters only the phasing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend agree that, should the position of a borrower deteriorate further subsequent to the introduction of the matrix, that will not be recognised by allowing the bank to make further provision, except within the 5 per cent per annum rule set out in the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I mean by phasing. If the matrix shows that there has been a deterioration of 20 per cent, as in the illustration given by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, the full 20 per cent will be allowable, but it must be taken in steps of a maximum of 5 per cent each year. The total amount will be allowable in full over ensuring years.<br><br>
The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield looks for a symmetrical provision if the news turns good and less provision and less write-off is needed. The banks should therefore not have to repay the relief they have received in chunks of more than 5 per cent per annum. The 20 per cent bad debt to which my hon. Friend referred may suddenly become a good debt as the prospects of the borrowing country improve and it seems that it will be able repay the loan. My hon. Friend is saying that the relief should not be repayable in one year but be spread over five years.<br><br>
The only argument in favour of my hon. Friend's suggestion is the one of symmetry, which is not to me the most forceful of arguments. In such circumstances, the bank will be in a happy position: the outlook is rosier and the bank can scarcely be said to be suffering hardship. I cannot say why it should be allowed to retain relief for a number of years just in order to achieve symmetry and because we believe that the burden on the Exchequer should be phased. We are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
usually considering decisions that are made about prospective, rather than past, events.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) successfully implicated the Governments of both the creditor and the recipient nations, as well as the aid lobby, in the errors that the banks appear to have made in creating debts that were subsequently not repaid. I am not sure that a blame shared is a blame exculpated. "So what?", is one's natural answer. My hon. Friend made is point at some length, and I shall endeavour not to emulate him in my reply. He said that the principal blame arose because the banks gave in to pressure and to advice to make altruistic decisions. I know that at the time I tried to make my own bank manager take an altruistic view about the amount of money that he should lend to me and to ignore the fact that it might not be repaid, and that he was not as open to persuasion as my hon. Friend suggests bankers were then.<br><br>
A somewhat symmetrical point was made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) and others. They said that the countries themselves could be exonerated from blame for having borrowed money that they could not repay, that it had been forced upon them by the banks, that we should therefore introduce tax measures that penalised the banks, and that the recipients of the loans were in some way whiter than white. I find that an equally difficult argument to buy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No Opposition Member argued that the politicians who borrowed the money were not to blame. We are saying that the current populations of those countries were not involved in the decisions to borrow and did not benefit from those decisions to borrow, so we do not think that they should be made to suffer unduly just to benefit bankers.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the clause or the treatment of bad debt makes them suffer. However, it follows from the argument of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) and of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North that if those countries cannot be trusted to use well money which is lent to them, they presumably cannot be trusted to use well money that is given to them. The Opposition's argument that we should vastly increase aid to those con-tries disappears down the spout. I am puzzled by their patronising view of the third world, which I do not believe they would wish to utter outside the comparative seclusion of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Financial Secretary realises that that makes the case for aid to non-governmental organisations even stronger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Always assuming that such non-governmental organisations have ways of using that aid effectively. I endorse the policy of the Government to increase, and we have done, the proportion of aid that is channelled through non-governmental organisations. I have found from my experience on the ground that that is invariably the most effective way of channelling aid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that comment, will the Financial Secretary support vigorously Opposition

amendment No. 193 when we come to it? It seeks to use the mechanism of debt reduction via debt for development swaps involving such voluntary organisations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall see about that when we come to discuss the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not tell me that the brief has not already been written.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) made a commendably brief and pithy contribution, on which I congratulate him. His main point was that the measures are not wrong but should do more to encourgae debt forgiveness. Debt forgiveness should be based on commercial judgment, and tax should not distort that judgment. There is scope for voluntary commercial debt reduction and we welcome the growing options for banks and the rapid action by the International Monetary Fund and World bank to institute the Brady initiative.<br><br>
The Bill increases the relative attractions of debt reduction schemes and the clause avoids any penalty on rescheduling. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) asked whether that involved taxing bank profits, and the answer is no. It will affect only the timing of relief. The Inland Revenue's regulations will be published in due course and will follow broadly the Bank of England matrix. That change provides certainty, not a windfall tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary said that debt reduction was a mattter for commercial judgment. That is not the view of the United States Government, who believe strongly that with current prices debt reduction is a matter for Governments. That is one of the points that the Opposition are trying to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, Governments are involved in reducing debt and we have forgiven almost £ 1 billion of debt in undeveloped countries. We welcome other Governments who follow our example on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Financial Secretary on the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott). The Financial Secretary said that the tax system should not distort commercial judgment on the forgiveness of debt. The United States Treasury Secretary, Mr. Brady, said when launching the Brady iniative that
<br><blockquote><p>"creditor governments should consider how to reduce regulatory, accounting or tax impediments to debt reduction where these exist."</p></blockquote>
He advocated examining how the tax system could be used as an incentive for debt reduction. The Financial Secreatry appears to be ruling that out in principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. What the hon. Gentleman said was compatible with what I said. We want to remove impediments, which are a form of distortion, and do not wish to see distortions in the tax or regulatory systems. We have taken a full part in trying to avoid such impediments.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham asked whether there would be an increase in certainty for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
non-sovereign debt, as has happened for sovereign debt. The Revenue is still discussing the position for private-sector debt in those countries. It varies from case to case, but it hopes to agree guidelines soon. Government amendments Nos. 135 to 137 will apply the new restrictions to such debts but do not guarantee matrix level relief.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) asked several questions and earnestly requested that I might reassure him that he was mistaken. I can fulfil that earnest request in most instances, as I believe that he thinks that the change will have a far more onerous impact than it will. There is no basic change in the definition of profit or loss, or what may be written off effectively as a cost of borrowing on bad debts. There will be a change in phasing only. My hon Friend suggested that phasing might make lending to under-developed countries a less attractive option, but I believe that the widespread debt problem does that. Our proposed change will not make much difference one way or another.<br><br>
When circumstances improve, either because of the resolution of the debt problem or an improvement in the economic climate—those are not unrelated—I believe that bankers will resume their borrowing and I look forward to that day. It is unlikely that bankers assess their borrowing on the presumption that it will all fail, and then check the phasing provisions on the debt relief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way and for his clear exposition of the clause.<br><br>
Has the Minister any inkling at present about the amount of provision being sought by banks that will incur relief next year? Is part of the reason for smoothing out the phasing in of the amount of relief to ensure that the public expenditure foregone by giving tax relief is fairly predictable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes I think that we showed in the Red Book that the yield of the measure would be about £200 million. By applying the tax rate to that, we can work out how much debt we believe will be phased. Effectively, we are freezing the amount of debt that can be taken at last year's level for a year or so, and by allowing increments of 5 per cent per annum, we can work out the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. He is probably better at mental arithmetic than me, but it is quite a large sum. It will be relieved in due course, but it will be phased.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister a little further on that point? Would the amount that would have been paid, were a phasing system not in place, be higher for the coming year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it will be about £200 million higher, if I remember the figure correctly.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding complained that the clause would not reflect secondary market prices. That never happened, so we are not changing anything. The law has always been that when a debt becomes bad, it may be written off, but there is no provision, as for inventories, for taking
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
the lower book and market value for debts. That applies equally to companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful and say sincerely that I am greatly releved to hear what my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said. To make a correction, I was not suggesting that provisioning should necessarily be based on secondary market prices but was merely saying that, as far as I understood the clause, neither the decisions of auditors, bankers and the Bank of England nor secondary market prices would be taken into account. All those considerations would be subsumed by the new Inland Revenue matrix. From the rmarks made by the Financial Secretary, it is clear that that matrix will be much closer to the Bank of England's matrix in practice than many people had understood until now. We must be grateful for that assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have clarified that point and sorry not to have done so earlier.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North asked about the negotiations that take place with the Inland Revenue, and their length. The existing law is clear, but because its application to the essentially subjective evaluation of what is and is not a bad debt is difficult, discussions have to take place and agreement must be reached. The length of such negotiations is as long as a piece of string. With regard to tax, the law is clear but the world is complex, so one must try to reach agreement with one's tax inspector over a period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found the concept so difficult because a bad debt, which in this instance attracts relief, may not even be a bad debt but one which could be repaid in future. If that is the current judgment of the Inland Revenue, obviously, there is a great need for definition of what is a bad debt. To a layman such as me, a bad debt is one that is irrecoverable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's difficulty in finding words which can simultaneously express the irrecoverability of debts and make allowance for the fact that circumstances change and they become recoverable. However, that is life.<br><br>
I understand the purpose of the amendments and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made an effective case for them, but they do not merit our acceptance. They do not deal with a major objection of some banks to that change, so I hope that my hon. Friend will seek leave to withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has certainly been a wide-ranging debate and I make it clear that I share the worry expressed by many members of the Committee about the great burden which has been placed upon less-developed countries by the weight of debt that we discussed. However, I do not believe that the solution lies in the United Kingdom's corporation tax system or, more especially, in clause 66. I believe that there are other solutions which are outside the scope of the debate on my amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) recently discussed policies with the Brazilians. That country has a large debt problem but it now has a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
sensible, Right-wing, market-oriented Government who are looking at radical ways of sorting out that problem. For example, they are considering, as part of a major privatisation programme, converting some of the debt into equity holdings in newly-privatised companies.<br><br>
The solutions need not necessarily involve environmental consequences of the sort described by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) who was worried about further environmental damage. There can be commonsense solutions to all the problems, but they do not lie in clause 66 of the Finance Bill and my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary did not suggest that that was what the Government has in mind. First, he said that the Government wanted to clarify the position and I welcome that. Secondly, he was candid in wanting to phase the burden on the Exchequer. I have difficulty with that point but I understand that he wants to protect the Revenue, so the timing of the relief is important.<br><br>
In his excellent speech my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) talked about the integrity of the tax system and referred to accounting. We should have a system in which the reported profits for accounts purposes are as near as possible to the actual taxable profits. We all know that there are reasons why those cannot be exactly the same. There will always be differences between depreciation and capital allowances. My hon. Friend mentioned other matters. This measure would take banks a step away from that, and for that reason I think that it is a mistake.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
My amendment is proposed on the basis that there should be symmetry of treatment between the Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. If the taxpayer must pay interest on outstanding tax, it is right that the Inland Revenue should pay interest on tax that is due to be repaid to the taxpayer. Generally, I favour equal treatment between taxpayers and the Inland Revenue. That is the object of the amendment and I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will not accept it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</ol></p></blockquote>
In his contribution to the previous debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) mentioned that the regulations that will be published under clause 66 have not appeared yet. The clause gives wide discretion to the Treasury on the contents of the regulations, which will, in due course, be subject to affirmative resolution. What is the likely content of the regulations? Will they be published in draft and be subject to consultation, so that those affected can comment on them? It would be right to include in the Bill some of the consideration that the Treasury have taken into account in framing the regulations. The amendment would provide for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I hope also to speak to the next set of amendments. There are two problems with this amendment.<br><br>
First, it would insert an attempted test of justice and reasonableness into the construction of the tax matrix, but does not specify who makes the decision about what is just and reasonable and checks whether, for example, it is subject to judicial review. Some unanswerable questions remain by asserting the need for being reasonable, but leaving hanging in the air how that will be policed within the system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was present when I spoke to the previous group of amendments, but I shall not repeat what I said then. Does he agree that every time a profit needs to be established, certain judgmental decisions must be made? They must made on the basis set out in the amendment: they must be just and reasonable, ultimately giving a true and fair view. One cannot get away from the necessity of making those judgmental decisions and that is true right across the board when establishing the profits of a bank or any other enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was here for the hon. Gentleman's entire, lengthy contribution to our deliberations and listened carefully to every word. I am aware of the point that he was making and am about to respond to another of his points.<br><br>
A number of extremely subjective judgments can be made about the prospects for recovering debt. A test of whether the judgment is just and reasonable seems an unpoliceable and vague way of conducting business.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) wants to use the amendment to tie the hands of the Revenue. He wants less discretion available to the Revenue and a more objective test. I see what the hon. Gentleman is after, but I am not sure that the phrase "just and reasonable" would achieve what he wishes.<br><br>
Secondly, the amendment may make it less attractive for banks to take advantage of the incentive which the Government have included in the proposed section 88c(3) set out in clause 66. I refer to the minor tax incentive to sell back debt to the debtor country. I am concerned about the impact of the amendment on that incentive because of the point made by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding that there is frequently a substantial difference between the amount of provision recommended under the Bank of England matrix and, presumably, under the tax matrix that will be established, and the secondary market price of the debt. The percentage difference between the value of debt implied by the Bank of England matrix and the secondary market price as at February this year was 17 per cent for Morocco, 10 per cent for Brazil, 30 per cent for Colombia, 26 per cent for Mexico, 14 per cent for the Philippines, 12 per cent for Algeria and 24 per cent for Venezuela. Therefore, there is a substantial difference, which varies dramatically from country to country, between what is down in the matrix and the secondary market price for the debt.<br><br>
The proposed tax regime which is designed to be an incentive to sell debt back to the Governments concerned is likely to be significant in impact only when the secondary market price of debt is significantly lower than the value of debt implied by the provision. It is only where the secondary market price is low that the incentive effect of the proposed section 88c(3) is likely to operate. Amendment No. 62, which aims to bowdlerise the tax matrix used to a certain extent, would reduce the incentive effect further and make it less advantageous for banks to take up the tax incentive in the new section 88c(3) and sell back the debt to the debtor country.<br><br>
Although I see what the hon. Gentleman means in attempting to introduce an objective, rather than a subjective, test, that attempt is flawed. Its consequences for sell-backs of debt would not be advantageous to the countries involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) suggested that the amendment would tie the Treasury's hands. That is not so. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beacons-field (Mr. Smith) noted, as yet we have nothing to go on. Although we have been told that the measure will be brought before Parliament at the appropriate time and be subject to affirmative resolution, the banks are uneasy at its arbitrariness. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has said that the matrix will be related to the current Bank of England matrix. Presumably that will remain for provisioning purposes and the new matrix will come in for the purposes of taxation relief. The amendment seeks to establish guidelines by which the matrix may be anchored. It states that the six conditions—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be taken into consideration".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is not mandatory, nor would it have the implications suggested by the hon. Gentleman. It would reassure the banks that they were not swimming around untethered to anything and that there was a principle to which the Revenue might refer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In answer to his second question, I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) that we intend to publish a draft for consultation. When the regulations are brought before the House they will be subject to the affirmative procedure, so that the House can decide whether they are fair and reasonable.<br><br>
I can also answer my hon. Friend's first and third questions. The intention is to follow the Bank of England matrix closely, omitting only a couple of factors which, because they depend on purely subjective inputs, would be inappropriate in a legal matrix such as this. As far as possible, the aim is to remove subjectivity from the process and to render the outcome certain. The impact of my hon. Friend's amendment would be to reintroduce uncertainty. One could not be sure of the legal interpretation of the matrix, nor of its justice and reasonableness.<br><br>
I can also tell my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) that it is not so much a question of tying the Treasury's hands, but of untying the hands of the judges by making the matter justiciable. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was worried about that aspect and recognised, rightly, that the effect of the amendment—which I regard as more of a probing amendment than a substantive change—would be to reintroduce uncertainty. Therefore I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured that the regulations that we produce will satisfy him and the spirit of the criteria that he has outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that. I was surprised by the objection of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) to the inclusion in the Bill of the concepts of justice and reasonableness. Only the other day, in our discussion of one of his amendments to the clause that deals with EEIGs, he wanted the concept of reasonableness to be introduced. I too, was keen on the idea then.<br><br>
I understand why my hon. Friend does not want the courts to get caught up in the matter, although I am slightly uneasy that he is not confident that the regulations will be just and reasonable. I should have expected him to be more confident in that regard, but what he said was helpful and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As an accountant, this is perhaps the part of the Bill about which I feel most strongly. It does not provide for a bad debt, but states that the money is lost and that tax relief cannot be obtained in the year that the debt was incurred. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) talked about the integrity of the tax system. This section of the Bill is an unfortunate departure from that. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will say that the same considerations apply and that relief must be phased, but an important issue of principle is involved. If one incurs a bad debt, there are no revisions or matrices
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
and it is not subject to judgment—one has simply lost money and incurred a bad debt. One should be allowed to retrieve the whole amount in the year that the debt was incurred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall pick up the final comment of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). In many cases, although the banks have incurred a bad debt in their own accounts and lost money, they have not forgiven the debt to the Third world country. That is a major problem of the tax treatment of commercial banks in Britain in connection with third world debt. We shall probably return to that issue in more detail on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
I wish to draw attention to amendments Nos, 195, 191, 192, 193 and 196, which were tabled by the Opposition. They seek to widen the small encouragement given by the clause to commercial banks to write off debt. Let us remember the scale of the debt crisis faced by the developing world. Between 1982-89, the net transfer of resources—new loans less debt service—from debtor countries to the developed northern creditor countries, amounted to $202 billion. That is a net flow of funds over seven years from the poor world to the rich world. It illustrates the extent of the debt problem faced by the globe.<br><br>
The impact of the debt burden on the economies and peoples of the third world is clear: its result is enormous poverty, malnutrition and underdevelopment. Until the end of the 1970s, reasonable progress in health care, education and life expectancy was made in most developing countries. From the beginning of the 1980s onwards, that progress was reversed. In many parts of the third world, we can witness a decline in standards of education, health, nutrition and welfare. The turning point from improving to declining standards was the time when the debt crisis began to hit. There are any number of examples that show the extent of the problem with which the debt crisis is burdening the third world.<br><br>
In Latin America and the Caribbean, between 1980 and 1985, the proportion of people suffering from poverty increased from 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the population. In absolute terms, the number of people in poverty increased from 130 million to 163 million. In most of Africa and much of Latin America, average incomes fell by 10 to 25 per cent in the 1980s.<br><br>
Over the past few years, in the 37 poorest nations, spending on health has been reduced by 50 per cent and on education by 25 per cent. In almost half of the 103 developing countries for which recent information is available, the proportion of six to 11-year-olds enrolled in primary schools is falling.<br><br>
I could give country by country examples of how the debt crisis affects poverty and need in the third world, but I shall content myself with two. In Ghana, between 1980 and 1985, the period when the debt crisis was hitting, the infant mortality rate increased by 40 per cent. In Zambia, the child death rate due to malnutrition has more than doubled since 1980. Those are the results of the debt crisis as they affect people in the third world.<br><br>
I disagree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield when he says that the solution to the debt problem does
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
not lie in the United Kingdom's corporation tax system. The whole solution does not lie there, but we should at least examine how our corporation tax system operates and how it could be used to alleviate the problems of hunger and of a lack of education and health care in the third world. We in this Committee can use the tax system to assist.<br><br>
The Government have taken a small step in that direction with clause 66. Our amendments seek to go further. They have three purposes. First, they would not only give a tax incentive for sales of debt at a reduced rate back to the debtor country's Government, but would make it possible to reduce debt interest. That is debt servicing reduction rather than debt reduction. It was included in the Brady initiative which was launched by the United States a year and half ago. It was a limited initiative which sought to reduce overall indebtedness by a maximum of 20 per cent, but it was useful in two ways. First, it called for concerted action, marrying the actions of commercial banks. Governments and international organisations, which is welcome. It also included debt reduction and debt servicing reduction rather than simply rescheduling or new loan making. That, too, was an extremely welcome part of the initiative. The amendment would make debt service reduction eligible for tax relief and would provide the necessary incentive.<br><br>
It is not possible that the present tax system allows tax relief in such circumstances, but the existing legislation is not clear. The amendment would clarify the matter. We want debt interest reductions to qualify for tax relief in the same way as actual debt reduction under the provisions of section 88C(3).<br><br>
The second purpose of the amendments is to encourage outright donations for debt. From our reading of existing tax law, that may qualify for tax relief, but we wish to ensure that it is covered belt and braces by the clause.<br><br>
Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, we want to ensure that debt for development and debt for environment swaps which involve charitable voluntary bodies and international organisations also become eligible for tax relief. Debt for development swaps are becoming a major way in which commercial banks and voluntary aid organisations use debt reduction to benefit the countries concerned. Several advantages are available to a bank that does a debt for development or debt for environment swap. In most cases the commercial bank donates a part of its developing country exposure to a charity. The charity has a special arrangement with the developing country to get the debt, or part of it, serviced in local currency rather than in dollars or in sterling. The local cash is used by the charity concerned to fund priority development projects in the developing country.<br><br>
Such an arrangement has several advantages. First, a bank saves on the expense and administration of servicing its own debt portfolio. Secondly, the bank benefits from the substantial amount of goodwill that is generated by such a donation of debt to a charitable body. Thirdly, the bank knows that the debt forgiveness that it undertakes goes directly to support development projects in the country concerned.<br><br>
The first debt for development swap of which we are aware was made in February 1988 by the Fleet Norstar
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
financial group in Providence, Rhode Island. It involved a debt for Costa Rica of £250,000. The arrangement was made to assist a conservation effort in Costa Rica. The debts were donated to Nature Conservancy, an environmental charity based in Washington. The charity then swapped the debt for bonds issued by the Costa Rican Government and the bonds were used to finance conservation efforts in a 25,000 jungle habitat in Costa Rica. The key factor of that arrangement was that under the United States internal revenue service ruling made in November 1987 that donation was tax deductible because it was a charitable donation.<br><br>
The second reported similar debt donation was made by the American Express bank which gave £1 million in Nigerian obligations to the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help. That institution is using the funds as part of programme to fight hunger, health problems, unemployment and illiteracy in Nigeria. The internal revenue service tax rules allowed that donation to receive tax relief.<br><br>
As far as I am aware, the only donation made in the same way by a British bank was that made in December 1988 by the Midland bank when it handed over its total loan exposure in the Sudan, which amounted to some US£800,000, to the United Nations Children's Fund. In return for that donation, UNICEF simultaneously arranged for the Sudanese Government to service programmes in local currency. The Bank of Sudan is paying UNICEF local currency and the funds are being invested solely in water, sanitation, reforestation and health education programmes in the Kordofan region of the Sudan which are being administered by UNICEF. UNICEF assumes accountability for the use of the funds and the Sudanese Government have co-operated fully throughout with UNICEF to establish the programmes and to assist in their implementation.<br><br>
Those examples show how a debt for development or debt for environment swap operates. The debt is donated to an organisation, such as UNICEF, by the bank to which it is owed. That organisation then makes an agreement with the debtor nation to service and fund excellent development projects in the relevant country for the equivalent amount in local currency. Such arrangements should be encouraged by the United Kingdom taxation system. There is a complicated mechanism whereby some tax relief may be available for a bank undertaking such a development swap. As far as I understand it, the Midland bank did not receive tax relief for the arrangement that it made with UNICEF. Banks can receive relief when they undertake such swaps, but within strict parameters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How did the Midland bank treat that debt in its books? Once it gave the debt away the debt was incapable of being realised, so it must have written the debt off, in which case it would have received full tax relief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman identifies the problem of the matrix. If the Midland bank was not provisioned up to the full amount of matrix, the hon. Gentleman's point would stand, but if the Midland bank was provisioned at or above the level of the matrix—which I believe it is—the point would not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
stand, because the bank would not be allowed in the year that the debt occurred to obtain relief on the extra amount beyond its existing provision represented by the donation.<br><br>
Under section 339 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, it is possible for a bank in some circumstances to obtain additional relief. However, because the amount is a charitable donation rather than a provision against third world losses, relief is available only if the bank's total donations are 3 per cent or less of the dividends paid in the year. If, as I hope, development swaps take off as a mechanism for debt reduction and for development assistance in the third world, that provision of a 3 per cent ceiling would be prohibited.<br><br>
Our three amendments would encourage additional debt relief for the economies and peoples of the third world. It seems that the Government are taking some small steps in the clause, but those go nowhere near far enough. The Government's provision for sale of debt back to the debtor nation is unlikely to be taken up extensively because of the lack of a real incentive in the case of many developing countries for the banks to do so.<br><br>
Our amendments would make improvements and encourage further debt relief. They would enable parts of the Brady package of initiatives to be undertaken and outright debt donations to take place with full additional tax relief above the matrix figure. They would enable debt for development and debt for environment swaps to occur, again above the matrix figure—the point made by the hon. Member for Bea-consfield is important—with full tax relief. All those three developments are desirable. They would assist in a small way in ensuring that in the third world struggling under enormous burdens of poverty, disease, malnutrition, lack of proper health care and education, could benefit to a certain extent from our deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carrington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My concern about this provision in clause 66 is the effect that it might have on the existence of the secondary debt market itself. I accept that the reason why most banks would sell debt into that market would not be tax driven, but driven by other considerations to do with their balance sheets and their perception of the effect that retaining that debt would have on their financial standing.<br><br>
Tax effects discourage banks from selling debt into the secondary market, which may well reduce the attraction for those banks to act in the secondary market. That in itself is not good. The secondary market has benefits worthy of encouragement rather than discouragement. There are frequently good reasons why banks would wish to trade their third world debts. One reason is that banks other than the very large ones are geographically centralised and their debt tends to concentrate in one part of the world. The secondary market is useful for banks to get a more balanced portfolio of third world debt by swapping debt in one part of the world for debt in another. Spreading the risk has been good from the point of view of bank balance sheets, and should be encouraged.<br><br>
The other reason for keeping the secondary market going is that it has produced some cheap prices on third
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
world debt, of which the debtor countries have been able to avail themselves. They have been able to buy back debt at a much lower price than they would have been able to under the rescheduling arrangements. Consequently, the secondary market has provided a way outside normal rescheduling arrangements by which debtor countries can reduce their debt and buy it back, at prices cheaper than they would otherwise have been able to negotiate with all their bank creditors. That has been good for the debtor countries, and is a reason for keeping the secondary market. Under many of the rescheduling arrangements it is difficult for a bank to sell the debt directly to the debtor country. The secondary market has been able to get round that to some extent, therefore has been beneficial to both sides in the transaction.<br><br>
I am worried that the tax change may damage the secondary market. Although I believe that the changes will be secondary in the sense that the market is not necessarily tax driven, I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would monitor the effect of the provision on the secondary market and introduce any changes necessary to ensure that the effect is not bad. We all want to encourage the retiring of as much Third world debt as possible. It is in the interests not only of Third world countries, but of the lending banks to get that debt out of the way so that everybody can start lending again to those countries, but in a way that will not repeat the mistakes of the past.</span></p>
<p>Several hon. Members rose—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I mention that as it is nearly 7.30 pm, I propose to allow the debate to continue until 8 o'clock. If there is no motion to adjourn the proceedings at 8 o'clock, I shall suspend the sitting for two hours for dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The evening wears on and I am reluctant to detain the committee. None the less, I must point out that Opposition Members do not argue for tax regulation that would penalise banks for past lending, however unwise. We encourage tax regulation which would encourage debt reduction. The reasons for that have been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). Millions of people in the third world are affected by the burden of repaying debt. Furthermore, what was a debt problem is now becoming a growth problem.<br><br>
A few weeks ago I was in Jamaica when the Parliament there was debating its Budget. At present, 40 cents of every dollar that Jamaica earns is spent on servicing debts to commercial and official sources, it is impossible for third world countries in the Caribbean, central America and sub-Saharan Africa to help themselves to achieve any level of economic growth when they are carrying such a crippling burden of debt.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) spoke of sensible right-wing solutions to debt problems. I put it to him that under current conditions, only two regimes have been successful in paying back their debts. One of them was the regime of the Ceaucescu in Romania and the other was that of General Pinochet in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
Chile. Only the most vicious and repressive right-wing dictatorships can be successful in repaying debt under the present system. Are those the sensible, right-wing solutions that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield was impressing on us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should extend her list of countries that have repaid or are repaying debt to include the democratic Commonwealth country of Botswana which has, by following sound economic and fiscal policies, significantly repaid debt over the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. Those few countries that have been successful in repaying debt under the current system have the most appalling political set-ups.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Lady hear what I said? I referred to the independent democratic Commonwealth country of Botswana.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must genuinely apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I am aware of the different consultancies that he has for different countries and I assumed that he was speaking of one of the countries for which he does a lot of work in this House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no consultancy in Botswana or any adjacent country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that if one were to consult the Register of Members' interests, one would find that the hon. Gentleman has a connection with a country which claims to be independent but is, in fact, a protectorate of South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That simply is not the case. I am cetainly involved in business in the independent Commonwealth country of Botswana. I have no business connections whatever with any other country to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I have made an error it was a genuine one and I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. My point is that it is virtually impossible, without the most appalling repression of the population, to pay back debt under the present regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that Brazil was about to repay its debt. I said that it was considering commonsense solutions to solving the debt problem, for example, by converting the debt. I did not suggest that Brazil would repay its debt as, clearly, it is not in a position to do so.</span></p>
<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whenever bankers and accountants talk about commonsense solutions to solving debt, the solutions almost always involve lowering the living standards of the population.<br><br>
An aspect of the debt problem that Conservative Members, who are so anxious to act as apologists for bankers, have ignored is that it has contributed in no small measure to ecological problems. It is no accident
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
that the top six debtor countries also have 60 per cent of our rain forests. At the present rate of exploitation, tropical rain forests will disappear in nine years. If we wish to save the tropical rain forests, we must do something to relieve the countries involved of the debt burden that is forcing them to mortgage our ecological heritage.<br><br>
Conservative Members, including the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) ignore the fact that economies, such as that of Jamaica, which pays 40 cents on the dollar to service debt, become distorted. One third of Bolivia's economy, for example, is illegal, involving the drug trade. With the increasing burden of debt repayment in the third world, has come the growth of black economies fuelled by trade in cocaine and other illegal drugs. If Conservative Members are worried about drugs and want to know what can be done about the drugs trade, they should remove the burden of debt repayment from countries in central America and the Caribbean.<br><br>
This is a vital subject for the future of the world and its environment and for trade and relations betwen countries in every part of the world. The sensible, right-wing solutions that Conservative Members talk about involve terrible poverty and suffering for the populations—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is talking rubbish. President Collor de Mello was elected because he proposed radical solutions to tackle the terrible inflation in Brazil which has caused problems for the poorest people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to debate the internal politics of Brazil—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be a bad idea, especially at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter is serious. There are no immediate solutions to the problem. The Brady plan will help only the Philippines and Mexico. It is a problem for Governments. Part of the problem faced by indebted countries is interest rates, which are entirely the responsibility of the G7 countries and the United States. Another part of their problem is the activities of commercial banks, which are regulated by Governments.<br><br>
In indebted countries, commercial debt is becoming official sector debt. Contrary to what the bankers want us to believe, the debt crisis is not over for the populations of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and central America. The responsibility lies with Governments. The United States Government have acknowledged the responsibility of Governments to tackle the debt problem, but the Financial Secretary seems to shrug that off. The way forward is not endless rescheduling of debt so that countries have to pay the interest on loans, but debt servicing and ultimately debt reduction.<br><br>

debt so that countries have to pay the interest on loans, but debt servicing and ultimately debt reduction.<br><br>
I agree with Conservative Members who have said that the problem is debt reduction in the commercial sector and in the official sector. I am detaining the Committee, perhaps to the irritation of Conservative Members, but I believe that the way forward for the third world is not commercial bank loans filling the pockets of bankers, or aid; the answer is self-generated growth. I know from my work on the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee and from the experience of my relatives in the Caribbean and the third world that there is no possibility of growth for the third world when it has this ridiculous and crushing burden of debt. We look forward to a time when Ministers and Treasury officials take seriously their responsibilities to encourage the banks, through the tax framework, to adopt serious debt reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have got Botswana out of the opprobrium, to which it was not entitled, thanks to the apology of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stock Newington (Ms. Abbott). Botswana has a consistent and, I believe, an unrivalled record of democracy in Africa. No other country there has such a consistent record of democratic Government and that should be put on record.<br><br>
I am puzzled by part of the hon. Lady's argument. She seems to assume that if a country is succeeding in repaying debt, it must, almost by definition, be engaged in right-wing solutions. It is not terribly helpful to call them right-wing or left-wing. If a country can organise its economy to relieve some of the dead weight of bureaucracy which overwhelms the economies of several developing countries, and can remove the stifling of initiative, which has happened in so many developing countries such as those in eastern Europe, usually it can significantly improve its economic performance. However, by those means alone it cannot escape from its debts. To do so requires assistance from the developed countries. Those solutions are not by definition, right-wing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Abbott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He did not have the pleasure that I had of travelling to Washington and New York to talk to the aid agencies and banks about the debt problem. Had he done so, he would have realised that few countries are being successful in repaying their debts. The only ones being helped by the Brady plan are Mexico and the Philipines because America has put special foreign policy pressure on the banks in that respect. The countries that have succeeded in substantial debt reduction have hitherto done so only by seriously oppressing their populations. Others have rescheduled and rescheduled and are at least keeping up the payments. No others are achieving substantial debt reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was heartbroken that I could not go to Washington and New York with the hon. Lady. I had been looking forward to it for many weeks beforehand. Only the intervention of disastrous economic events at home, on which it seemed worthwhile to comment on behalf of my party, prevented me from enjoying that wonderful trip. However, I read the report, which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
hon. Lady did not vote against, which makes clear not only the point that she has just made, but some of my arguments about the economies of those countries. I do not claim that most of those countries will be able to repay their debts if they improve their economic performance as I described. It will take more than that. In virtually all cases, it will require measures of debt foregiveness—. I do no like the term "forgiveness" because of its moral content. Governments will have to write off some of the debts of those countries to solve the problem.<br><br>
I support the amendments, especially Nos. 191, 192 and 193, which appear to open the way to a wider variety of means to encourage banks to participate in this process. In some cases, banks would be given more immediate tax relief if, for example, they sold debt at a discount—at a lower rate—to a development agency and thus participated in a process which enabled the development agency directly to assist a particular country. That and the other examples given by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), which I shall not repeat, all seem useful contributions to the process which the Government might welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) said that no country which had got into severe debt problems in the 1970s had subsequently been able to repay its debts under a democracy. She forgot, of course, the singular example of the United Kingdom which has successfully done so.
Amendment No. 64, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), highlights a concern of the banks about the treatment of realised bad debts. I think that he is right that it is the banks most serious worry, which I understand and about which I have spoken to them.<br><br>
Whether a debt becomes bad is outside a banker's control when he has made the loan. Whether he chooses to realise that debt here and now is a matter of choice—by selling the debt. That introduces a different perspective. Furthermore, if we phased the tax relief on unrealised losses but not on realised losses, we would create an artificial incentive for people to realise their losses and obtain full relief immediately. The net effect on the Treasury would potentially be a far greater loss of tax revenues in the short term.<br><br>
There is also a potential tax loophole in that it would be possible for banks to rearrange their debt within their group and realise it by sales to affiliates and so on, which would make matters ever worse. We could introduce avoidance measures to prevent that but, inevitably, such measures would have to be extensive in scope, dealing with worldwide banking groups, and giving us extra-territorial international information powers of the sort that would burden the Committee with extensive legislation of the sort that it would find especially offensive—as we found when dealing with EEIGs and no doubt will again when we reach clause 78 some time towards Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My amendments Nos. 66 and 65 were designed to deal with the inventions that the hon. Gentlemen mentioned.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that they would not. because it would not provide draconian powers nor, I am sure, would my hon. Friend wish to give us them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury raised the alarming prospect of returning to the subject on the Floor of the House in greater detail. Does he realise how many of my hon. Friends who are not members of the Committee are also bankers?<br><br>
Banks will receive debt relief for a debt reduction that is made for commercial reasons under normal commercial law. It will be given without phasing if the debt is sold back to the debtor country. Under the Brady plan for Mexico, that was done in a way that would ensure relief.<br><br>
If the relinquishment of debt to the debtor country is made for charitable reasons, under charitable law it is possible for the banks also to get relief. Gifts in kind are not deductible, but it is possible for them to arrange a transfer of money that will extinguish the debt and achieve the effect, and full charitable relief will be available to the banks. The aims of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury would be achieved by the clause as drafted. I entirely sympathise with his objective, I welcome his proposals for the greater extinguishment of debt.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was anxious about the 3 per cent limit. I do not envisage the charitable relinquishment of debt happening on a scale that would impinge upon that limit, but if it does we shall re-examine the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asserted that if, say, a bank made a 50 per cent provision on a debt as required by the matrix, and then sold it for 30p in the pound, it would not get relief on the extra 20 per cent. It would get the extra relief. It would be phased unless it were a relinquishment back to the debtor—the hypothetical circumstance that the hon. Gentleman suggested. There is nothing for him to worry about there.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) expressed anxiety about the potential damage of clause 66 to the secondary market. No such damage will occur: all the clause would do is phase losses. It would not deny relief. It is unlikely that the secondary market would be significantly affected. Firms which deal in the debt would not be caught by the provisions unless they tried to use them as a loophole for avoidance. One of the amendments deals with that problem as an anti-avoidance measure.<br><br>
I hope therefore that the Opposition amendment will be withdrawn because we have achieved what it wants in the Bill.</span></p>
<p>7.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for confirming clearly two points that our amendments sought to clarify. First, that debt service reduction by reducing the rate of interest on an existing debt, as well as actual debt reduction, will qualify for tax relief. That confirmation is welcome. Secondly, that outright debt donation is also covered by existing tax relief. That is also welcome.<br><br>
However, I confess that we retain a disagreement about debt for development and environment swaps
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
via charities and international bodies. We believe that the 3 per cent rule is likely to be a hindrance and that the complexities of existing charity law and availing tax relief via charity law could be clarified and provided as a better incentive for commercial banks if something akin to amendment No. 193, coupled with amendment No. 196, were to be adopted.<br><br>
In view of the value of such development swaps and the needs that exist in the Third world, the Financial Secretary's response has not been satisfactory and I give notice that we shall press amendment No. 193 to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) must now decide whether he wishes to press or withdraw his amendment. We shall then take the others in turn formally starting with the Government amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly reply to what my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said. I thought that his speech contained a classic example of Inland Revenue logic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very flattered by that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He said that we must have a deferral of the relief for realised losses so that people do not realise their losses and lose the revenue. In fact, that has nothing to do with principles or merits, it is a straightforward anti-avoidance device and I understand that the Inland Revenue always looks for that. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee I believe that it is the Inland Revenue's job to protect the total amount that is collected. I understand why that point has been included, but it is offensive in principle.</span></p>

CONTRIBUTIONS TO LOCAL ENTERPRISE AGENCIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 67 is deceptively short. It extends the qualifying period for tax relief for contributions to approved local enterprise agencies for three years, from April 1992 to April 1995. That is a logical step, given that clause 68 provides tax relief for business contributions to training and enterprise councils. To continue the tax relief on business contributions to local enterprise agencies is in tune with that philosophy. Local enterprise agencies are advice shops, established to provide information on starting small businesses. As such, they are entirely worthy and valuable bodies. They will provide all sorts of advice. They have tended to concentrate on property advice rather than on other forms of advice, but that is a mild criticism. Local enterprise agencies have done much that is to be welcomed.<br><br>
The general rule for deciding whether any tax concession is welcome must rest on whether the benefit to be gained is worth the cost to the Exchequer.<br><br>
We have to promote small business. Many people have splendid ideas about the complexities of setting up a business, and they need assistance. We must continue to offer incentives to ensure that local enterprise agencies can be established and carry forward their work for the next three years. We do not therefore object to the proposal.<br><br>
What do the Government envisage that the measure will cost? I imagine that it is negligible, but we should like the Minister to confirm that. As a basic principle, we do not oppose the extension of relief for those bodies for three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) welcomes the clause. The cost will obviously depend on the generosity of the companies making contributions. Independent sources suggest that about 5,000 companies

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
support local enterprise agencies and that about £15 million is given by the private sector each year. That will obviously result in a corresponding reduction in tax revenue, depending on the tax rates of the companies concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are providing incentives to business to help local small business to be established. When local authorities do the same, and establish mechanisms for supporting local small business, will the Government consider exempting that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
expenditure when considering poll-tax capping those local authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities are already exempt from corporation tax. 1 shall not detain the Committee further by elaborating on such a simple clause.</span></p>
