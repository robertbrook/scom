	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 771, in page 43, line 40, leave out from beginning to line 7 on page 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that we have tabled to clause 44 are designed to probe the Government's thinking. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Health will consider that when he makes his response. The clause is frightening in many ways, because at first sight it gives the Secretary of State many powers, which hitherto no one had envisaged, not over only community care, with which the clause deals, but over a much wider range of social services. We want to use the amendments to discover precisely how the Secretary of State for Health intends to use those major powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the notes on clauses, the Government say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this clause enables the Secretary of State to issue directions to local authorities covering all their social service functions".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we do not exaggerate when we say that, if that happens, it will represent a major development in the relationship between the Secretary of State and his successors and local authorities and those involved with community care in a wider sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary tell us the precise directions that the Secretary of State has in mind? Will he respond to the view that the clause seems far too wide, and gives far too many powers to the Secretary of State? That opinion is widely held, not only by my hon. Friends, but by many voluntary and professional organisations and local authority associations. Those associations hope that the grey areas of community care, where the demarcation lines are not clear between them and the Secretary of State, will be clarified today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not dispute the right of the Secretary of State to offer guidance. Indeed, in last week's debate on Scotland our criticism of the Secretary of States was that he was not giving guidance to Scotland. WScte should have liked the Secretary of State for Scotland to be more involved. Our reason for tabling the amendment is that the Secretary of State's powers will be too wide ranging. It is not an exaggeration to say that they will be sweeping new powers over many aspects of social services, including those for children, which many hon. Members feel have been adequately
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1082</span>
dealt with by the Children Act 1989. Enormous thought went into that Act. To be fair, I should say that the then Minister for Health, the hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor) extensively involved both sides of the Committee, as well as voluntary and professional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must from time to time think about how local authorities will interpret the Bill. It is odd that the Bill which will give sweeping powers to the Secretary of State to deal with children, assessments and so on, will apply in addition to the Children Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that last Monday during the debate in the House on legal services, the Attorney-General said that the Children Act governed the law as it related to children, and that no further amendments or changes would be made until the rolling programme to establish a family court had been worked out? That was also made clear when the Children Bill was discussed in Committee. Clause 44 is an attempt to subvert the good work that was done to codify the law on children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an excellent point. He is in a strong position to do so because he was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Children Bill, and he has great knowledge of and interest in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will give the Secretary of State various powers, including the power to direct local authorities in matters relating to children. That leads to the question of how those powers have found their way into the Bill. Why were such powers not discussed when previous legislation, including the Children Bill, was debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many are worried that the Secretary of State will assume these powers almost by the back door. Mr. Ken Judge, the director of the King's Fund, was quoted in 	<i>Social Work Today</i> on 30 November 1989:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This particular Bill goes further down the road in promoting vague enabling powers which concentrate power in the hands of the Secretary of State without much chance of Parliamentary review. These potentially Draconian powers are there to give a clear indication to local authorities not to thwart the basic thrust of Government policy."</p></blockquote>
If Mr. Judge is right, Opposition Members should be very worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that co-operation is important in community care, and the Minister's contributions in Committee have shown that he shares that view. But the Government are departing from that by giving the present Secretary of State and his successors powers that have been described as draconian by a man who, judged by his utterances, is reasonable in his views. It is important, therefore, to ask the questions implied in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that it would be helpful if the Minister were to give examples of circumstances under which the powers could be used. I envisaged that the Secretary of State will direct local authorities when they fall down on their statutory duties, or fail to fulfil
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1083</span>
their obligations in law. I am worried about the fact that there are usually sound reasons why local authorities fall down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A current anxiety throughout the country, and especially in London, is about the huge shortage of social workers. Vast numbers of child care cases are unallocated to social workers, for the simple reason that there are not enough social workers. In Yorkshire, for example, there is huge competition to recruit scarce social workers. Humberside county council recently offered £2,000 to recruit social workers coming off training courses, because the council had been criticised for its lack of appropriate action in some child care cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend agree that directions may be given, but that the central problem is lack of support and resourcing from the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. friend is right. He speaks with enormous experience because he has been a distinguished social worker. The Committee has benefited from his experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is to be agreed unamended, we have to consider its practical implications. They are as my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) has just described. The Secretary of State will have the power to issue directions about child care, assessment, and other matters. That is more power than the Committee would wish to give to any Secretary of State. The Minister and the Government should therefore clarify why they need to take such power upon themselves. They seem to be attempting to gain them under the guise of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people feel that the Bill is the most important of the decade; indeed, it will take us into the next decade. Therefore, the Government should explain their view of the role of all the parties that will be involved in community care, including that of local authorities, voluntary organisations, carers, the users and consumers. The Government should also explain the important role of the physically disabled, for some people feel that we have not given sufficient priority to them. They have an important part to play in drawing up plans for dealing with community care into the 1990s and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Opposition look forward to the Minister's reply, he ought to know that there are many people who inspect that in the clause the Government will continue to diminish the role of local councils. We shall find it rather sad if the Government do that, because we believe that social work committees in Scotland, which are elected, have an incentive to keep in touch with their electorate and their community. It is important that a gap does not develop in community care between the social services committees and the people whom they have been elected to represent. The Government have already diminished the role of local councils on health boards, as we saw earlier in the parts of the Bill that deal with the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have had a dogmatic dislike of the role of local authorities. I hope that they will not seek in the clause to diminish the role of local authorities further by giving the Secretary of State the power to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1084</span>
intervene without being subject to the discipline of a parliamentary review. That accountability is essential, and we have tabled amendments to the clause because we feel that it is missing. I hope that the Minister will see the importance of that, and will respond to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will surprise many people if it stands unamended. The main thrust of this part of the Bill arose from the Griffiths report. We have not identified anything in the report that would lead the Government, the Committee or the House to give the Secretary of State such draconian powers, as Mr. Judge described them. If there is nothing in Griffiths, it would be interesting to hear from the Under-Secretary what gave rise to the idea. There was little about it in the White Paper although the Under-Secretary might argue that the notes on clauses, which are our main guide to the Government's thinking, imply that the power will be used sparingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are bound to suspect any measure that gives power to the Secretary of State to make directions to local authorities, to social services departments, and so on, with a simple assurance that it will be used sparingly. If the Bill is enacted, the power will be there. It is an important power, which the Secretary of State will be free to use, however the Government describe their intentions in the notes on clauses. No court will refer to notes on clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about the clause, as later amendments will show and we hope that the Minister's reply to amendment No. 771 will help us understand why Ministers feel that the Secretary of State should take such strong powers of interference and direction. We feel, and Griffiths seems to feel, that the essential thing in making community care work is co-operation among all the parties involved: the Government, local authorities users, carers and so on. Co-operation is community care with drive. We cannot impose upon people something that they have not discussed, and expect them to make it work if there is no community involvement, which is essential to making community care a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of an explanation from the Minister in response to the amendment, we shall be left with a whiff of suspicion that the Government believe that the person in Whitehall knows best. We do not agree. On the evidence of the Accounts Commission report on what it considers to be the chaos of community care, of the Griffiths analysis of the problem and of our knowledge of our constituencies, nothing leads us to believe that the person in Whitehall knows best. Nothing convinces us that the Secretary of State for Health and his successors will know best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we are reluctant to give a blank check to the Secretary of State and his successors, we have tabled the amendment to give the Under-Secretary the opportunity to explain the Government's position. In that spirit I ask the Committee to consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) phrased his remarks in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1085</span>
terms of probing the Government's thinking, and the amendment is designed to clarify the Government's intentions. I accept his remarks in that spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government accept the right of hon. Members and of the Committee to question the power of the Executive to make directions that are not subject to the negative resolution procedure or to the approval of Parliament. By definition, directions are different from orders and regulations, which are dealt with in clause 58, and they are not subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general tenor of the hon. Gentleman's argument, with which I agree in the sense of relying on and placing great responsibilities on local authorities, is likely to be at odds with the arguments that some of his hon. Friends may well use on a subsequent amendment on the issue of ringfencing. I accept the general thrust of the hon. Gentleman's comments that we should work with, properly co-ordinate with, consult and trust local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will probably find that when we come to those later arguments our view in consistent. It is essential to have co-operation between the Secretary of State, the local authorities and others. As for ringfencing, we argue that the Secretary of State and the local authorities should agree between them the funding that is necessary and that such money should not be spent for any purpose other than community care. That would arise from agreement, but if the Secretary of State were given powers of further direction, there might be a move away from the principle of ringfencing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not stretch your tolerance, Dame Janet, because I suspect that we shall return to this argument before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I clarify the Government's reasoning for the proposed new section and also distinguish between general and specific directions. I shall deal first with general directions and make four points in response to the comments of the hon. Member for Monklands, West. The hon. Gentleman asked for examples. General directions would follow from what my hon. Friend the Minister for Health said in earlier sittings about care plans and assessment procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of general directions could relate to how we should expect local authorities to prepare progrmames of care in the community by social services deprtments. That would cover how they should consult, draw up plans and the extent of such plans, the assessment procedures to be followed, who should be consulted and who else should be involved in assessing the care needs of, for example, frail elderly people who may or may not be able to continue living in their own homes. Those are two clear examples of general directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, unlike specific directions, general directions do not introduce any new principle. The hon. Gentleman will know that under sections 21 and 29 of the National Assistance Act 1948, passed under a Labour Government, the Executive have powers of general direction. There are also powers of general
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1086</span>
direction under section 45 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968. There is nothing new in principle in giving the Executive a power to describe, by direction, what is required of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point is an assurance for the hon. Gentleman. Although he did not specifically say so, I suspect that some of his anxiety is that, by general direction, the Secretary of State might somehow prejudice local authorities' activities in providing local authority residential accommodation. He did not say that, but that may well be the worry of some of hon. Friends. However, by direction, the Secretary of State cannnot upset the purpose of primary legislation and therefore the principles of clause 37, which call for mixed care for the elderly in local authority residential accommodation and, in the independent sector, voluntary and private sector accommodation. That principle is enshrined in legislation and there is no way in which a Secretary of State in the present Administration could jeopadise it. Similarly, a Secretary of State in another Government, who might approach the issue in a different way, could not prejudice the provision of independent sector accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister ponder on the possibility of a local authority failing to fulfil the wish of the Government to stimulate the private sector because it does not think that the private sector in the area offers what the clients need? If the private sector offers only institutional care, as it usually does, and the local authority thinks that domiciliary provision is required, would the Secretary of State intervene on the basis that the local authority is not pursuing the Government's philosophy of stimulating the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman poses a difficult hypothetical question. I cannot avoid it because it is germane to our discussion. Clearly, the Secretary of State will wish to place great responsibility upon local authorities to decide their own balance of care within the general principles of what I have described as a mixed economy of care, although that is perhaps not an appropriate description. At the end of the day, the local authority must make its own decision. If a local authority goes to an extreme in either direction by having only local authority accommodation or only independent sector accommodation, that raises the question of whether it is fulfilling the principles of clause 37. In such a case the Secretary of State would be concerned. I shall come in a moment to the specific directional powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point about general directions is how they would be drawn up. I assure the Committee that, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Health said earlier, we shall prepare draft guidelines on how to draw up a care plan and make an assessment. We shall then consult the local authority associations and the British Association of Social Workers and others to ensure that the guidelines are workable and sensible and in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Act. When we have consulted, we shall issue the guidelines in the form of general directions. The purpose of the power is to give the guidelines, after proper consultation and co-ordination, the effective force tht they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1087</span>
I admit that the specific directions break new ground because the Secretary of State does not have the specific power at the moment to make directions concerning a home, for example, or an authority. He has only general powers in relation to the statutes that I have cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make three points in relation to the specific powers. First, as the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) knows, the social services inspectorate within the Department of Health might make a report on a local authority and its range of services. However, once it has produced its report, that is the end of the matter. The Secretary of State has no powers to follow it up and say that responsibilities under statute are not being discharged. Neither, when there is a scandal or an abuse of power, does the Secretary of State have power to set up inquiries himself and follow them with directions. It is entirely the responsibility of the local authority involved. I shall not dwell on examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows of many authorities of different political hues. The local authority, sometimes with encouragement from central Government, is responsible for setting up an inquiry and putting its own house in order. It is important to complete the legislative circle and to give the Secretary of State powers to make specific directions. The hon. Member for Monklands, West did not refer to sections 7B or 7C, which are related. Section 7B gives the Secretary of State power to set up inquiries, which is new, and section 7C gives him power to make specific directions in the event of defualt. Sections 7A, 7B and 7C have to be read together. It would be illogical to have sections 7B and 7C without having the power to follow up the consequences of inquiries and defaults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman (Peckaham)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To justify the Committee giving extra power to the Secretary of State, the Minister mentioned that the social services inspectorate can liaise with the local authority and make a report to the Secretary of State but cannot enforce its findings or insist that the local authority takes any action. Will the Minister give the Committee chapter and verse of examples of when the social services inspectorate has made recommendations and reported its findings to the Secretary of State and the local authority has dug in and refused to act on those recommendations? He must show that the Secretary of State's powers have not been adequate to justify giving him more powers. There is no point in telling the Committee about a theoretical lack of power and asking it to join the circle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister recognise that the Government have power to set up public inquiries on whatever subject they want under the public inquiries legislation? The Government have chosen to ask councils to set up their own inquiries, and that is not because they lack the power themselves to set up judicial inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked when the social services inspectorate has not been able to make councils act on its advice,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1088</span>
because our impression is that the relationship between the Department and the inspectorate is good, which is to the credit of the inspectorate. Secondly, cannot the Government set up a public inquiry under their general public inquiry powers? Why is that extra power needed, unless it is to enforce privatisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having difficulty in following the hon. Lady's suggestion that in some way the powers of specific direction could be used to promote privatisation. I do not see the logic of that. The powers of specific direction are to correct abuses. The Secretary of State has no such power at present. It is entirely the responsibility of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot now cite chapter and verse examples of local authorities which have failed to proceed to correct abuses when their attention has been drawn to them. I appeal to the Committee's common sense—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but there is a certain amount of sub-committee work going on on one side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, Dame Janet, I cannot at this stage give instances of where the Secretary of State would have issued specific directions if he had had the power to do so. I appeal to the Committee to appreciate that the Association of Directors of Social Services has welcomed this provision, so the professional body concerned has accepted it. I understand that it has welcomed the provisions which we seek.

The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) asked whether powers of general inquiry could be used. I am advised that it is not appropriate to use those powers in all the circumstances where we think that it would be appropriate in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow my hon. Friend's argument and I ask him to confirm my understanding of the Bill, which is that if the Secretary of State wished to privatise the Health Service, as the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) suggested he might, he would need separate legislation to do so. Will he confirm that the Secretary of State could not proceed simply by a direction under this clause or otherwise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The Bill is not about privatising the Health Service or community care. I have given the Committee several assurances in this brief debate already, and as I said, I cannot follow the hon. Lady's logic when she argues against the powers of specific direction because she thinks that we would use it to privatise the Health Service. The logic is surely that if one accepts sections 7B and 7C, the power to holder inquiries, which must be helpful, and the power to issue default orders, one has to accept the principles of section 7A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
General directions could be embodied in circulars, although we do not intend to issue circulars as directions. Most of the content of circulars would be guidance. It is important to appreciate the sequence of using the various powers under the clause, which could be general directions on how social services are to be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1089</span>
provided, in the sense of drawing up care plans and assessment, perhaps an inquiry if there is a problem, perhaps a specific direction to correct the errors discovered in an inquiry, and then perhaps a default order under section 7C, which would be subject to clause 58.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about a mixed economy of care. I am concerned that a mixed economy exists in only one form of care—namely institutional care. A local authority may resist the placement of people in institutional care in the private sector because it does not believe that that is what is needed, on the basis of its assessment. In other words, it may feel that if the private sector wants to compete, it should compete on a domiciliary rather than an institutional basis. Could general directions not be used in such circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about specific directions and a local authority not discharging its duties under statute. The authority in Humberside was involved in a child care case recently, and an independent inquiry made certain recommendations. A major problem in Humberside is the desperate shortage of social workers. If the Humberside authority had been found at fault and specific directions were to be given, what would the Government's position be if they saw that the basic problem with the local authority, as it is with many local authorities, was a lack of staff to undertake statutory work? What would the Government do in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister continues, I remind hon. Members that interventions should be short. If hon. Members wish to elaborate, they should wait until they can catch the Chair's eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman. As for general directions, we propose to issue national guidelines on certain aspects of social care after full consultation. On the point about domiciliary and institutional care, we want there to be a balance of care—domiciliary services and residential services, and not only by local authority direct provision but by independent sector provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific directions would be used in relation to the balance of care provision. If a local authority falls down in its duty as a result of either dogma or sheer inefficiency and abuse, the Secretary of State would have the power to intervene. If the mixed economy of care, as I describe it, were not provided for one reason or another or as a result of either of the two extremes of political thought, the Secretary of State should and would be concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I shall quote the sentence on page 68 of the notes on clauses to which the hon. Member for Monklands, West drew my attention. I repeat the assurance given there on section 7A. It is as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Generally, it is intended that this power"—</p></blockquote>
the power to make directions—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be used infrequently and only to the extent necessary to safeguard the interests of users of services and their carers."</p></blockquote>
The power is not about advancing the cause of privatisation but protecting the best interests of patients
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1090</span>
and those who are socially cared for by local authorities. I hope that I have responded to the points made by the hon. Member for Monklands, West. It was a probing amendment, and I hope that he is satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has responded to me in his normal courteous way, but whether I am satisfied is a completely different matter. I think that Committee members are always pleased with the hon. Gentleman's bedside manner, but on this occasion he has left the.patient extremely worried. Given that I did not mention privatisation and that the Minister found it necessary to mention it three times, I am extremely worried about the powers.which the Secretary of State will take under the clause. I think that the cat has been let out of the bag.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses says that clause 44 will enable the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"to issue directions to local authorities covering all their social services functions",</p></blockquote>
not only community care. We are giving the Secretary of State a very important power, so there must be more than a suspicion now among Opposition Members that the power really is about privatisation and commercialism, and that when the Secretary of State disagrees with a local authority about its priorities, he will assume the power to intervene. He will not even have to report to Parliament on what he has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I described my amendment as being probing. As a result of what the Minister has told us, we are extremely worried. We are so worried that we shall not press the amendment this morning. He has opened the door to an extremely important issue, and for that reason we shall seek to raise the matter on Report. To accommodate that, I shall seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is right to probe a little more deeply into the powers which the clause gives to the Secretary of State, for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Monklands, West. I think, however, that the reasons which my hon. Friend the Minister gave for providing the powers are fully justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) challenged my hon. Friend the Minister on whether there had been instances where it would have been appropriate for the Secretary of State to have exercised such powers. Whether there are instances or not does not seem entirely relevant. Surely it is our job as legislators to try to visualise all possible circumstances and to legislate for them. In many instances, people have turned to the relevant legislation and found that it did not cover the combination of circumstances facing them, perhaps because in the Committee Room one Tuesday morning Members of Parliament had not thought of it. Therefore, I am sure that the powers should be in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that if a local authority were being particularly difficult and did not carry out the spirit or letter of the legislation, the Secretary of state may issue directions. If they were not complied with, he could obtain a court order for them to be complied with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1091</span>
under the same clause. All that can take time, and meanwhile an entire local authority service may fall into in abeyance while the legislative process takes its course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the default powers of the Secretary of State—that is, his powers to step in in certain circumstances to take over the running of the social services department of an authority. He referred to the National Assistance Act 1948, but under schedule 7 of the Bill those powers are repealed. Somewhere else in the Bill, or in some other legislation, there may be a default power for the Secretary of State to step in to take over the running of a social services department. God forbid that that should arise, but I think that we ought to bear that possibility in mind. Perhaps at this point, or it may, be more convenient when we reach schedule 7, my hon. Friend the Minister will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also referred to inquiries. I hope that there will be a mechanism to draw benefit from such inquiries. I have in mind the experience of legislation relating to children. In the past, there have been many local inquiries, one after the other, when something has gone wrong. Although they were admirable inquiries and reports were issued on them, that has been the end of the matter. There was no mechanism for drawing together the conclusions and ensuring that the lessons learnt were passed on to all those involved. I do not suggest tabling a new clause to set up a great co-ordinating body, or whatever. It is important, however, to have a mechanism to ensure that, when inquiries have reported, action is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. The proposed new section 7C refers to default powers. Directions in a default order are enforceable through the courts by writ of mandamus. The order that the Secretary of State would give, having been through the legislative procedure, would specify the duties that the offending local authority must correct and perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was perhaps worried about delay. It is likely that there would have been earlier stages before reaching the legislative procedure on default—that is, perhaps a social services inspectorate investigation, a specific direction or even an inquiry. I share my hon. Friend's concern about not wanting to prolong an abuse or error. I assure my hon. Friend that the Department of Health will act with all speed in cases brought to its attention of clear abuse or when the general principles of the Act or the general directions given by the Secretary of State are clearly not being complied with. We do not want years of delay. It is important that the Secretary of State can act quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new powers would complete the circle. In the past, the Secretary of State may have known of abuse, but could not act. He had no powers to set up an inquiry, to issue specific directions or to go to the courts in cases of default.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

about some of the duties. I am answering my hon. Friend's point in relation to what is likely to happen—for example, a specific problem with a home in relation to part of a care programme. That is a problem at present because it is either all or nothing. The provision gives the Secretary of State power to plug those loopholes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have come, Dame Janet to one the multiple choice questions that you occasionally set the class. I shall comment on amendments Nos. 252 and 253. Some of my hon. Friends will wish to speak to various other amendments which are of particular concern to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 252 and 253 bring us to the issue of ringfencing. I warn the Minister that these are not probing amendments. We take them extremely seriously, as no doubt he will do in his response. I hope, too, that I shall carry him with me in my arguments, if not in the Division, some of the Minister's Back Bench Colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to one of the major depatures, possibly the major one, from the Griffiths report—that is, their refusal to accept that the new system of community care should be built on the rock of a separate ringfenced grant. This is not a minor difference over an optional detail. A ringfenced grant was central to the structure proposed by Sir Roy Griffiths. Indeed, so central was it that its absence has been likened to the San Andreas fault. If left unattended,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1094</span>
this San Andreas fault is likely to have the same effect on the proposed new structure of community care as the actual fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may strain the metaphor, Ministers have tried to paper over the crack with assurances that Sir Roy Griffiths proposed a ringfenced grant only as a means of controlling local authorities expenditure. The implication is that Ministers should be praised for leaving local authorities their freedom rather than criticised for removing local authorities independence about how to use their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one swift and simple way to remove that defence. Those who are most vigorous in requesting a ringfenced grant to be imposed on them are the very local authorities that must implement the scheme. I do not refer only to the formal local authority associations. It is also the strong view of many councillors who are most active in social service committees. In the past month, I have spoken to the Labour caucus of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities social services committee and also the social service workshop at Labour's local government conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me assure you, Dame Janet, because I anticipate that you have not had experience of either body, that you could not hope to find two gatherings of councillors more jealous of local authority rights or more committed to local self-determination. The near unanimous view of all those present on both those occasions to which I have referred was that if the scheme is to work, there must be a ringfenced grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that is to be found in Sir Roy Griffiths's report. It is true that in chapter 5 of the report, where he discussed the ringfenced grant, he said that one reason for it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure transferred funds reach their intended destination".</p></blockquote>
That is the idea of the control mechanism. He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Social services authorities need security of funding if they are to plan to develop their community care services in a coherent way."</p></blockquote>
They need a ringfenced grant to ensure that transferred funds reach their intended destination and to create a more stable basis for the planning and delivery of the services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>It is pleasant for Ministers to say that they trust local authorities to ensure that funds reach their destination, but I should tell both Ministers here this morning that local authorities do not trust the Treasury to come up with the funds if there is not a ringfenced grant. That distrust will be all the greater if the funds are buried in the revenue support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several problems with making such funds available through the RSG. The first afflicts a minor number of local authorities, but for them it is a major problem. What about local authorities that receive no RSG? What about Islington? I understand that this year Oxfordshire may not receive RSG. Will those authorities not receive additional help for their additional responsibilities under the Bill? Will there be no transfer of funds from the DSS, which will be siphoned off?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem will be faced even by those local authorities that receive a revenue support grant. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1095</span>
may have difficulty spotting the funds when they are buried within the revenue support grant. I repeat my calculation on Second Reading: take the funds that the DSS currently provides for residential care and try to compute the proportion of those funds that might be transferred in any one year to social services authorities. Divide those funds by the number of social services authorities and the transfer will probably be less than £1 million a year per local authority. In all candour, the finance officers of those local authorities would need to borrow my wife's microscope to detect a sum as meagre as that buried beneath the £16,000 million revenue support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a nightmare, which I shall share with the Committee. In the autumn of 1991, the right hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Patten), if he has survived the shipwreck of the poll tax as Secretary of State for the Environment, will announce that once again, as a contribution to economic recovery, it will be necessary for local authorities to show restraint in expenditure, and that he has been obliged to reduce the revenue support grant. The Secretary of State for Health, whoever it is—I would not wish on the present Secretary of State the pain of presiding over the chaos of implementing this Bill—who has been found to register some enthusiasm for the proposals—perhaps the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies)—will tell the world on the same afternoon how delighted he is to announce that the element within the RSG for care in the community has been expanded. That statement will be utterly meaningless to local authorities, which will be left with the task, with which they are drearily familiar, of allocating cuts in all their services. If there is no ringfence grant to protect social services, those cuts will fall on care in the community too. In such circumstances, no chair of a social services committee will be able to persuade his colleagues on the finance committee that it is the moment in history to embark on an expansion of community care.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not lay claim to the bright future that the hon. Gentleman charts for me. Does he agree that his argument would apply to every item of local authority expenditure? The logic of his case is that the rate support grant—the revenue support grant as it will now be—should be ringfenced in every particular, thereby giving local authorities no discretion whatever in the expansion or contraction of their spending plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. He has explained precisely why all local authority associations have hitherto resisted ringfencing or hypothecation of any form of expenditure. They have been driven to reconsider that principle precisely because of the experience of the past 10 years, when thay have been left with responsibilities but without resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that we consider that change of principle in respect of the proposals, because once again local authorities are faced with new responsibilities. The Government suggest that there is no need for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1096</span>
them to be anxious about shouldering those responsibilities because they will be accompanied by extra resources, partly financed by running down DSS expenditure. In those novel circumstances, but in the light of their historic experience in the past 10 years, local authority associations will come to the view that they should accept what has happened in the past 10 years and the general basis of the revenue support grant. But they will want to test the bona fides and discover how genuine the Government are in saying that the responsibilities will be matched by new resources. Local authorities will insist that there should be a new defined grant to ensure that new resources come with the new responsibilities. That is a perfectly reasonable attitude and a perfectly reasonable distinction to make when considering the position of local authorities. They fund existing responsibilities with the existing funding mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Secretary of State-elect interrupted me, I was about to say that if anyone thinks that my remarks are fanciful, I invite them to contemplate the standard spending assessments issued by the Government in the past two months. One of the few advantages of the present funding system is that the Government state what they believe each social services authority should spend on social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are not those of the Department of Health; they were prepared by the Secretary of State for the Environment. When the figures were produced, the Secretary of State for Health welcomed them—in the terms of my nightmare—by saying that they provide for a 13 per cent increase in expenditure for social services. They do nothing of the kind. The figures represent a 13 per cent increase only when they are measured against what the Government said social services authorities should have spent last year. If they are measured against what social sevices authorities have actually spent this year, they are not an increase of 13 per cent: they are not an increase at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this year's expenditure on social services in England is uprated by 6 per cent for inflation, and the figure from that uprating is measured against the standard spending assessments issued by the Government, to get within those standard spending assessments local authorities in England will have to cut spending on social services by £200 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Six per cent is a modest estimate for inflation. Indeed, it looks as if we are now set for an 8 per cent rate of inflation at the start of the next financial year. An 8 per cent rate of inflation would imply a cut to get within the standing spending assessment of £275 million. Even if we assume that inflation in the next financial year will be only 6 per cent—it is a charitable assumption given the Government's incapacity to bring down interest rates—the Government guidelines to local authorities for spending on social services invite local authorities to trim from their provision the equivalent of 25,000 home helps or 70,000 places in day centres. In other words, the Government are inviting local authorities to make worse provision for care in the community at a time when there are more old people in our communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help my hon. Friend. The figures for his lcoal authority show that the standard spending assessment set by the Government requires a cut of 6.5 per cent in social services alone. In a sense, my hon. Friend is fortunate. Some Conservative Members are in a worse pickle. In Nottinghamshire the Secretary of State has approved a standard spending assessment that requires the social services authority servicing his own constituency to achieve a cut of 12.5 per cent. The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) will be interested to know that the standard spending assessment for Cheshire implies a cut of 15 per cent in social services expenditure. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) is no doubt outside on the telephone dealing with the anxieties created by the standard spending assessment for Derbyshire, which implies a cut of 27 per cent in social services expenditure. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), who follows these matters closely, is probably aware that the standard spending assessment for Ealing, Acton would require a cut of 14 per cent in social services spending.

The cuts will occur in the financial year 1990-1991, when the social services authorities should be gearing up to face the new system that we are about to approve. The new system will require them to increase expenditure on training and to recruit and train more staff to take on information technology to cope with the complex new requirements of the financial backing for the funding responsibilities. All of that is additional expenditure in the financial year for which the Government are requiring local authorities to cut expenditure on social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For local authorities, the alternative to cutting expenditure is to pile the difference on to the poll tax. Unfortunately, they need to increase the poll tax by 4 per cent for every extra 1 per cent of expenditure. That is not surprising because the poll tax was devised to make local taxation as unpleasant and unpopular as possible. It is having that effect. The figures are coming home to roost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two members of the Committee are from Maidstone. I note that 2,000 people gathered there the other week to complain about the poll tax. The Minister for Health, who is responsible for implementing the community care proposals, will be aware of the impact of the poll tax in the Tory heartlands. In her county, Surrey, every poll tax so far settled upon varies between £350 and £480.1 hope that the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) will be able to give a smaller figure for his patch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has omitted the larger part of my constituency, and there the city council has returned a community charge
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1098</span>
based on the Government's figures. Maidstone has been unable to emulate that because it is run by a Liberal-Labour alliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He has shown that the poll tax, like the plague, has fallen evenly on both Labour and Tory. I am open to correction, but I believe that there are relatively few Labour local authorities in Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire or Hertfordshire, all of which face enormous poll taxes. The reason why those local authorities will be obliged to levy poll taxes of over £400 relates directly to low standard spending assessments, which I have described to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the time for Opposition members to contemplate the misfortunes of Tory members with grim satisfaciton. Nor would I be in order were I to commiserate with you, Dame Janet, on Plymouth's poll tax of £328, which is a 50 per cent increase on the average rates bill per adult. Given this ludicrous and brutal form of local taxation, it is inconceivable that Ministers in even this Government could ask local authorities to fund expansion in care in the community by putting it on to the poll tax. If services are to expand, that expansion must be funded by central Government. If we are to be sure that central Government are making available a decent and fair grant, it must be separate and out in the open where we can all see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. How does he reconcile the fact that already social services authorities pay a substantial sum each year towards care in the community? That money is paid out of domestic and commercial rates and Government grant. Does the hon. Member agree that if the ringfencing that he wants were to come in, and if only central Government money were available for care in the community, the money paid by social service authorities would be lost to care in the community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Gentleman to study the Griffiths report more carefully. It is true that Griffiths proposed a ringfenced grant, and we want that grant to be in place to support expenditure. But the stress should be on the support of the expenditure, not on its replacement. The hon. Gentleman seemed to refer to the Griffiths report, but that report did not propose a grant of 100 per cent for expenditure on care in the community, or even a 50 per cent grant. Indeed, the report trails the possibility of the grant being as low as 40 per cent. But the report certainly proposed that every increase in expenditure that local authorities are obliged to make to fund care in the community should be partly funded by central Government grant and that that grant should be ear-marked and ringfenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposal is a perfectly fair deal for a partnership between central Government and local authorities. It will enable local authorities to discharge their community responsibility to adopt the new national responsibilities imposed by the Bill. It is not fair to ask local authorities to accept responsibility for community care by national legislation without a guarantee that even 50 per cent of it will be funded by means of ringfenced grants.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1099</span>
The Minister for Health is in the Committee room, but she is not to respond to the amendment. She has responded on many previous occasions, when she has assured us that the Bill will produce a higher quality and larger quantity of care. But, it remains to be explained—that task falls to the Under-Secretary—how that higher quality and larger quantity of care will be achieved without a new grant, or without the funds being ringfenced to make sure that they go into community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be mildly mischievous in that I suspect that the Secretary of State—who is now in the Committee room—agrees with the Griffiths report. I shall be even more subversive, though I do not want to prejudice this afternoon's talks at ACAS, and say that I believe that the Secretary of State agrees with me on ringfencing. I have a suspicion that the ringfenced grant was not struck out in Richmond terrace. The boot was put into it by the Treasury, which is astute enough to know that it is much easier to dishonour a payment if it is buried in another, much larger, payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary know that their bargaining with the Treasury would be greatly strengthened if they were to propose to make a clearly labelled, ringfenced grant to local authorities. Whatever half-hearted arguments the Under-Secretary uses in response to the debate, it would be wise for the Committee to read between the lines of his speech, and to accept the covert invitation that will be in it to vote him down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: that would do him a favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Peck-ham (Ms. Harman) says, we would be doing the Under-Secretary a favour. We would be strengthening the hand of Ministers in future negotiations. We would be protecting local authorities, which could then know the amount of the grant available. Most of all, we would be protecting old people, the disabled and users of mental health services. A ringfenced grant will be the only way to guarantee that their services will be properly funded by a Government who will have to come clear about the amount of cash that they will put into such services, and the only way to guarantee that local authorities will have to spend those resources on such services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, and especially for the sake of the users of the community care services, I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful for the Committee if I outline briefly the rationale behind the Government thinking and deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). I shall try to be brief because I expect that many hon. Members will want to contribute to the debate. Perhaps my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will wish to do so later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our general approach is that when we provide additional resources for personal social services we should trust social services authorities to make the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1100</span>
right decisions and to set the right priorities in relation to other departments of local government. That trust is borne out by the facts. Spending on personal social services over the past 10 years has increased in real terms by 37 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) might seek to disabuse the Committee on that point, but generally speaking social services departments fight their corners extremely well and are successful in obtaining additional resources and a higher growth rate than other divisions of local authorities. We therefore disagree with the argument that money has to be ring-fenced to ensure that it reaches the right departments. The hon. Member for Livingston produced no evidence to show that councillors who sit on social services department committees are perpetually weak-kneed and ineffective at fighting their corners in setting local priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alum Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman makes a speech, I and my right hon. and learned Friend will listen to him with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the mental illness grant, which is specific and ringfenced, we are dealing with local authorities that already have well-established programmes for residential and domiciliary care. We shall add resources to those programmes rather than establish new programmes. Our general approach to local authorities has been to trust them to make the right decisions, and they have proved that they are able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are exceptions, including, for example, provision for AIDS or for mental illness. The general exceptions fall into three categories. First, a programme might have low or perhaps even no expenditure. That is the case with mental illness; only 3 per cent of the expenditure of social services departments goes on care for the mentally ill. I shall be interested to hear whether hon. Members believe that any other category of expenditure falls under that heading. I suspect that no others do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, because of a change of Government policy towards the care of a particular client group, urgent pump priming might need to be done. Local authorities have long since discharged the function of providing residential and domiciliary care. We do not propose a full-scale change in the provision of those services but we shall add important new powers for assessment and for finance. Mental illness is a non-partisan matter. Care in the community for some of those who are mentally ill needs major pump priming. Central government and the Department of Health will accept their part-share of those responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third exception is where the Department of Health has an extended responsibility for the care of a patient or of a client group in the community. That is the position for AIDS patients who need social care. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0949">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1101</span>
is also the position for the mentally ill. A schizophrenic who is discharged from hospital because he is well still needs constant and prolonged care, and the Department of Health has an extended responsibility for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was anticipation on both sides of the Committee when the Under-Secretary took the unexepected step of speaking immediately after the speech of the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). Far from meeting the expectations of Committee members and setting out the Government's thinking, the Under-Secretary is replying to the debate even before it has taken place. I suspect that he is doing so not from deference to or interest in the views of the Opposition or his own Back Benchers but because of the presence in Committee of television cameras, and he is hereby treating the Committee with contempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that the rules about which hon. Member speaks and when are more relaxed in Committee than they are in the House. Ministers have spoken early when cameras were not present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to the contribution of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). I have made it clear that the debate should and will be replied to by more than one Minister if necessary, with competence and courtesy, I am trying to help the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before concluding, I shall deal briefly with the points raised by the hon. Member for Livingston. All three of his assertions were wrong, and it is important to correct the record before we continue with the debate. He claimed that the amount of additional resources that the Department of Social Security will make available to the Department of the Environment for the revenue support grant will be secret. During summer and early autumn the Government, through the normal public expenditure survey procedure, will settle the amount to be transferred from the DSS. That amount, which would have been spent on the social care of those who would have been in residential and nursing home care, will be made public. Paragraph 8.24 of the White Paper gives a clear commitment to that, and an announcement will be made in due course. No one is seeking to make the amount secret. An assertion made by the hon. Member for Livingston on Second Reading implied that local authorities not receiving the revenue support grant would be unable to help elderly patients needing assessment. That assertion was wrong. No personal social services authority will fail to receive a revenue support grant, and the hon. Gentleman should put the record straight. He misinformed the Committee. In the shire counties some district councils do not receive revenue support grants—the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) probably includes such a district council. But district councils are not personal social serrvices authorities. There are no such authorities that do not receive the revenue support grant. The mechanism is in place, therefore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston referred at length to the inadequate standard spending assessment, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1102</span>
he confused it with the incremental amount that will be transferred. His argument is valid in so far as it relates to the current levels of standard spending assessments, but it is irrelevant to the debate. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear that we shall transfer a new sum through the revenue support grant, and therefore the arguments of the hon. Gentleman do no apply. It will be a new incremental amount added to existing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is specious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not specious. If the hon. Gentleman thinks about it, he will realise that the comments of the hon. Member for Livingston related to existing standard spending assessments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have assessed that Cumbria should spend almost £30 million on its social services, which include the provision of services for the handicapped, homes for the elderly and money to deal with the problem of child abuse, an important issue about which the public are very worried. Its budget requires that it spends £33 million in the coming year, and it cannot make cuts. If it complies with Government assessments of what it has to spend, it will have to cut its budget by 10 per cent., or over £3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How shall we find the money to service the Bill and to provide for present services? Should we close down the homes for the elderly and the mentally handicapped? Should we remove the people who currently work on child abuse? Should we withdraw services such as home helps for the elderly generally? Should we simply withdraw those services in order to comply with the guidelines, yet in addition accept the increased responsibilities placed on Cumbria county council? The population simply will not stand for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall listen to what the hon. Gentleman may say in a more substantive contribution later—but there is a distinction. First, there are our proposals to transfer additional sums for the social care element of those who currently receive income support from the Department of Social Security to the Department of the Environment, to be distributed through the revenue support grant. That is a quite separate additional and incremental amount. The dilemma which the hon. Gentleman's local authority currently faces must be solved by the local authority and the local citizens. That is not being debated on these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those few remarks, I conclude what I have to say—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I assure the Committee that I, or my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, will reply in full to the rest of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was right to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) was courteous, but whether his own speech exhibited candour and competence is a different matter. He said that he was attempting to reply to the three major points which my hon. Friend made, but once again he left us with even greater worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government established the principle when they agreed to ringfencing for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0950">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1103</span>
mentally ill, but that it should not be regarded as a precedent. He has persuaded absolutely nobody on that point, all the more so because when the problems of community care were identified by Sir Roy Griffiths on the basis of evidence from the Public Accounts Commission, it was quite clear that a major criticism of the way in which community care is approached at present was that we simply do not know how all the money is being spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have added to the problem, because they accepted the Griffiths recommendation—there was a case for it, of course—that the element of social security payment which at present is not being made available via the local authorities should now be transferred to the local authorities, which would then make arrangements for residential care. It would be astonishing if, faced with that, local authorities were not worried about the money being ringfenced, because the responsibilities of the local authorities are clearly identified. If local authorities find that the Government have not made it clear that a specific allocation is being made for these specific purposes, their worry is, on current evidence, that demands on their budgets can be made by other departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the public, including the user, have been led to believe that the Government have made funding available, the truth is that other demands may have swallowed it up. That is surely a genuine and reasonable worry, if only because the local authorities have to take on board comprehensive community care provision—including housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to housing. I am worried about the housing shortage, and I wonder where the resources will come from to help with mental health. I refer to the success in Wales, for instance, of schemes such as Nimrod in helping people move from institutions into a more independent lifestyle; to the elderly discharge scheme, which is valued but underfunded; and to the all-Wales strategy. All those schemes depend upon finance for accommodation. The Government must recognise that funds for housing for the mentally ill and for disabled and elderly people are absolutely essential; otherwise, care in the community will remain an aspiration and cannot be made to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are being pushed towards providing housing for the elderly, and that has reduced the funds available for other forms of housing. Unless the housing element is addressed, as in our amendment, the whole of community care will be undermined, especially as only yesterday in the other place a Minister said that much could be done with the resources currently available. Additional resources will clearly be needed for housing and other elements of the package of care, if community care is going to mean anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff has gone to the heart of the problem. He is right to identify housing as a problem, because given the constraints on local authorities, if money is to be made available for special needs—for sheltered housing and so on—and there is a clamour for that money
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1104</span>
for other types of housing, I am afraid that the money will often not be spent on community care provision at all. It will be spent on those other types of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second charge that the Minister levelled against my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston was that my hon. Friend had implied that local authorities would not be able to help elderly people needing assessment. In terms of the revenue support grant, surely it is self-evident that if there are two major pressures on local authorities—the first being that funding for community care is inadequate, and the second, that if they impose that on the poll tax, people will be poll-taxed—all services including assessments for the elderly will be bound to suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, Keith Bradley (Manchester, Withihgton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has failed to address the two fundamental issues about funding. I hope that when he replies he will comment on the Minister of Health's remark last week that the reason why the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986, which underpins community care, had not been implemented was the lack of resources in local authority social services departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Manchester, there is a £6 million shortfall between the spending assessment—not the incremental increase—and the base budget expenditure. Home helps and elderly persons' homes, for example, may have to be dispensed with to meet that shortfall. How can community care be implemented in cities such as Manchester when baseline services which people rely on are already having to be shed because of a lack of resources, now and in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has drawn attention to some very important points. I have visited Manchester several times in recent years, and I know that social services and proper community care provision are seen there as a great priority. He will agree, I am sure, that the influence of Cath Robinson is very important in that field, but the two problems which he identified are not only applicable to Manchester: they are highly relevant to this debate on ringfencing community care for the whole of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) anticipated me by a few minutes when he spoke about the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 and the report which was made available to the Secretary of State. That report by the Minister's social services inspectorate identified lethargy—the non-implementation of that important Act, and the fact that the sections which have been implemented have not been implemented very efficiently. If ever there was an argument for ringfencing, it is contained in that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say time and time again that resources are not yet available to implement the remainder of the Act. We cannot say with any certainty that the inadequate moneys allocated for the sections of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 that have already been implemented are being spent in the way that was intended because the allocation were so vague. Sir Roy Griffiths was concerned about it and so were the local authorities, and they were right to be worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1105</span>
Ministers argue that local authority autonomy will somehow be removed but local authorities are among the many who clamour to support Sir Roy Griffiths in his support for ringfencing, and they are right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work of the all-party committee on disability and community care is chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley). The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) is a member. It is an effective group and its work is important. The committee received evidence that money that had been allocated for sections of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 had been used for road repairs. That degree of lethargy, slovenliness and lack of accountability is unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situtation in London is every bit as bad as my hon. Friend describes. Community care services will be devastated if the Government's plans for cutting social services provision are allowed to proceed. The Government have told social services in inner London to cut £54.15 million from their spending and in outer London to cut £57.07 million. Will my hon. Friend back my appeal to the Minister urgently to seek a meeting with the Secretary of State for the Environment to ask him to explain to councils in London how they will provide the services on which the elderly and disabled so depend? The elderly and disabled will be twice victims, first because the services on which they depend will be stripped away and, secondly, because they will be clobbered by an increased poll tax bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point is valid and, as always, she is well informed. One of the difficulties about the clause and about the Government's resistance to ringfencing is that they are increasing the expectations of consumers, including my hon. Friend's constituents in Peckham, by giving the impression that the Bill will improve the provision of community care. The reality is different. The approach of the Secretary of State for the Environment is to constrain local government spending. That approach, combined with the poll tax, means that the pressures on local authorities, especially those authorities mentioned by my hon. Friend, will become profound indeed. That is tragic. The pressures on the NHS mean that the strains on local authorities and voluntary organisations are becoming greater as resourcing and funding diminish and we fail to identify even the funding made available by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main influence on Government thinking on the issue is the Treasury. The evidence suggests that the Treasury does not believe that social services' provision of community care is a leading priority—far from it. People are being thrown on the mercy of market forces. Local authorities such as Manchester and others have a genuine wish to take account of the needs of the most vulnerable people—the frail, the elderly, the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped, the physically disabled and their careers in the community. In the context of inadequate resourcing, those local authorities need to know what Government resources will be available to them so that they can draw up plans for community care. Community care is an essential element both of the Griffiths report and of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks with enormous passion and conviction, but his passion will fall on the deaf ears of the three Ministers, who fail to recognise that there is human tragedy at local level. A constituent of mine, Mrs. Jean George, has been waiting for over two years for a chair lift to be installed, because of the enormous queue for assessment by an occupational therapist. The local authority director of social services, Mr. Rice, has written to me on many occasions to say that it is not the fault of the local authority. I raised the matter with the Under-Secretary of State during an Adjournment debate last year. It is the failure of Government to provide the necessary resources that leads to people like Mrs. George being unable to escape the human tragedy.

As a team leader, I had to decide whetherto allocate a social worker to investigate complaints of child neglect or to a young mentally handicapped adult, living with a parent, who had difficulties at home. I allocated the social worker to the case of child neglect, as anyone else would have done, but the mentally handicapped adult might have been someone like Beverly Lewis.

its thinking on ordinary people. Today we are considering the problems and the plight of ordinary people, and I have a greater compassion for them than for the Treasury. The Treasury has greater influence on Government policies, however, especially on their stubborn and unacceptable resistance to ringfencing. That does not help any strategy for a future community care policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchcliffe), brought things down to the level of people. For example, many mentally ill people who come out of institutional care end up living in cardboard boxes on the streets of the city. Earlier the Under-Secretary talked about new money, but we shall not be able to see that new money unless it is separate. Was not the gaff blown by a comment made yesterday in the other place by the Under-Secretary of State of Health, Baroness Hooper, who talked about community care not being a cheap option and local commitment and collaboration being important, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we take the view that much can be done using existing resources."—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> February 1990: Vol. 516, c. 3.]</p></blockquote>
Is not the issue getting sufficient resources if community care is to mean anything at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The issues are inadequate funding and ensuring that available funding is used for the purpose that was intended. That, simply is what ringfencing will ensure. That is why it appealed to Sir Roy Griffiths. That is why it is supported by so many people, including local authorities. That is why the Government have not produced a convincing reason for resisting it. Perhaps the Treasury seeks to restrict still more the resources that it will make available for those vital needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman keeps labouring what he believes to be Treasury influence, will he confirm whether his shadow cabinet acknowledges the principal of ringfencing about which he is so passionate? How does he square what he is saying with the speech made in the House last week by the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who made it clear that a future Labour Government would not be committed to increasing public expenditure on the NHS or social services as a priority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be extremely happy to develop that point if it were relevant. I am happy to assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that our view on ringfencing is supported overwhelmingly by local authorities of various political opinions and my colleagues in the shadow cabinet, so he need have no worries on that score. He can go back to the Inn on the Park hotel this evening and relax in the knowledge that the next Labour Government will make up the deficiency and face the mandarins in the Treasury with whom he has failed to deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1108</span>
contrast to that made by Conservative ones. In terms of provision for the elderly and the handicapped and general support services for the clients of social services departments, Labour scores where Tories fail. The record is in all local government indices, even those produced by this Government, some of which are before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct, as is confirmed by the lack of a challenge from Conservative Members. Labour authorities realise that their priorities ought to be with the most frail and vulnerable in the community, and are responding to them in community care and social services policies, as I am sure the British people recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Secretary of State's narrow political intervention, I do not wish to be unfair to Conservative local authorities. They, too, have been arguing for ringfencing. In Tayside, for example, last week the Conservative minority supported the Labour group in a motion that deplored the Government's policy and supported the belief that if one accepts—following the Griffiths report—that the problems are immense, one has to accept also that ringfencing should be an essential part of Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston was wrong to think that the figures were being kept secret. The Under-Secretary might, uncharacteristically, have missed the point, which was that Ministers can declare that resources are not available for certain Departments while Ministers in those Departments say that their budgets have increased. That situation would not be new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The method for dealing with support grants for local authorities is vague. That vagueness will enable the Secretary of State for the Environment, for example, to say that more money will be available for community care, and the Secretary of State for Health could confirm that. However, local authorities will be unable to provide more for community care if they are to meet other demands, such as those placed on them by new legislation, including the Children Act 1989. That means that my hon. Friend was correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Minister's speech I have checked with the AM A, which advised me that in the current year three shire counties and one London borough are not receiving lp in revenue support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those social services authorities might acquire grant in the forthcoming year under the new system. However, social service authorities have gone in and out of grant over the past 10 years, and the fact that they are going back into grant next year does not mean that they will be in grant the year after that, when the new system comes into operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the light of that information, does the Minister intend to withdraw his statement, which was that my hon. Friend was wrong? My hon. Friend has now been proved right.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is experienced enough to know that that is not a point of order. The Minister has already said that he, or one of his colleagues, will sum up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have welcomed all of the interventions. I shall now draw my remarks to a close, if only because I look forward with interest and relish to the response of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative and Opposition Members could give examples from their constituencies when it would have been possible to respond better to community care needs if ringfencing had existed. Wandsworth has been the subject of considerable debate in Committee and elsewhere. The Secretary of State blamed the Wandsworth managers for overspending on their mental health budget. That was not good news for Scotland, as we discovered that some of the managers who were blamed were to be switched to Scotland. An accountant, Mr. Don Cruickshank, who had chaired the authority has been switched to head the National Health Service in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We worry about those who were blamed. What will happen if, within the constraints of the ringfencing of grants for the mentally ill, services cannot be provided to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State? How can he be sure that his objectives will be met if there is no ringfencing of grants for local authorities which are supposed to work with health authorities to provide community care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Mr. Cruickshank has moved to Scotland, I shall give a Scottish example of how in the absence of ring-fencing, it will be difficult to ensure that community care objectives are achieved. In Helensburgh, the local branch of the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped worked with the Argyll and Bute health authority and with other local authorities to develop a new centre for the mentally handicapped. Their plans were well under way when it was discovered that the local health board considered that the demands on it were so great that it could not meet its part of the bargain. If such pressures are imposed on local health boards, local authorities and voluntary organisations will come under greater pressure, especially as the Government's free market policies develop. The clients and the carers who were looking forward to the opening of that centre in Helensburgh now find that it will not be opened. If that is happening now, imagine what will happen as the Government's policies develop. The strains on the Health Service will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1110</span>
The demographic problem of an ageing population is apparent as, I am happy to say, people are living longer. I accept that the health authorities and local authorities have to face that problem. The Government say that the Bill will take all those problems into account without ringfencing, but no one who works in community care agrees that that policy will work. Conservative members have made many references to removing local authority discretion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way for the last time, as I am genuinely trying to finish my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Gentleman with great interest. I could accept his argument if it matched the performance of Labour Governments. The evidence is that Labour government's have 18 months of glorious spend, spend, spend which are followed by cuts on a scale of which most Tory free marketeers can only dream.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to discuss Labour's record, but I am sure that you would not allow me to do so, Dame Janet. I should prefer to accept not the hon. Gentleman's brief interpretation of Labour's record but the verdict of public opinion. On the issue of the Health Service, the Labour party, both in Government and in Opposition, has always been miles ahead of the Conservatives in terms of public opinion. I am happy to accept that verdict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is significant also that under a Labour Government the grant to local government was 66 per cent, of local government expenditure, and under the present Government it is 33 per cent. That is what has caused all the trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that. The number of profoundly mentally handicapped persons has not necessarily fallen, but the number of places for them in suitable accommodation has. Such people must, therefore, be with their families. We must ask whether those who provide care in the community, including parents and other carers, are given adequate support. We believe that they are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State genuinely wants community care to work, he must remember that 90 per cent, of the people about whom we are worried—the elderly, the frail, the vulnerable, the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and the physically disabled—and their carers are already in the community. It is important not only to ensure their independence but to recognise that support within the community is vital. Such support as home help, nursing care, occupational therapy and so on is important if people are to feel that they can live independently in the community. Central and local government policies should show a mutual concern for their interests, and that must be properly planned, funded and recognisable, with a level of accountability that is missing under the present system. That is why

the Opposition believe that the Government's argument against ringfencing is weak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend to address himself to a list produced by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and other, which details the abilities of local authorities to spend in line with their standard spending assessments. It shows that many Conservative-controlled authorities do not spend on social services what the Government believe that they should. Kent is one of them. There are three members of the Committee whose constituencies are in Kent, yet none of them has today criticised the spending activities of the social services departments in their areas, because they know it would embarrass the Government. If they were to meet even the standard set by the Government, which in the constituencies of many Opposition Members is unsatisfactory, it would lead to an increase in provision. That increase would be especially noticeable in the constituency of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) who, it is interesting to note, was quick to point to the fact that in his area the poll tax has been fixed at the level required by the Government. He did not admit that inadequate money is being spent on social services there, and even now he does not rise to defend his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) could scarcely rise on an intervention of such inordinate length. This is the third time this morning that I have reminded the Committee that interventions should be short. If they are not short, I shall cut in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely trying to conclude. The Government's main argument is centred on their worry, as they express it, that local authorities would be denied discretion. That is an interesting view from this Government who, hitherto, have not fallen over themselves in trying to give discretion to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, I met the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), who was then Secretary of State for Scotland. Creative accountancy exists in Scotland, too, and even under such a charming person the right hon. Gentleman. He had announced one of the most savage cuts in RSG and grant support for local authorities. He explained to COSLA and to the press that he was trying to help local authorities because he had similar problems. My response then was that I was convinced that Sweeney Todd had managed to persuade his victims that he was doing them a favour before he cut their throats. I feel that the Government's arguments about discretion may be compatible with that view. I wonder whether local authorities are convinced that the Government are demanding discretion on their behalf. They are not that sort of Government. That is why local authorities plead, as we do, for ringfencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appeal for discretion yet, in the same clause, give powers of direction to the Secretary of State. They call for discretion, but not for the frail and the vulnerable or for those in the community whose needs we seek to tackle; they do so for them-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1112</span>
selves, their Treasury, their limited fiscal policies and their market approach to such matters. We cannot support that discretion. It has not helped the Health Service or community care provision. We cannot support the Government's policies this morning. I give the Secretary of State notice that if, in spite of the logic of our argument and the support that we have for it, the Government vote against our reasonable proposals for ringfencing, we shall oppose the Government and shall invite the British poeple to reach their own conclusion when the time comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly speak to amendments Nos. 551 and 504, but first wish to comment on ringfencing. I shall endeavour to speak for one tenth of the time taken by the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am undecided about the broader issue of ringfencing. I understand the argument against it: that a local authority sees more clearly than Whitehall local priorities and needs and so it would be wrong to circumscribe local decision-making by ringfencing. However, here is a Government policy in which much political capital has been invested and which Conservative Members wish to be successful. The argument is whether the policy is more likely to be implemented properly if the money is ringfenced
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there is a language problem in this respect for Ministers. I welcomed the intervention of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State because it helps when the Government's position is clarified. He said that we should trust local authorities to get it right. He rightly said that, historically, local authorities have increased spending on social services. He took pride in that and so do I. But they are spending above their standing spending assessments and, historically, have spent above their GREAs—their grant-related expenditure assessments. Social service Ministers have taken pride in the fact that local authorities have protected their services. Education Ministers take exactly the same line. They take credit for the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, the increase in expenditure per child at school, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that different signals are being given by the Department of the Environment; the Department has made it clear that local authorities have not got it right because they are spending too much. We have been asked to consider accepting assurances that the money will go through—that adequate funds will be made available to local authorities without being ringfenced—or that the Department of the Environment, which settles the revenue support grant, will take a robust view of what local authorities ought to spend and provide inadequate funds. Because Government policy is involved, I see the argument for making the funds transparent. One could then see how much money the Government were putting into the implementation of their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the local level, I should find it easier to defend the Government's policy if I could go back to Ealing and say that from 1 April 1991 the Government will allocate a specific sum of money to implement care in the community. If the money is not ringfenced, in a year's time there will be widespread disappointment in my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1113</span>
constituency about the failure of local authorities to provide a package of care and to buy in contracts. It will not be possible to decide whether the local authority has got its priority wrong by spending money in other areas or whether the Government have not given the right resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my mind is unclear at this stage, I see merit in the idea of ringfencing the money during the initial stages of the policy's implementation. People could then see how much extra money local authorities would get to do what the Government want them to do. If the money is not ringfenced, I foresee a series of local arguments about who is responsible if the policy is not fully implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want more reassurances that non-ringfencing is right, especially given the rather cautious words of the Department of the Environment about the spending patterns of local authorities. If that sets the tone for the implementation of care in the community, the prospects of local authorities getting the resources will be poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 551 reflects anxiety about the viability of hostels that provide services for drug addicts and alcoholics once they switch to the new funding regime next year. Those hostels have been provided with capital largely from Government Departments, including the Home Office, the Department of the Environment under the urban programme and the Department of Health. Revenue funding comes mainly from income support, which includes care costs. The problem is that from 1 April 1991 many of those hostels will not get protection from transitional funding to the same extent that residential or nursing homes will do, simply because they have a faster turnover of clients. They will find that in 1991 their clients will get only income support and housing benefit. The hostels will be able to continue providing care only if local authorities decide to fund them in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are worried that local authorities will not take the bold decision to continue to provide revenue funding for a large number of hostels. Several hostels in my constituency, provided by Turning Point, for example, may not be viable if local authorities do not decide soon to take over responsibility for supporting them financially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 504 is broadly couched and deals with problems in rural areas. People are worried that voluntary organisations in London that provide services for drug addicts, alcoholics or those suffering from AIDS will not get the resources that they need. Many people who benefit from their services are not community charge payers, and it is difficult for a local authority in London to know where a client has come from, especially when it deals with the homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities may be reluctant to continue to fund hostels in their boroughs if there is a moving clientele of people who have come from other London boroughs or from outside London. Organisations and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1114</span>
boroughs in London are looking for an assurance that, under the new regime, voluntary organisations in London—which meets the needs of a capital as well as the needs of London residents—will continue to get the resources that they need to provide services which are widely appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8.19 of the community care White Paper states that the Government will give further consideration to those matters. The Government should flesh out that paragraph, if they can. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is giving further consideration to how those arrangements will operate in practice."</p></blockquote>
Those are the arrangements for the residential establishments about which I have been talking. If the Government can shed some light on that, it would be welcomed by those who provide such services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Mon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to heed Sir Roy Griffiths' report on community care. He felt that it was necessary to have a specific grant for community care. Speaking of the new central Government grant system, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While the new system of central government grant is intended to be simpler than the existing system, it will retain many of the features which have been found to impede the development of community care. The process of grant determination will still be an annual one and there is no proposal to issue indicative planning figures for future years."</p></blockquote>
In other words, Sir Roy Griffiths identified one of the major problems about not ringfencing, which is that essential services will have to compete for local authority budgets. There would be great difficulty in allocating resources to the various departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was on the Committee that dealt with the Children Bill, which placed further responsibilities on social services departments. How on earth can we expect social services departments to choose between, say, developing provisions for preventing child abuse and looking after elderly people at home? We should not force local authorities to make that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On several occasions in Committee and elsewhere, we have reminded ourselves that the Bill gives local authorities new responsibilities over and above those that they or the Department of Social Security now have. It would be well to remind ourselves of those responsibilities, which are set out in paragraph 3.13 of the White Paper "Caring for People". They include: carrying out assessments; designing packages of services; securing the delivery of services; establishing complaints procedures; monitoring the quality and cost-effectiveness of the service; and establishing a financial assessment procedure. The White Paper acknowledges that local
	<br><blockquote><p>"authorities may need to strengthen their existing management arrangements."</p></blockquote>
These are new services and responsibilities for local authorities. However, we are told that—the Secretary of State will correct me if I am wrong—the money to be allocated to them is that which is currently allocated by the Department of Social Security to maintain people in residential institutions. In other words, there will be no substantial increase in the budget. If that is not the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0956">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1115</span>
case and there is to be substantial extra funding, the Committee is entitled to know what it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional resources need to take into account the need for training within not only social services departments but the voluntary sector. As we have said on several occasions in Committee, the new responsibilities in the voluntary sector will mean that it will not only supplement the work of the local social services departments, but be expected to deliver services on its own. That means that the dedicated bands of volunteers must now be properly trained to carry out their responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason why Opposition Members and local authorities want the money to be ringfenced is that the authorities will know that a specific sum of money has been allocated for a specific purpose, how that money will be spent and what the need will be to match those resources. Sir Roy Griffiths identified that need in his report. The Department of Health might agree with those sentiments, because in its annual report to Parliament it could say how the money had been spent and how wonderful it had been in discharging its responsibilities. But I can equally understand the Treasury attempting to block it. When a specific grant had been ringfenced and a need above what was originally estimated had been identified, the Treasury would have to admit that the grant would have to be increased each year. I could understand the Treasury being reluctant to agree to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for the ringfence grant has been powerfully and persuasively advanced by hon. Members. It is so overwhelming that I suspect that Conservative Members may be convinced by it. I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) who, in his own way, prodded the Government to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ringfencing of the grant would give local authorities the confidence to plan. It would allow social services departments a specific sum to carry out the responsibilities that Parliament expects them to discharge. They do not want to have to compete with colleagues in the same department in respect of the Children Act 1989, but they have to compete with education and other services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is overwhelming support for our proposals in the country. The only stumbling block is the Treasury, and I hope that the Secretary of State will use the arguments advanced by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee in his discussions with that Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) leaps to his feet to comment on the unusual position of my speech in the debate, I explain that my reason for speaking now has nothing to do with the television cameras. I did not know that they would be in the Committee room this morning. There are other events in my Department today. I hope to return to the Committee this afternoon and stay for the evening but I cannot guarantee that I shall not be called away because of events at AC AS or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) expressed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1116</span>
his doubts, I do not have time to argue at length so I shall concentrate on the key issue. There is no sinister battle between the Treasury and the Department of Health. I am not being indiscreet when I say that when we discussed the Griffiths report my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for the Environment, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and I rapidly agreed that there was no compelling case for a specific grant. Indeed, it would possibly be retrograde. The question is who should have responsibility for delivery of care-in-the-community policies: who should decide the priority in the use of resources and who should account for their use? The agreed policy which lies behind the Bill—it is Government policy but it is accepted by the local authority associations—is that it is right to give the local authorities the lead responsibility for care in the community and for everything that flows from it. They will require an additional allocation of resources from central Government well above what they have had in the past to discharge that responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be right, having handed over responsibility, for Government, at the behest of this Committee or of Parliament, to say, "We are giving you this responsibility. But we will so frame the legislation that for the indefinite future we shall retain the right to take key decisions about the respective priority to be given vis-a-vis other local authority responsibilities."

That is the key issue. The arguments about ring-fencing could be, and in my experience have been, raised on many Bills about all sorts of other key responsibilities of local government. It is a failing of Ministers and of Parliament to say in the first breath that they wil pass these matters to local government and leave the responsibility in its hands if a choice is to be made and then to say that the Government will exercise a strong central interest in what they do.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The history of central Government trying to determine the priorities or to control the delivery of local government services is an unhappy one under Governments of any colour.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is defending the Government's position entirely on the ground that it would be wrong to impose central control on local authorities. How does he explain why every local authority association is seeking a ringfence grant? They want a ringfence grant not because they are worried about spending the money on community care but because they are worried that Ministers will not give them the resources that they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman slightly rephrased what I said. I do not make my case on the basis that it is kind or generous to local authorities, but it is not hostile to them either. I am saying that when responsibility and accountability is in the hands of local government, the choice of priorities, including those within the social services budgets, must remain in the hands of local government too. It is wrong to try to devise a system whereby we pass on the responsibility but central Government retain the right, for the indefinite future, to maintain the amount of money that need be spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If local authorities are pushed by their electorate into reducing poll tax, or not increasing it unreasonably, how will the services be protected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of the community charge is to make local authorities more accountable to their local electorate. The standard spending assessment is not a target at which they should aim, in the case of Kent, nor is it a level to which they are obliged to reduce if they want to spend above it. It is for local government to determine what it will spend on its services. It will be answerable to the electorate for the resulting charges and for determining the priorities between different services. You would call me to order, Dame Janet, if I launched into a speech on the community charge.

In Cumbria and elsewhere, local authorities wish to have the pleasant part of the responsibility, which is to provide services in response to local demands. They are anxious, however, to avoid any liability for the consequences of their spending decisions or their priorities.

To return to the amendment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman), the Under-Sec-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1118</span>
retary of State for Health, rightly said, there is little need for social services enthusiasts to fear that social services budgets will be intruded on in order to spend more money on roads and other things. The majority of members of the Committee tend to be social services rather than education specialists. Isolated examples do not undermine the general proposition that most authorities, Conservative or Labour, tend to spend more on social services than is indicated by what the Government say, and they sometimes raid the revenue support grant for other sectors in order to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problems are usually within social services budgets. It is extremely difficult to determine what priority to give to children, to the needs of the retired, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped. Enthusiasts for community care tend to be worried that too much might go towards implementing the Children Act 1989 unless there is ringfencing. There are delicate decisions to be taken. There is a variety of views about comparable expenditure, but that is essentially a key feature to be placed in the hands of local authorities. When they have the new revenue support grant, it will be increased by a visible transfer from social security of the amount of money they would have spent before. To set the revenue support grant, we would have to take account of the predictable and growing need for the provision of care in the community. Specific grants would be inimical to the whole policy. It shows that Opposition Members have underlying doubts about whether local government can be trusted with the policy and that they want a specific grant. We are against specific grants. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will wind up the debate but it is the case—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
