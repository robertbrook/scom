<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greg Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee at its rising this sitting do adjourn till Tuesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not while we are dealing with this matter.</span></p>
<p>Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I should like to raise a matter that I raised informally at our first sitting and which has also been raised informally with me by some colleagues: the absence of natural light at our morning sittings.<br><br>
I draw attention to the screens behind us. I do not want to spend the next two months like a mushroom in artificial light fed on a diet of speeches from the Opposition. My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) raised the subject informally with the authorities—the keeper of the tapes, or whatever his designation is. He was assured that if the cameras returned, the windows would be treated with an appropriate substance which would obviate the need for screens. I accepted that assurance, but it has not been honoured, and we have the screens. Occasionally I like to descend on the Government Front Bench spokesman with criticisms, and I like to do so out of the sun. As the screens are here I cannot do that. Shall we have to sit without natural light in the mornings for the next two months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem for the television authorities is that if the screens are not there, those on the Back Benches cannot be seen. I shall make further enquiries, but the experiment is being carried out under the authority of the House, which has given responsibility to the appropriate Select Committee. I shall make informal enquiries and come back to the Committee later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. You will recall that on Tuesday, before the discussion on the Floor of the House, I gave you an undertaking that 1 should not disrupt the proceedings of the Committee, and I shall stick to that undertaking as I always do. But I want to raise the matter of what has happened in Scotland in the past 48 hours. The Scottish media have persisted in asking the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), to answer the question that I asked him in Committee on Tuesday. He has refused—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That matter cannot be considered now. The hon. Member must refrain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I ask formally that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland remove himself from the proceedings on the Committee —[Hon. Members: "Ratting!"]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not in order. It is not consistent with the hon. Member's undertaking, I must therefore move sharply to the next business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I which to bring to your attention a letter that some members of the Committee have received from an organisation called the National Health Service Supporters Party. I have no idea what the party consists of. The letter is dated "as Postmark" and is from 13 Main Avenue, Peterston-Super-Ely, Cardiff. It refers to the Bill and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"As a Standing Committee Member you have a unique opportunity to show sensivity to public opinion and to work hard to remove the damaging proposals in this Bill".</p></blockquote>
In the final paragraph it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Your activities on this Committee will be closely monitored. The NHSSP will ensure that the electorate in your constituency is fully informed on your activities."</p></blockquote>
I have consulted many interest groups in my constituency, and I write two newspaper columns a week informing my constituents of my activities. Is not the letter an implied threat that if Conservative Committee members do not act according to the wishes of the National Health Service Supporters party— whatever that is—information implying that we are not doing our public duty will be circulated?<br><br>
Should not the letter be examined, either by you, Dame Janet, as Chairman, or by the Privileges Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member feels aggrieved, he should raise the matter with the Privileges Committee. It is not for me to deal with the matter, which I hope will now be closed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) described Peterston-Super-Ely as being in Cardiff. In fact, it is in the Vale of Glamorgan, where during the by-election in 1989, the Labour party candidate, now the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan, successfully campaigned on the Health Service, about which there was strong feeling. The warning was given to the hon. Member, and to all Conservative Members, by the electorate of Vale of Glamorgan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. May we inquire, through you, whether Opposition Committee members received a similar letter, as that would have implications about the propriety of the letter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have ruled that it is not for me to adjudicate upon the matter. Therefore, the Committee may not dicuss it further. Hon. Members should take it up with the Privileges Committee.</span></p>

REGIONAL AND DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 17, at end insert —
<br><blockquote><p> (6) Each regional and district health authority shall consist of no less than 40 per cent. of women.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(7) In appointing chairmen of regional and district health authorities, the Secretary of State shall ensure that in the country as a whole at least 40 per cent. shall be women:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(8) In appointing chairmen and members of regional and district health authorities the Secretary of State shall ensure that there are on each district and regional health authority the same proportion of people from ethnic minority groups as there are in the area covered by the Authority;</p></blockquote>

<br><blockquote><p>(10) A person will not be eligible to hold the office of chairman of a regional, district or special health authority if he or she has any financial interest in private health care.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Couchman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Amendment Nos. 57, 58, 59, 60, and 61 stand in the name of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), who is not present in Committee, as he is, I understand, unwell. Will they be moved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member who has tabled an amendment need not be present in Committee. Any Committe member may move an amendment that does not stand in his name. I hope that that clarifies the matter.<br><br>
With amendment No. 4, we may take the following amendments: No. 173, in page 2, line 17, at end add —

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 deals with district health authorities, which are important. Therefore, the amendments are important, and we hope that the Government will accept them.<br><br>
District health authorities are responsible for planning and managing health services locally, and under the Bill they will become even more important, because they will also be responsible for decisions about where patients are treated. Decision making will be taken from the patient and the general practitioner and given to the district health authority.<br><br>
The proposals are a severely retrograde step, as they will make district health authorities even less accountable, representative and sensitive to local communities. We have tabled the amendments to seek to ensure that the voice of local people is heard in the planning of services; that the voice of women is heard in an organisation that is to choose for the first time where they have their baby, and where they have their family planning services; that the voice of ethnic minorities is represented on the body that will choose their services. We have tabled the amendments because there is a drive towards privatising the Health Service, and because the Bill will allow a district
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
health authority to place contracts with private hospitals and clinics, as well as with local district health authorities—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady's speech again, but Conservative Members are having great difficulty hearing her. We do not want words that we would wish to robustly challenge to slip into <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Member was chatting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not chatting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have found from experience that no side has a monopoly of virtue in the matter. There is a difficulty in being heard in this Committee room, and I am sure that each hon. Member will bear that in mind when speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our worry is that the clause will knock local people off district health authorities, the important bodies that will plan their services. Women will be under-represented on the authorities.<br><br>
We worry that district health authorities will not reflect the needs of the ethnic minorities, whom they are supposed to serve. Business men from outside the area will be bussed in to manage the local health authorities—people who have no contact with the communities that need the services.<br><br>
We have tabled an amendment on a further major worry, which is that district health authorities will no longer be responsible only for providing services for people in their area. They will be required to place contracts for those services. The authorities will be able to place contracts not just with their own, or neighbouring local hospitals, but with private hospitals and clinics. Therefore, we are worried that district health authorities will be run by people who have a vested financial interest in those private hospitals and clinics which will profit from the contracts placed by district health authorities.<br><br>
The amendments would be an important step forward, making district health authorities more locally sensitive and more representative of the needs and interests of ethnic minorities and women. The amendments represent a move forward, and are vital because of the Bill's proposals to make district health authorities more powerful, giving individual patients and GPs less choice and less opportunity to decide.<br><br>
10.45<br><br>
I cannot deal with all the amendments in this large group because they cover many specific issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) will deal with the representation of women on the new district health authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), who has been a member of his local area health authority, will emphasise the importance of local representation on district health authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) will deal, as one might guess, with the private financial vested interests of those who will serve on district health authorities.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr Michael) will deal with the representation

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
of community health councils on district health authorities. It is important to hear the consumer's voice on the district health authority, which is responsible for planning these services. The Government have paid lip service to consumerism, but in the Bill, for the first time, community health councils will lose their right to representation on the district health authority. We hope that the Government will see the sense in the amendment that we have proposed; my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth will discuss it in more detail.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) will discuss the representation of disabled people, who use the Health Service more than most people do. Their voice ought to be heard in planning and choosing the services on which they depend.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) will discuss the representation that ethnic minorities should have on district health authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As one would expect, the hon. Lady has given a long list of those who work in the Health Service whom the Labour party seeks to represent in the Committee. Who on her side will speak on behalf of the patients?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has suffered from not hearing a word that I have said, and I am clearly partly to blame for that. We are suggesting that those who use and depend on the services should be given the opportunity for their voices to be heard in planning the services and in deciding where to place contracts. I have not yet had time to mention an amendment, which we have tabled unashamedly, that provides for medical and nursing representation on district health authorities. Those authorities can benefit from the valuable experience of doctors, nurses and others who work in the service. There is nothing to be ashamed of in listening to people who have experience; it is common sense.<br><br>
We want health authorities to reflect the consumers' voice, through community health councils, the views of professional medical organisations and those working in the Health Service, and the views of the local people—women, ethnic minorities and the disabled. We do not want the district health authorities to be turned into boards of businessmen who run and manage the service like a business, especially if they run it in their own business interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady tell us roughly how large she thinks the authorities would need to be in order to accommodate each of the interests involved? Conservative Members are worried that the need for executive action will be overwhemed by the need to consult all the people that Labour Members want represented on the committees. I do not believe that such representation is workable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We framed the amendment in this way so that better executive action would result. Executive action is only as good as the planning and decisions that executives and management have to carry out, and we want the right decisions to be made. We therefore want the people using the service to be involved at the outset, not just at the receiving end. We also want a district health authority that is properly staffed and fully representative.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
I shall use the example of women on district health authorities to explain to hon. Members who may not understand why this matters. District health authorities plan services and are responsible for staffing them. To obtain the most effective and responsive services for women, they must play a part in planning those services. Suppose that an antenatal service is under-used and the women in its area are not attending the clinic for important antenatal tests and monitoring. The business man's district health authority might argue that there is no demand, that the clinic is surplus to requirements and that it should be closed because the consumers do not want it. However, people who understand the importance of these services and want to increase the take-up of antenatal care would examine the demand; they would say that perhaps the clinic is inaccessible, perhaps public transport does not serve it, perhaps the waiting time in the clinic is too long and perhaps it has no facilities for children. They might resolve to make those services more sensitive and more flexible and perhaps provide a play area or extend the opening hours.<br><br>
For the most effective and efficient service, it is critical to understand the views of those who will use it.<br><br>
We do not argue that men cannot play a role in that. We are merely trying to emphasise that to get the best and most effective service, the consumer's voice must be heard at the planning stage. That is even more important if the Bill is to succeed.<br><br>
The district health authority will make choices about health care which, at present, women make for themselves: a women chooses where to go to have her baby. If the Bill is enacted as drafted, that choice will be made by the district health authority. It is bad enough for a woman to have that choice taken away, but the decision being made by a bunch of business men would add insult to injury. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) shakes his head as if to say that the choice will not be removed. I assume, therefore, that he will vote with us on the amendment, which would ensure that, despite the NHS contract system, choice will remain for the consumer.<br><br>
I have one more example about the family planning services. Women can choose where to go for contraceptive services. If the facility is available, they can attend a clinic near their work or their home or they can go to the general practitioner committee—to their GP It is important for women to have access to family planning services. It is estimated that there are 250,000 unwanted and unplanned pregnancies each year. We should ensure that those services are available and are taken up.<br><br>
However, district health authorities, packed with business men, would say that only one clinic is needed in the area—or not even that, as women can go to their GPs. Of course, GPs are paid out of a separate budget and it would be cheaper for the DHA not to provide these services and to tell women to see their GPs. But if women were on the DHA and could have their say, they would probably point out that some women will not go to their GPs because, for example, they feel that their family doctor is too close to home.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr Roger Freeman)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
hon. Lady's argument with great care. She will probably appreciate that 35 per cent. of district health authority membership is made up of women. I did not follow her remarks about women being appointed to DHAs. Women already constitute one third of their membership.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To judge from an answer to a parliamentary question that I tabled, it seems that the Government do not collect figures of membership of district health authorities. The latest figures for membership of regional health authorities show a severe under-representation of women. The system is not perfect, but we fear that the changes proposed in the Bill will make it even worse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minster for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may finish my example about family planning; then I will come to the Under-Secretary's point, which no doubt the Minister for Health will follow up.<br><br>
Businessmen would argue, "We can do without a budget for this. We can send these women to the GP." But the problem is that many women would not then go for contraceptive services. The general practitioner might be too close to home or have no contraceptive training. Many do not. The woman might have the pill dished out or an intra-uterine device fitted by someone who is not trained to do it. The result will be that she will never go back to that doctor.<br><br>
There must be a consumer voice in the choice and planning of services or they will be underused and their important, preventive nature undermined. My hon. Friends will further develop those arguments. I shall intervene in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax when I have had time to check the figures given in answers to my parliamentary questions. I shall respond then to the Minsiter's point about the precise percentage of women on district health authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Ann Widdecombe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maidstone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer to amendment No. 4 which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Each regional and district health authority shall consist of no less than 40 per cent. of women".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"In appointing chairmen of regional and district authorities, the Secretary of State shall ensure that . . at least 40 per cent. shall be women".</p></blockquote>
That is patronising and insulting. I am appalled by the reasons advanced by the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman). Her reason for appointing women to the authorities is not because they will manage well or take good decisions, but because they have a specific interest in maternity services, for example. I have never heard an argument advanced for putting a man on a health authority because he knows about hernias and prostates.<br><br>
The Opposition do not suggest that we should try to ensure a fair representation of women but set a specific percentage—40 per cent. Let us suppose that the Secretary of State were recommended to appoint as chairman of a health authority a man who had excellent qualifications, a good knowledge of the area and a long record of service. If the amendment were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
accepted, he would be told, "Sorry, the person appointed must be a woman because the percentage has dropped to 38.2 per cent." It is very silly and tokenist to state a percentage.<br><br>
The reasoning is fallacious—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is possible that if the percentage fell to 38.2 per cent. the constitution would become illegal? In that event the district or regional health authority may not be able to carry out its functions in accordance with the statute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what the amendment implies. If it were enshrined in law, a health authority would have at least 40 per cent. of women members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member of Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), would it be the case that if a member of a health authority were to die, it would immediately trigger the re-proportioning of the membership? Indeed, if someone were to die before thoughtfully notifying the authority, every act thereafter would be ultra vires.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be the effect. It would take up a disproportionate amount of time because authorities would be more concerned about monitoring their membership percentages than about doing the job.<br><br>
The fallacy of the Oppositions reasoning is that women must be appointed not because they are able, or because they can manage well—we certainly can—but because they have special knowledge. In that case, why not appoint a percentage of pensioners, of children, of people requiring hip operations or of the mentally ill? Why not include a percentage of every group with specific health requirements? It is poor reasoning to say that because women might need certain facilities they must be represented? Why should a single woman be any more able to take about family planning and maternity services than a married man whose wife has had children? He will know about local maternity services, so that point is based on an absolute fallacy.<br><br>
We need a body of people to work out the needs of the local area, understand what can be best provided and take into account the valid points made by the hon. Member for Peckham about contraceptives, determining what should be provided locally, whether a GP or a clinic is required and so on. Women are not uniquely qualified to pronounce on such things. Although I believe that women should be represented, as they are, trying to tie the figure down to 40 per cent. and saying that a woman must be present to represent womens' interests is an insult.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
A woman is chairman of our district health authority. She is second to none. She knows that she was appointed because she is second to none and an able manager with a deep respect for the community as well as the health department. Under this proposal, no woman who is appointed would have that confidence. She would be appointed as a token.<br><br>
The amendment is anti-feminist, anti-woman, thoroughly patronising and shoddy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall talk
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
specifically about amendment No. 4, particularly subsection (9), which relates to people holding office who live outside the district or regional hospital area and, more specifically, to the chair. My comments will relate not only to chairs of the authority but also to the membership. I certainly do not believe that people who live outside health authority areas should be allowed to serve on regional or district health authority committees.<br><br>
I feel strongly about this issue. Throughout its history, the Wakefield district health authority has frequently made odd decisions and it has never had a chair resident within the area. I suspect that that is deliberate. I am resentful because I am sure that there are many able people living within the area served by the district health authority in my constituency who would do a first class job as chairs and represent the real interest of the Health Service consumer.<br><br>
What is interesting in my area is the way in which the constitution of the health authority is profoundly unrepresentative. I suspect that the Bill's provisions will make that lack of representation markedly worse. When I was a member of the health authority in Wakefield I did a little research and found that nearly half the membership lived in only one of the 63 electoral wards in the Wakefield district. I am sure that it was pure coincidence that that one ward was the only ward in the Wakefield district that elected Conservative councillors, but that is how unrepresentative the Wakefield health authority was and is.<br><br>
Further research when I was a member showed that only one member of the health authority lived in a council house. At that time, 50 per cent. of the people living in the Wakefield health authority are a lived in council houses. That was profoundly unrepresentative.<br><br>
I believe that democracy in the Health Service should become a front-line political issue at the next general election. People should have the right to vote for those who take decisions about their health. There can be fewer more important decisions in life than those taken about personal health or the health of members of the family. Why should we not have a direct democratic election to decide who represents our health interests and takes important decisions about the Health Service at local level?<br><br>
I am also worried about the way in which certain interests have been allowed to permeate health authority structures. For example, a huge package of cuts was delivered to the health authority on which I served resulting from the Government's paring back resources for the National Health Service. They were moved by a consultant who had a direct interest in private medicine, was directly involved with a private hospital and stood to gain from a longer waiting list and people queue jumping and having to go for private health care. That is profoundly wrong and we must do something about it as a matter of urgency.<br><br>
I shall be brief because my hon. Friends wish to speak on this important matter. Health Authorities sometimes make rather odd decisions which reflect the fact that there is no local consumer involvement. I cite my own health authority as an example, although perhaps it is not typical.<br><br>
A little while ago, my health authority considered a paper that proposed fining patients who failed to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
attend out-patient clinics for appointments. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) spoke about the reason patients do not attend for those appointments. Young mothers or fathers with children often have to try to care for two to three hours for young children who race about and play. Many clinics have no play facilities for them.<br><br>
Another aspect, which I imagine the highly-paid unit general manager who made the proposal missed, was the way in which people lose money because of having to attend for out-patient appointments. My father used to lose a day's pay when, for many years, he had to attend a Leeds hospital to receive treatment for a long-standing health problem. That is often forgotten. My father was a low-paid worker. We should consider these issues and ensure that consumers represent low-paid workers so that their problems are taken into account when decisions are made.<br><br>
I hope to receive today an answer from the Minister to a parliamentary question that I tabled recently. It came to my attention last week that Wakefield health authority was levying a £5 charge on the families of people who had died and whose bodies were in Wakefield mortuary. I was alerted to this by a local undertaker who told me that in future when a body is measured by a hospital mortuary attendant, a £5 charge is to be made to the undertaker. This will, of course, be passed on to the families as a disbursement. So Wakefield health authority is to levy a charge on bereaved families. That is the depth that we have reached. My argument is that if ordinary people were involved, that would not happen.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham and I served on the Standing Committee of the Health and Medicines Bill in 1988. We thought of all sorts of odd things that would come from devolved fund-raising powers—car parks, flower shops and so on. Never in our wildest dreams did we suspect that health authorities would be so insensitive as to levy a charge on bereaved families. I hope that the Minister will view this as seriously as I do and take action to stop the charge.<br><br>
I will not pursue these issues save to say that I feel strongly that ordinary people—the consumers—should have a right to involvement in the running of their Health Service. I hope that in future we shall have a fully democratic Health Service in which people vote at elections for the sort of health care and local services that they need and deserve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments, though formal in shape, range widely into the principle of our proposals. I plan, Dame Janet, to leave for an engagement before the debate ends. I hope that you will acquit me of any discourtesy, but I feel that it is worth putting a few points on record now.<br><br>
The first, although germane to the amendments, arises from remarks made the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) at the somewhat hurried close of our debate on Tuesday evening. I have studied the report of his comments and mine. He said that I seemed to oppose the amendment then under discussion—which I did—and that I was opposing the entire Bill. I was puzzled at the time. I remain puzzled after studying the record of what I said. I cannot see how what I said could possibly be taken as opposing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0401">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
the principle of the Bill. For the benefit of any doubt, I do not oppose it; I am here to improve it.<br><br>
On this morning's exchanges, I refer briefly to the comments of the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman), who was kind enough to give way to me once but declined to do so a second time. I speculated about the size of the health authorities required for the representation a purpose that she wanted, but I received no answer. Because of these representational difficulties in the Opposition amendments, I hope that my hon. Friends will resist them.<br><br>
The difficulty with the clutch of Opposition amendments, which are wrecking proposals, is that they seek to pursue some sort of ideal world in which the Health Service is said to be representative of "ordinary people". That is an attractive concept. I want the Health Service to be neither unrepresentative of ordinary people nor incapable of serving them. I thought the hon. Member for Peckham had a strange idea of business. She said that businesses might overlook services that they might provide for commercial reasons. My experience of business is that it is precisely those businesses that spot commercial opportunities—discovering that services are not provided and setting out to provide them—that succeed. I hope that that approach will help the Health Service.<br><br>
The underlying misconception seems to be that representation of the people, the consumers of services, must depend on complete representation in committees. As I have said, that is a will o' the wisp; it is not possible.<br><br>
I have always felt that the following is a safe example, although no doubt someone will write to me to say that it is not. Let us take the case of left-handed taxidermists. It is not possible for their interests—if they exist—to be represented on health committees, any more than they can be in the business world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept a single fact before he goes into further silly trivialisation of the serious issue of under-representation? Women in this country represent more than 50 per cent. of the population; I doubt whether taxidermists of any kind amount to 1 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why I choose the example. I have a special interest in women's interests because women happen to make up 80 per cent. of my household. I have wife and three daughters and I and my hon. Friends are just as committed as is the hon. Lady to the promotion of women's rights. The question is whether we must have a statutory percentage of women—a major and influential group—or any individual group on the committees.</span></p>
<p>[<i>Interruption</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. A certain amount of chattering seems to be going on. Wherever it comes from, I deplore it, especially when it makes it difficult for met to hear to the person who has the floor who is entitled to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you, Dame Janet. I do not think that it is either necessary or always the best course of action to have the population precisely proportionaly represented on an authority.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
My second point concerns the belief that the only way for interest groups to get their views across is through membership. That cannot happen either. But is possible for people to make representations— indeed, that is why there are people in the Public Gallery today. Such representations will continue to be possible. The fact that they are making them out with membership means that they are not bound by the collective responsibility that membership would impose. If people want to criticise their district health authority, they can do so. The ultimate test is one of accountability, through the Governmment to the electorate, together with the consumers' and patients eventual verdicts on whether the new structure provide patients' requirements. I believe that, by and large, they will.<br><br>
I am anxious to get across the case for these important interests. I do not believe the point made by the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) but I doubt whether it is necessary to build those interests into the formal structure of representation.<br><br>
On a lighter note, I conclude with two sayings that my old father, who was very much a farmer, left me, and which I often quote. There seems to be dangers in almost anything we do in public affairs. My father's first maxim was that it is no good hiring a dog and barking oneself. The right course of action is to appoint authorities—I do not equate them with dogs—to see how they get on, and to be critical of them.<br><br>
Secondly, he often used to say—and this is more directly agricultural—that it is no use going out to cut the crop only to find that it has not been planted. I fear that if we encumber the Health Service with over-elaborate tiers of consultation built into the system, as opposed to the most effective forms of consultation which are often outwith the system and informal, the objective which we all seek, which is to represent patients' interests, will fail. It will not be furthered by the amendments.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said that he wants to improve the Bill. As the condemned man might say as he stands on the scaffold, "You may impriove the method of execution, but there is only one inevitable outcome and it does not meet my direct personal interests." The British public regard the Bill in much the same spirit.<br><br>
Far from offering wrecking amendments, we have tabled a series of amendments that would to some extent —it is difficult to do this—make the Bill rational, reasonable and representative in its operations.<br><br>
I question the Government's interest in and concern to have a consumer voice in the Health Service. I question their intention of having proper scrutiny of how the Health Services will operate in future. If they are serious about either of those matters, they will accept some of our amendments and change the ethos of their approach to the Health Service.<br><br>
Community health councils are meant to represent the communities which comprise the consumers of the Health Service. If CHCs are effectively to represent communities' interests within the NHS, they must take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
on an advocacy role in respect of the users of services, both collectively and individually. That is a tremendous role to undertake and they should be given the authority, powers and representation to make it possible.<br><br>
The advocacy role necessarily requires that CHCs are, and are seen to be, independent. They must be able to provide an external validation of the NHS's own work in quality control. That is to apply the language of management to CHCs. But to do that job properly, they require representation on the district and regional health authorities. They need independence and resources because proper independence cannot exist without the necessary resources. They must be representative of the whole community.<br><br>
Wales does not have a separate regional authority. In effect, the Welsh Office is the regional authority. The Welsh authority decides on the establishment of the CHCs. We have a keen wish in Wales to retain our representation of the community. I have spoken to doctors about this. The British Medical Association in Wales regards the local CHC, which covers a much smaller area than the county-wide area proposed in the Government's consultative document, as most important. If CHCs are to be on a county-wide basis, as the Welsh Office appears to want, it is feared that local medical committees will lose the opportunity to relate to a body that represents the local community.<br><br>
That is the view of managers; doctors are managers. The individual general practioner is the manager of his patients' interests and his practice. Conservative Members should take managers' views into account when considering the future of CHCs.<br><br>
I am sure that there are good reasons why the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is not here today. But I regret his absence, I should have liked to hear his response to this most important matter, especially to the aspects affecting Wales.<br><br>
The document from the Welsh Office, which demands responses by 28 February, when the Bill will not yet have gone through Parliament, cannot be termed a consultative document. It is certainly not the review of CHCs which was originally promised for Wales. There has been no review of the effectiveness or quality of work of CHCs in Wales. I am not aware of such work being undertaken in the United Kingdom generally. That reflects the Government's lack of interest in the representation of communities and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is unavoidably detained on other official business. I undertake to draw the hon. Gentleman's remarks to my hon. Friend's attention, and no doubt at the appropriate time a response will be given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Minister's absence is to do with the Health Service. That demonstrates that the Bill is regarded as less important than other matters. I received no explanation before today of the Minister's absence, which would have been the usual courtesy. But I am sure that he is attending to important issues because he is not someone who would waste his time. Given the importance of the amendments, I regret that he is not here today, but I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
am grateful for the Under-Secretary of State's undertaking.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State for Wales might have been able to tell us why there has been no proper evaluation of the work of CHCs, especially as the Welsh Office is to regard CHCs as patient representatives in the new pattern of the NHS in the 1990s.<br><br>
The Welsh Office document is merely a proposal for a change from 22 CHCs in Wales to nine. It is not a review of their work and it does not contain a proper analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of what exists now or of what we should have in future.<br><br>
There is no such thing as a coherent voice of the consumer or the community, as seemed to be suggested. The public will always have a variety of views on any topic. It is not the CHCs role to reconcile those conflicting views, although the consultative documents suggests that it should be. CHCs should ensure that the views of all sections of the community are expressed, to enable the policy-makers to reach their decisions. It is often very clear what the community wants from the Health Service. The community voice should be and remain clear and not be diffused in the way proposed.<br><br>
There is no sign that CHCs will be able to attend, even as observers, the meetings of new-style health authorities or FPSA boards. That is an important point of principle. Strengthening the community voice by reducing the number of CHCs in Wales is a contradiction in terms. There is no evidence to suggest that one CHC per county in Wales will give a clearer and stronger focus to the informed consumer voice than do the present 22 CHCs. Indeed, the opposite is true.<br><br>
No formal status is to be given to the Welsh Association of Community Health Councils. That is an important omission, given that there is no regional health authority and that the Welsh Office performs that function.<br><br>
Perhaps I may cite a couple of examples of important representation of community. In my area, the Sully and Llandough hospitals are extremely important and popular, two of the most popular in the country. Sully, which is in a superb setting, is threatened with closure. The whole community, across party divisions and community boundaries in the area, believes that the hospital should remain open.<br><br>
The Vale community health council set up a working party to take hearings and listen to the professionals in every sphere and level of the Health Service, such as doctors and those involved in rehabilitative and community medicine. It put forward proposals about its future, which I believe will be accepted in time by the health authority. But that could not be done if the body were not representative of an identifiable community. It is nonsense to merge it into a community health council to cover south Glamorgan. It is even greater nonsense to have one CHC for the whole of Dyfed, or the whole of Powys, which is 100 miles across, or the whole of Gwynedd.<br><br>
The consultative document needs to be re-thought, abandoned and then re-set: there needs to be a system that allows proper representation of CHCs on district and, in England, regional health authorities. At the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
root of the issue there is a basic failure to recognise the nature of community. It derives from the Prime Minister's dogmatic view that the community does not even exist. The 1972 community review recognised communities as identifiable by the people who live in them, but there is a failure now to understand that basic concept.<br><br>
Conservative Members believe that district health authorities are not sufficiently representative, but disabled people cannot be dealt with on a county-wide basis. Access and transport imperatives have a direct relevance to their interests, and require community input. Ethnic minorities have special interests. In my community—the docks—sickle-cell anaemia is prevalent among certain ethnic communities. We need the community health council, with its knowledge of the community and, for instance, its knowledge of the disabilities that occur in those parts of the valleys represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and others, where post-industrial disability and illness occur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If the Government do not recognise the importance of such things, it is clear that they intend to move away from patient-based and community-based services, which we support; that they do not trust the community; that they do not trust people; and they do not trust democratic involvement in the provision and management of services.<br><br>
The amendments dealing with the representation of the community, through community health councils, on regional and district health authorities in England are of fundamental importance, and the Government should accept them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment gives an opportunity to discuss the composition of the proposed new health authorities, but the Opposition rather spoil their case by producing a long list of bodies that they feel should be represented on them. It is important that representative bodies and interests should be consulted before appointments are made, but that they should all be represented on the authorities is unrealistic. In the course of the debate I hope that we shall draw out the Government's thinking on how the new authorities will be appointed and who they expect to be appointed to them. I hope, too, that we shall be told about the probable size of the health authorities.<br><br>
The White Paper talked about the authorities comprising five executives, five non-executive members and one chairman, but I can find no reference in the Bill to the size of the authorities. Presumably, that is within the regulation-making power. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister can tell us whether the Government's thinking is still in line with the White Paper, or whether it has shifted.<br><br>
Existing authorities are required to include in their membership a hospital consultant, a general practitioner, a nurse and, when appropriate, a nominee from a university medical school. The Bill very much involves clinicians in management, an involvement which, I believe, they welcome, but at present they are involved
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
specifically in the health authorities. In theory, under the present drafting of the Bill, it would be possible for a health authority to be so constituted that it included no one with any medical knowledge or experience.<br><br>
My understanding is that most district managers and authority chairmen would welcome a medical presence on the authority. Paragraph 8.6 of the White Paper says that
<br><blockquote><p>"Non-executive members will be appointed solely on the basis of the skills and experience they can bring to the authority",</p></blockquote>
and that sentiment will, I feel sure, be warmly supported by all Conservative Members. But I assume—I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that I am right—that that is bound to include medical skills and experience. I suggest that before the Secretary of State makes appointments to the authority, he consults the representative professional bodies, and includes clinicians, the director of public health—as he is to be called—and university representation, where appropriate.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman advocating that a list should be made of bodies and individuals to be contacted before the appointments are made? If so, where do they start and where do they end? Do they include some of the agencies and bodies that we have mentioned in the amendments? Or will they be plucked from the air by the Minister when the appointments are made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not have thought that it was necessary to make a list; indeed, I should be surprised if it did not exist already in the Department of Health. Clearly, the Department of Health knows the organisations, the professional bodies and the representative bodies, and if any were not consulted, I suspect that they would make their presence known.<br><br>
I referred a moment ago to medical school representation. Paragraph 8.6 of the White Paper tells us:
<br><blockquote><p>"Teaching Districts will continue to include someone drawn from the medical school."</p></blockquote>
Again, there is nothing in the Bill about that. There is an interesting reference at page 88 of the White Paper in paragraph 11.19:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State will continue to appoint at least one member to each authority in Wales from the University of Wales College of Medicine."</p></blockquote>
Again, that does not appear in the Bill, and there is no reference in the White Paper or anywhere else to any other universities. It seems that the University of Wales has been singled out to ensure that it is represented on health authorities.<br><br>
It would be fair to say, I think that the medical profession has not greeted the White Paper and the Bill with unalloyed enthusiasm. One expects the Opposition on principle to oppose any Bill of this sort that is introduced by the Government, but certain professional bodies have done themselves little credit by the campaigns of misrepresentation that they have conducted against the Bill—in some cases, descending to personal abuse. Much as I should like to examine in detail some of the literature that they have issued, I shall not be tempted to do so, or point out how
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
incorrect and misleading it is. But some of the professional bodies that I have in mind now seem to have accepted that the Government intend to proceed — rightly, in my view — with the measure, and they are taking a more constructive approach. I am afraid, however, that many members of the medical profession remain the victim of their own self-induced concern about the implications of the proposed reforms, and I suggest that some of their concern would be much allayed if they knew that they had colleagues sitting on the regional and district health authorities.<br><br>
I do not know whether it has escaped your notice, Dame Janet, that in talking about organisations and individuals who should be on the health authority, one group is specifically precluded from sitting on health authorities: Members of Parliament. They are excluded in clause 53. In my view, that is unfortunate. It is unikely, of course, that many Members of Parliament would be able to serve on health authorites, but the Committee has already been told by my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) that before he entered the House he was the chairman of a health authority. Other hon. Members have similar experience. My erstwhile colleague Sir David Crouch, who was a member of a regional health authority and an MP made a valuable contribution to discussions.<br><br>
On the subject. I suspect that Members are excluded because of the proposal that non-executive members of health authorities can be given a remuneration. That difficulty could be overcome if sitting Members of Parliament who became members of health authorities did not receive payment. I shall not dwell on the isue; it is unfortunate that the provision is included. We may hear more about it under clause 53.<br><br>
The details of appointments to health authorities will presumably be made by regulation. The notes on clauses gives details of those who will be appointed to the family practitioner services authorities. However, there is no such guidance in respect of health authorities.<br><br>
I accept that specifying membership in the Bill would restrict the Secretary of State's scope in making appointments, but some of my arguments remain valid. I hope that the Minster's reply will give further guidance on the type of appointments that will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Mon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak to amendments Nos. 217 and 218, which refer to the membership of district health authorities in Wales. I speak, too, to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), who is ill and unable to be here.<br><br>
The Government's official approach to membership of the new-style managements of district health authorities is set out in page 65 of the White Paper "Working for Patients". I quote from paragraph 8.5 of that document, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government believes that authorities based on this confusion of roles would not be equipped to handle the complex managerial and contractual issues that the new system of matching resources to performance will demand."</p></blockquote>
That is the official reason for the changes. The real reason is that local authority representatives who are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
nominated to district health authorities at present will not do as they are told by the Government-appointed chairman and nominate members. For example, when district health authorities face cuts or ward or hospital closures at the end of the financial year—it happened in my area—local authority representatives may not always follow the chairmans' and nominated members' line. They may believe that other issues must be considered and want to argue against the implementation of cuts.<br><br>
In other words, they could not be trusted to carry out the Government's instructions.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) mentioned the White Paper, which gives some idea of the membership of new authorities. There will be a total of up to 11, including five executive and five non-executive members and a chairman. The executive members will include the general manager and the finance director. The non-executive members will be appointed solely on the basis of their skills and expertise, with which my hon. Friends and I agree. We want appointments to the authorities to be based on skills and expertise, but as the hon. Gentleman said, the Bill is deliberately vague in that respect.<br><br>
Section 3(1) of schedule I, part I states:
<br><blockquote><p>A District Health Authority for a district in Wales shall consist of—
<ol>
<li>a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State:</li>
<li>a prescribed number of members appointed by him:</li>
<li>the chief officer of the authority:</li>
<li>such other officers as may be prescribed: and</li>
<li>not more than a prescribed number of other officers of the authority appointed by the chairman and the members specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) above.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
That is a nice little club, a neat and tidy arrangement. The Secretary of State can pick his friends and his friends can pick their friends. The health authorities in Wales will be nice little cocoons consisting of place-men and women and yes-men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will mean the continuation of the present iniquitous series of cabals that comprise the controlling bodies of quangos in Wales. They were all appointed by the present Secretary of State for Wales or by his predecessor. Nearly all of them come from castles somewhere in the proximity of Usk. That is deplorable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent and valid contribution. My hon. Friend is right. Those appointed will be friends and colleagues, people who can be trusted and who, to use a well-know phrase, are "one of us". They need consult no one.<br><br>
The Minister would not accept an amendment to consult in a previous sitting. Business will be carried out with the usual wink and nod.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us where is Usk and who lives in the castle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a facile point. The gentleman to whom the hon. Member for Pontypridd referred is the Lord Crickhowell. The hon. Gentleman should know that he was appointed to chair the National Rivers Authority.<br><br>
The Bill will not bring democracy and participation to the Health Service. It will result in the negation of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
democracy. What about participation? What about listening to the patient? What about the patient's voice on district health authorities in Wales?<br><br>
As I said on Second Reading, the new structure of district health authorities in Wales and England is designed to enable a future Conservative Government to privatise the Health Service. When their own people are nominated onto those bodies, it will be one step away. I realise that the Government say that they do not want to privatise the Health Service, but privatisation will be only one step away.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Community health councils say that they will be even more remote from patients as a result of the changes. If we read the report of what the press call the Tory-dominated social services Committee, we see that some Tory Members are unhappy about the way in which district health authorities will be appointed. Paragraph 5(32) of its Eighth Report, "Resourcing the National Health Service" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is curious that the White Paper whose objective is working for patients' and improving the responsiveness of the service to local needs should remove elements of local accountability rather than strengthen them. We believe that DHAs should not act simply as local agencies of RHAs. If they are to be able to fulfil their public health role in identifying local needs and planning services accordingly, as well as responding to the needs and wishes of their resident population, some form of local representation must be retained."</p></blockquote>
That sentiment should be shared by the Committee and by the Government in accepting some of the amendments. It encapsulates the Opposition's view of the membership of the new district health authorities in Wales and England.<br><br>
As well as local authority representatives, there should be representatives of the medial profession, as the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) said, and representatives of nurses and of voluntary groups, for the reasons that were advanced during our previous sitting. The community care proposals mean that voluntary organisations will have far more responsibility for discharging community care to the elderly and the disabled. Surely they should have an input into strategic planning within district health authorities.<br><br>
I listened with great care to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who said that one need not be a member of a health authority to make one's views known. That is right. Members of Parliament are not members of district health authorities, but we make our views known. The authorities may take our views into account, but they need not implement them. We are not part of the decision-making process. The amendments do not seek to make Members of Parliament part of that process. But people with valid concerns should be part of it; not part of the consultation, but able to listen to the arguments, put forward their views and vote on such issues. It is the difference between sending a letter, which can often be thrown in the dustbin, and being there to vote on issues that affect patients whether they be disabled, elderly, or whatever.<br><br>
Politics is a matter of priorities. The Labour party's priority is to have people on the district health authorities who can make valid contributions, who represent the interest of doctors, nurses and patients, and who take part in the decision-making process. That is preferable to the chance procedure, embodied in the Bill, by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
which the Secretary of State hopes to appoint the best person merely by appointing whomever he likes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alic Mahon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to the part of the amendment dealing with the representation of women on health authorities. The Government have a unique opportunity to signal that they recognise the massive under-representation of women on the authorities and that they intend to do something about it. If the Government give that signal, they will be following the advice of the Women's National Commission. That advisory group sent a useful report, entitled "Women and the Health Service", to the Cabinet in 1985. Its opinion is in accord with those of the hon. Members for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) and for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) and other hon. Members who have spoken this morning. The working group was chaired by Dame Ann Springman of the Conservative Women's National Committee, and included some prominent women who have proved themselves in many spheres of public life, even if they are not natural supporters of my party. They represented, for instance, the Royal College of Midwives, the British Federation of University Women, the Health Visitors' Association, the Medical Women's Federation, and the Conservative Women's National Committee. On page 25 of the report it is recommended that
<br><blockquote><p>"those concerned with nominating and selecting individuals for appointment to Health Authorities and other consultative bodies should ensure that such bodies reflect the composition of the local population, and include a realistic representation of women."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will take that eminently sensible suggestion on board and ignore the remarks of her more reactionary colleagues.<br><br>
The report clearly recognises the massive under-representation of women in July 1989, only one of the 14 regional health authority chairpersons was a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Chairperson?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.<br><br>
Out of the 190 district health authority chairpersons only 31 were women. That is blatant inequality. I see that hon. Members are giggling like schoolboys. The Equal Opportunities Commission, which is also a Government body, stated in a report in 1988 that women comprise only 19 per cent. of all public bodies, only 9 per cent. of the nationalised industries, and only 21 per cent. of advisory bodies. If the Government accept this reasonable amendment, that obvious inequality will be redressed.<br><br>
It is important that there is fairer representation on the committees. As my hon. Friend for Peckham (Ms. Harman) has said, if they are set up they will become the major decision-makers and a great deal of choice will be taken away.<br><br>
The amendment is very important because throughout their lives, women come into contact with health services far more than men. That is a fact of life. Women use the services for maternity care, for the most part take children to the doctors, attend clinics with them and take babies when they need immunisation. Whether we like it or not, that is the job that women do.<br><br>
Women still take the major responsibility for contraception, and caring for the family and the elderly. They also liaise with GPs, health visitors and hospitals.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0406">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
Women live far longer than men and therefore constitute the majority of the elderly who need care later in life.<br><br>
It is true that in recent years the National Health Service has responded to the demands from women for more accessible services locally which fit in with their needs rather than having to fit in with the convenience of the service. We have seen the emergence of this on a small scale with the well-women's centres, which I welcome. That is the way forward—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchcliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am one of the few hon. Members here who, on his constituency premises, offers access to advice surgeries and pregnancy tests. I share an office, as my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) knows because she has been there, with the well-women's centre in Wakefield. Does my hon. Friend share my concern about the way in which the Government have failed to support this excellent development, which has given first-class service to women who previously missed out on many provisions within the Health Service? Will my hon. Friend urge the Minister to provide proper resources and to give priority to the work being done by well-women centres in many parts of the country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I accept that important contribution. The pregnancy testing in my constituency is done on a voluntary basis by women who have to go round with a begging bowl every 12 months to obtain money to fund the rent of premises. That is a well-used service and I hope that the Minister will take on board the point made by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Recent developments in medical practice have resulted in screening procedures for cervical and breast cancer that can detect disease early and increase the chance of cure, although progress has been patchy. These facilities, along with the well-women and pregnancy testing centres, are all now on the NHS agenda. These services are accepted by women, as basic requirements in any National Health Service. They do not consider them to be trivial. The Bill will set back the task of improving such initiatives for women by many years. It will reduce choice and threaten family planning and the abortion services, which are already patchy and inadequate. It will place further burdens on carers. I repeat, the vast majority of carers are women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In normal circumstances I would give way but I do not intend to give way on this vital subject for an important reason — [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It must be made clear that the Member who holds the Floor has an absolute right to decide whether to give way. That may not please other Members of the Committee but that is the right of the Member concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. If we were discussing any other subject I would certainly give way. I do not want to give way on this subject. I want to take the time available to me to talk about serious matters that concern women. I do not want to talk about left-handed taxidermists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Will you remind the hon. Lady that time is not limited in Committee? The idea is to provide the opportunity to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
have a sensible debate, which is what we all want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry that the hon. Member did not listen to what I said previously. I said that the Member who has the Floor has an absolute right to decide whether to give way irrespective of the wishes of other Committee Members. That must be respected. I do not expect to hear anything further on that point.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we increased women's representation on district and regional health authorities they would voice our concern because their lives will have touched on the issues that I have mentioned. They will have touched on caring for sick members of their families, maternity, family planning, gynaecology and abortion, for example. Women will automatically show sensitivity to the problems faced by women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am sorry.<br><br>
They will understand the problems of the women who have faced the 250,000 unplanned and regretted pregnancies that occur every year, many of which occur amongst teenagers. If there were more chairwomen making decisions about where to locate maternity services, we would not be faced with decisions to move them from one town to another. Women understand that women have other domestic responsibilities and that time taken travelling is vital when a woman is trailing to an antenatal, or postnatal, clinic by public transport because fewer women have their own transport than do men. They would not need a file of reports to tell them that.<br><br>
The Minister failed to give a commitment that maternity services would be included in the core services. In answer to a question from my hon. Friend on 25 May 1989, the Minister would not give that guarantee, which makes women's representation even more important. More women, and more local women, in senior positions would certainly fight for more choice in family planning services. Choice has recently been reduced in this vital service as cash-starved district health authorities have cut sessions in clinics in the hope that the expense of contraception can be shifted from the DHA's budget to the family practitioner services.<br><br>
The financial pressure of DHAs imposed by the capital charges in the Bill means that there will be a stampede to close vital family planning services. Women will cease to have the choice that they have now. I believe also that opted-out hospitals will lead to a fragmented maternity service to the detriment of women and people working in that service as a team—the midwives, doctors and helpers.<br><br>
I have already questioned the Minister in the House—she has now left the Committee—about the future for infertility services, which seems very uncertain now. That again touches women's lives greatly.<br><br>
I am anxious not to be selfish with time as other Committees Members wish to contribute. I wish merely to ask the Minister to take the amendment seriously and respond to the good recommendations contained in the Women's National Commission on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0407">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
representation. Women constitute more than 50 per cent. of the population and are the major users of health services. It is a tragedy that one of the few women Ministers, the Minister for Health, could not stay to hear the end of the debate. I am disappointed.<br><br>
Given that the National Health Service is important to women throughout their lives, I hope that the amendment is taken seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be petty but I think that the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) mouthed "frit" the other day when I would not give way for the third time during my speech and when I had even given way to her. I think it would have been gracious if the hon. Lady had given way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall not give way yet, as I have not really begun. I merely express the hope that the Committee will be treated more courteously in future than it was by the previous speaker.<br><br>
I am worried by amendment No. 4, which is the principal amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and his colleagues, because it seems to set the scene for women's sections, black sections, and many other sections on comparatively small management bodies. I should point out that 40 per cent. of an 11-member health authority would be more than four members. Five members would be 45 per cent. of the authority. In an extremely effective contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) said that it would be a patronising way of selecting people to serve on health authorities. I want people to be appointed to health authorities who will bring their skills and experience rather than represent a sectional interest. The amendment is deeply flawed in respect of appointments from members of ethnic minorities because it requires that on each district or regional health authority
<br><blockquote><p>"the same proportion of people from ethnic minority groups as there are in the area covered by the Authority"</p></blockquote>
shall be appointed as chairmen or members of that authority. The statistics are not available to allow such appointments to be made. We must remember that regions and districts are not necessarily coterminous with local authority boundaries. That has been a long-standing problem, but it is unlikely that we shall be able to make them so. The amendment is flawed on that ground alone.<br><br>
Amendment No. 4 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person will not be eligible to hold the office of chairman of a regional or district authority if he or she does not live within the area covered by that authority."</p></blockquote>
That is a further flaw. I was chairman of a district health authority, but did not live within that district. I was also chairman of the social services committee of the local authority, which has a coterminous boundary, but I did not live there. I lived in the neighbouring borough. I lived, however, within the area of the principal general hospital of the district, to which I was appointed. Therefore, I was a consumer of that district's services as are my family. Neither my family nor I have been contributors to private health care, we are National Health Service patients and always have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
been. Therefore, the amendment is too tightly drawn.<br><br>
It is entirely desirable that both chairmen and members of health authorities have a strong connection with the area of the district or region to which they are appointed. The amendment is too narrowly drawn, however, because it would disfranchise those who live outwith the district health authority boundary but within the catchment area of its principal hospitals. For instance, the mental hospital in my district served four London boroughs. All the people in those boroughs had a vested interest in that facility and could reasonably be expected to be appointed to that district health authority. They would be disfranchised under the amendment, which is nonsensical especially as the hospital is not within the health authority's area. The amendment is deeply flawed, and we should not hesitate to throw it out. To prevent anyone with a financial interest in private health care from becoming chairman would preclude almost every consultant, as many of them divide their time between the National Health Service and private practice.<br><br>
I do not disagree with the other amendments about retaining the role of the community health councils, and I am slightly disappointed that the Bill makes little mention of the councils. They went through a difficult formation period in the mid-1970s, and I should like them to continue their role now that they are mature. They genuinely represent the interests of the patient and the consumer, and they have built up valuable relationships with the district health authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we are especially fortunate in the interest shown by the Medway community health council, and the quality of its contact with the health authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and neighbour. The chairman of our health authority values his regular contacts with the Medway community health council. I am surprised that the Bill does not mention a continuing observer role for CHC Members on district health authorities. I hope that my hon. Friend will respond to that. I am not certain whether I agree with amendment No. 172, which would allow for a CHC nominee on the regional health authority. A proper relationship could be built up on the basis of an observer role.<br><br>
I return to the wise words of my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) about the representation of clinicians on the new bodies. In their role as purchasers of services, the new bodies will need to have clinical advice at a high level. It would be better for such advice to come from the authority rather than from an officer who has no power to influence a decision. That will be especially important when the new authorities are seeking contracts at all levels of primary, secondary and tertiary care, and when they examine sub-regional, regional and supra-regional specialties. They will then need a clinician of some gravitas—that expression has already been used— whose advice would be respected. Sadly, such weight and respect from within the profession has not always come to those who make up the bulk of directors of public health. The directors of public health will be the heirs, in duty though not in title, of the present district medical officers. They specialise in community care, which sadly does not always attract

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
the best-respected doctors. It may be necessary for my hon. Friend the Minister to respond, and prescribe that one of the non-executive members of the board or authority should be a clinician. I hope that he will give due thought to that, because it will be important to the authorities to have good clinical advice about where to place their contracts.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) tabled amendment Nos. 58 and 68, respectively proposing consultation before appointments to regional health authorities. The proposals for consultation in the amendments go somewhat over the top and could greatly delay appointments to RHAs as casual vacancies occur. Perhaps they wish to reconsider their amendments.<br><br>
I have already spoken at length about representation on local authorities so I shall not repeat myself. My words from earlier proceedings stand.<br><br>
I turn to the matter of representation of women on the new authorities. I hope that the hon. Member for Halifax will listen to what I have to say even though she was not prepared to allow my hon. Friends and I to intervene. When I was chairman of a health authority, two other chairmen were appointed to the region, and they were women. One has since been promoted to chairman of the region. She is one of the most distinguished Health Service chairmen —Mrs Julia Cumberlege. She was appointed not because she was a woman but because of her great experience in health matters and because of the excellence of her contribution.<br><br>
A fellow appointee of that time —the chairman for Maidstone, who has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone —also makes a first-class contribution. Both ladies contribute so excellently because of their skill and experience and not because of their gender. We must not appoint on the basis of gender.<br><br>
1 know that when my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) was a junior health Minister, she went to great trouble to find suitable women candidates for appointment as chairmen and many were appointed. She rejected a number of male appointees for chairmanship because she wanted to increase the number of women chairmen of health authorities. She had considerable difficulty finding ladies who were willing and able to give the necessary time and commitment to the important work involved. I hope that we can look forward to appointments on the basis of skill and experience rather than because people are women, black, business men or chairmen of Conservative associations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On 25 October 1989 at 10.5 pm the Foreign Secretary made an astonishing statement. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I look forward to the day when people like Keith Vaz are on our side of the House".</p></blockquote>
My career suitably damned, I thought that he was referring to my membership of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. But he went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Representation of black and Asian people at all levels of public life is of vital importance to the future of the nation."</p></blockquote>
The Foreign Secretary was attending a dinner at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
Royal Lancaster hotel for the Asian of the Year. I do not think that he attended in the hope of winning the award because, of course, no amount of camouflage would enable him to do so.<br><br>
Wednesday 25 October 1989 was an extraordinary day. In the morning, the Foreign Secretary was the Home Secretary and by about tea-time he had become Foreign Secretary. If someone had told him that by dinner-time he would be an Asian, he would probably have believed it. He was there to show the Government's support for the work of the black and Asian communities and to praise them for the way in which they had worked to develop links in society at local and national levels. He encouraged them after dinner to play a full part in the way in which the country was run.<br><br>
If we showed the Foreign Secretary the amendment, he would have no problem, remembering what he said, and what the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers have said in other contexts, in accepting the need for black and Asian people to be represented on district and regional health authorities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) said that because the boundaries of district health authorities were not coterminous with constituency boundaries, it was not possible to know precisely how many black or Asian people were in a given area. I should have thought that it was a reasonable and easy task to find that out.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman must accept that there is a large proportion of black and Asian people in our great conurbations. He must also accept that in our great cities —Birmingham, Manchester, London, Liverpool, and, indeed, Leicester—those communities exist and ought to be represented, not only on other bodies but on health authorities. It is incorrect of him to say that there are no statistics or facts and to rely upon aspects such as coterminous boundaries.<br><br>
It is clear from research by black and Asian organisations and by the Commission for Racial Equality that those two groups are not properly represented.<br><br>
Much of what my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) said in what was an excellent speech, despite the harassment that she received from Conservative Members, applies to black and Asian people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, especially as his gesture contrasts with the treatment that I received from the hon. Member for Halifax. The hon. Gentleman is, I presume, speaking to amendment No. 4(8), which states that there shall be
<br><blockquote><p>"on each district and regional health authority the same proportion of people from ethnic minority groups as there are in the area covered by the Authority".</p></blockquote>
Does he accept that that would limit the number? Surely the amendment implies that there must be the same proportion, not "at least" the same, so that if a number substantially in excess of the correct proportion were appointed to the authority, that would be wrong also, and ultra vires? Is not subsection (8) defective?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If the hon.Lady accepts her own
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0409">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
argument, she must accept the amendment. We are talking of figures that will show that local people are properly represented. I give Southall, in Ealing, as an example. Its Asian population comprises almost 60 per cent. of the population. In the Ealing health authority, there is only one Asian—a woman, who happens to be my sister. There is a need for proper representation there.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) tabled a written question on 11 December 1989, to which other speakers have referred. She asked the Minister for Health how many members of black and Asian ethnic minorities served on district and regional health authorities. The curt reply was that she did not believe that it was right that such statistics be kept. She said that they were not kept centrally and that she relied upon the nominations and views of the Commission for Racial Equality as to who should be nominated from black and Asian communities.<br><br>
It is useful to pause to examine what the Commission for Racial Equality said about those proposals. In a paper dated 30 August last, the commission stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposals for the reform of the National Health Service contained in the Government's White Paper do little to acknowledge the multiracial nature of British society. Recent research has shown that the needs of ethnic minority communities have been ignored in the past or provided for on a piecemeal basis."</p></blockquote>
As the Minister was so keen to take account of the commission's views when she gave her reply to my hon. Friend's question of 11 December, will she, when the debate us over—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The statutory man will reply. I hope that he will take note of the views of the Commission for Racial Equality and say whether he was prepared to accept the CRE as valid authority on 11 December. Will he also say whether he is prepared to do so exactly one month later?<br><br>
Wendy Moore, writing in the <i>Health Service Journal</i> in 1987, reflected the views of the trade union movement about the way in which regional health authorities were removing people from district health authorities. The article specifically mentioned that women and black and Asian people were being removed. The west midlands regional secretary spoke of those candidates as
<br><blockquote><p>"the victims of racial and sexual discrimination".</p></blockquote>
The Government are ignoring the guidelines issued by the former Department of Health and Social Security. The Bill will make nonsense of those guidelines if it becomes law; they state that one of the criteria is that there should be
<br><blockquote><p>"a 'suitable' representation of ethnic minority groups".</p></blockquote>
Research conducted by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham reveals that of the various authorities that cover areas with high densities of black and Asian people, none had suitable representation. The authority which covers Brixton and Lewisham—an area which has one of the largest Afro-Caribbean populations in the country—had no ethnic minority representative. That is a devastating indictment of the Government's guidelines.<br><br>
I shall be brief, as my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) wants to raise some important issues. I hope that Conservative Members will not indulge in tactics that will prevent him from doing so.<br><br>
I refer the Minister to a report published at Christmas by the hon. Member for Peckham and me. It can be obtained from the Labour party at 150 Walworth Road for 50p. If the Minister asks me nicely after the sitting, I may allow him to photocopy my copy. The report goes into the needs of the black and Asian communities in detail. They need to be represented, especially in relation to types of illness such as sickle-cell anaemia.<br><br>
It is not merely a matter of language. The Health Service must respond to the needs of the black and Asian communities, who have specific difficulties.<br><br>
I have not mentioned black and Asian women because my hon. Friends the Members for Peckham and Halifax spoke about them. For religious reasons, many Moslem women ask to be treated by a woman doctor and the Bill will limit their choice in selecting a GP.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not allowed to intervene in the speech of the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) so I shall make three brief points now. This is the 72nd anniversary of women getting the vote, so it is a good time to discuss women's representation.<br><br>
I support the aim that there should be more women in senior positions in public life. I have spent much of my working life trying to achieve a similar objective for representatives of the ethnic minorities and I shall continue to do so. It would be interesting to know whether the unions that sponsor Opposition Members have achieved the same percentage of women and ethnic minorities on their management committees as is being pressed upon us by the amendment.<br><br>
The longer the hon. Member for Halifax went on, the more it became apparent to me that although she was speaking in code, because of her party affiliation, she was singing a hymn to the Prime Minister. My right hon. Friend's sensitivity, interest in women's issues and capacity to make clear the pre-eminent position of the over 50 per cent. of the population from which she springs, are well known to Conservative Members but hitherto, as far as I can understand from the rhetoric, have been somewhat obscured from Opposition Members.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
In effect, the Member for Halifax is saying that if the Bill contains a requirement that particular groups should be represented in senior positions on all the bodies—in this case, the district health authority—it goes without saying that all the idealistic and optimistic qualities that one would wish for in those groups would somehow be encapsulated in whichever individuals were chosen. That is eminent nonsense, and I reject the amendment because it is eminent nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 4, which seeks to add the followiong words in new subsection (10):
<br><blockquote><p>"A person will not be eligible to hold office of chairman of a regional, district or special health authority if he or she has any financial interest in private health care."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0410">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
The amendment is the Labour party's attempt to block any abuse that might arise in the handling of contracts under the Bill, and we are determined to make sure that there is no abuse. We believe that there will be abuse, and there is evidence of abuse in the past, to which I shall come in a moment. However, we believe that a Bill that places a responsibility on regional health authorities to impress on district health authorities the need to contractorise or privatise contracts wherever possible, will inevitably lead to abuse. Such abuse should be curtailed.<br><br>
The monitoring by regional health authorities of the work done in this respect by district health authorities places considerable powers in the hands of general managers, managers and executive officers of the various authorities. Ultimately, health authorities and the National Health Service in general will be less a provider of services and more a purchaser and buyer of services. As my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) said, they will act as agencies purchasing and distributing services to the public. We object to that, and therefore we are trying to build safeguards into the Bill.<br><br>
We all know where the contracts will be They have already started in catering, domestic services, laundry, computer services and property management. The Bill contains many proposals, in effect, for privatisation of property management at various tiers within the Service. There is talk of privatisation of ambulance services. Important new business will result from the Bill, in the purchasing of care packages for the elderly, the mentally ill and other groups. There are also arrangements for the purchase of elective surgery in neighbouring districts from trust hospital organisations and the private sector generally. All the new requirements on health authorities to put work out to the private sector mean that money will circulate between health authorities and the private sector, and in the transfer of money there is room for abuse.<br><br>
I can point to abuse that, in my view, has taken place in the past. I draw the Committee's attention to a letter, on headed paper, from the headquarters offices of the Leeds Western health authority.<br><br>
The letter is from the chairman, Mr. John D. Jackson, and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"As Chairman of Centaur I have pleasure in enclosing a Centaur Privilege Discount Card' which is a convenient way for you to obtain a Centaur branded garment at a special price. It does not apply to reduced or 'Sale' merchandise.zz</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Details of the discount and where it may be obtained are set out below.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I am offering this facility to Authority Members, Senior Managers and Consultant Medical Staff in Leeds Western Health Authority and trust you will find this helpful if you intend buying Centaur merchandise."</p></blockquote>
Of course, the chap who ran the authority owned the business. He pushed his business and used his position as chairman of the authority. My hon. Friends and I object most strongly to that. That is why the Government should accept our amendment.<br><br>
Perhaps I may highlight another area of concern with which the amendment would deal. I refer my hon. Friends and Ministers to a report which, I understand, appeared in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 25 February 1988. I have been supplied with the following information about it:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Union officials are calling for the resignation of Northallerton health area authority chairman. Mr. Benet Ormerod, who is opening a private hospital to care for the elderly. The Unions claim the conflict of interest is so great that he should quit his post immediately. Mr. Ormerod is behind the Benet partnership—a company which is investing £1 million to convert an 18th century listed country house."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Raymond Gray, the NUPE area official, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"He should resign immediately. How can he possibly justify holding such an important position in the NHS, which is cutting State beds, with being in charge of a private hospital which will benefit from any reductions in State provision?</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>As chairman of the Health Authority which is having to make cuts,"—</p></blockquote>
I understand that it is £400,000-worth of cuts in beds—
<br><blockquote><p>"he is in a position to gain information which would be of benefit to the private sector."</p></blockquote>
Finally, having ignored several letters, Mr. Ormerod was obliged to reply. This is the cynical reply from the chairman of a health authority:
<br><blockquote><p>"Your outburst in the press has a more positive element in a way perhaps not visible to anyone else but me, for it has given my work and the home a great deal of free publicity. Had I known of your interest in my work I might have been persuaded to reserve precious resources for advertising space. Perhaps the fault is mine and I should have offered you a post at the beginning of the venture."</p></blockquote>
That is the quality of person whom Ministers believe they can appoint to chair area health authorities. Labour objects. We believe that such people should be removed from office. I understand that that man has left his post. I do not know why he left. I understand that he resigned.<br><br>
In another letter I understand that he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I will exercise my role as health authority Chairman as I have always done in a positive and contributory way and I will resign if and when my conscience demands it and I leave my future as Chairman in the capable hands of the Secretary of State within whose gift all Chairmen's futures lie."</p></blockquote>
That is untenable and something must be done. The problem is that no criminal sanctions are available if a district or regional health authority chairman, or member, fails to disclose a pecuniary interest and benefits financially from the post he holds. The powers available for district health authorities are not equivalent to those in local government where, at least, there are criminal sanctions. But even in local government the majority of local authorities oppose the present arrangements.<br><br>
There are other ways to deal with the matter. Our amendment proposes a course, but others might include a national register of interests applying to the chairmen of regional or district health authorities. Perhaps the ministerial rules, on which I commented the other day, could apply. Ministers are required to arrange their private affairs so that they do not conflict with their public duties. That has had an effect; Ministers must take action to remove such conflict or any conflict that might appear to arise. That rule should apply equally to the chairmen of health authorities.<br><br>
When the Minister winds up, he should give assurances —not those set out on page 23 in the White Paper, which are quite insufficient. I do not have time to discuss them now. We want real assurances that such appointments will not be made when there is a potential for conflicting interests. If they are made and conflict arises, those people should immediately be removed from office. We need assurances. Labour demands assurances. Millions of people who are worried about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0411">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
privatisation and commercialism of the National Health Service generally are also worried about such issues and demand action from the Government on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is a common theme in my hon. Friends' speeches, it is that the National Health Service belongs to the people. Today, we tried to ensure that people have a say in the future strategy for the services that the NHS seeks to provide.<br><br>
I shall refer specifically to amendments Nos. 133 and 134. The rights and needs of those with disabilities, their carers and their advocates are profoundly important and should be recognised in the primary legislation. People with disabilities support our proposals. Certainly, the views of the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation give substantial support to the argument that such associations should have at least one person appointed to an authority. That is not a great or overwhelming demand. Perhaps it is not even representative of the 6.25 million people with disabilities in Britain today who are surely entitled to their say in how services are provided—or not provided, as the case may be.<br><br>
People with disabilities should be part of our various communities. They are entitled to express their views, and not just on access, although that is important because far too many of our large institutions, including our large hospitals, simply do not bear access in mind.<br><br>
It would be patronising to people with disabilities to restrict their remit and interest in access. They want to express their views on the quality of service. They want to ensure that the experiences and quality of life of those with disabilities—people with physical disabilities, such as the problems of spastics, or those who have learning difficulties—are reflected in the running of the National Health Service.<br><br>
Time prevents me from citing it in full, but in 1981 the Department issued a circular which said that suitable representation of the mental health and handicapped sectors and, in appropriate cases, of ethnic minorities should be considered when appointments are made. We are seeking to realise that aspiration and make it legitimate. All the more so because since 1981 the rights of people with disabilities do not seem to have met with particular success. Therefore, the 6.25 million people with disabilities in Britain are finding that the services are very patchy. In many instances, patients with disabilities are dependent upon an accident of geography for service provision. That is unacceptable.<br><br>
12.45pm<br><br>
We know that the Bill is not only about the National Health Service, important though that is. As my hon. Friends said, we are talking about a programme of care. That includes community care, the need for bridging arrangements for people leaving long-stay psychiatric hospitals to go into community care, and so on. My limited experience tells me that people with disabilities do not want to be done unto; they have rights which they wish to assert and opinions which they want to be taken into account. Those are not confined to the services, needs and rights of people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
with disabilities, they extend to the National Health Service and to community care globally.<br><br>
I am watching the clock, Dame Janet, and I shall conclude by commending the amendments to the Committee. They are reasonable and supported by relevant voluntary organisations. The amendments are consistent, dare I say it, with the main thrust of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 which, in terms of consumer rights as hon. Members have mentioned, refers in the short title to representation, consultation and to services. As that Act was passed by both Houses of Parliament without one vote, we believe that its principles should be enshrined in this Bill. The rights of disabled people, alas not yet recognised in full by legisalation in terms of the National Health Service, will be enhanced if the amendments are supported.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the hour, I shall confine my remarks to 10 minutes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman), in opening the debate, made three statements with which all Conservative Members will profoundly disagree. First, the hon. Lady implied—[<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Lady would listen to me —</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not listen to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I should make it clear again that I deplore seated interjections. They do not make for clarity and on occasion they can be distinctly discourteous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Peckham commenced by arguing that this was the first step on the road to privatising the Health Service. That allegation was repeated by Members of the Labour party. However, it does not become closer to the truth by repetition. It is untrue, and the hon. Lady knows that.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Lady said that our proposals, especially in clause 1, showed that the Government's intention was to limit choice rather than to expand it. The purpose of our proposals is to ensure that resources are provided to those patients who of their own volition, and upon good medical advice, wish to take elective surgery outside their own districts. Therefore, choice in secondary and primary care, and the ability to change doctors more easily, is available. Thirdly, the hon. Lady said that the proposals were not seated in a desire to represent and serve the local community. That is nonsense. We are separating the roles of district health authorities from the hospitals providing services and ensuring that the authorities, in planning the care of people within a catchment area, will serve their local communities far better than at present.<br><br>
Before I reply to the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), and other points raised by Opposition Members, I want briefly to place on record the seven general principles that have governed our approach to the appointment to and membership of health authorities.<br><br>
First, we want smaller-sized authorities, 11 in size —I shall deal with that point later—because they willbe morebusinesslike,although theyare not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0412">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
businesses. I do not use the language of business or commerce in relation to the Health Service, but our proposals will make them more efficient and businesslike. Secondly, we shall end the confusion of their roles. They are not a collection of representatives; they are there to manage the Health Service in the interests of their local communities.<br><br>
Thirdly,—the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) raised the question of Mr. Jack Berry at an earlier sitting—we want people of individual skills and experience, like Mr. Jack Berry, to be appointed but on their own merits and for their skills and contributions. Fourthly, we do not intend— the hon. Member for Peckham talked about business men being bussed in in a very derogatory terms—that these authorities will consist of groups of former bank managers or business men bussed in. They will represent a broad collection of skills and experience. Fifthly, we do not believe in quotas. I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Maidstone (Miss Widdecome) and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). Both are right to resist the notion of quotas.<br><br>
Before I deal briefly with the issues raised concerning women, I should apologise to the Committee. Earlier, I inadvertently misled the Committee by referring to districts not regions when I cited that 35 per cent. of the membership were women. The Secretary of State appoints members to regional health authorities, not to districts. We do not collect centrally information from all of the 190 English health districts. I can confirm however, that at regional level 35 per cent. of all the members are women. What I said was an aspiration—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On that point, will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be replying to the hon. Gentlement's contribution, but my minutes are running out. I sense that the Committee would like to conclude its consideration of this bacth of admendments, and I know that the Member for Peckham would like to respond.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) cited the Women's National Commission, which is an advisory committee to the Government, and the report, "Women and the Health Service". The hon. Lady fairly and accurately stated the report's recommendation that appointees—the Secretary of State and regional health authorities—should ensure that such bodies, health authorities for example, should reflect the composition of the local population and include a realistic representation of women. Hence, which is what is presumably behind the hon. Lady's logic, her statement that 50 per cent. of the population were women but 40 per cent. was the subject of the amendment. I do not disagree with that figure as a target. When we return to this subject under clause 2, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minster for Health will speak on the issue.<br><br>
The Committee may be interested to know that 46 per cent. of medical students today are women. Forty-five per cent of all trainee GPs are women, and 50 per cent. of doctors may be women before the end of the century.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz)
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
referred to ethnic minorities. I had a meeting with the Commission for Racial Equality and meetings with representatives of ethnic minorities and the Health Service. I shall repeat what I said to them for the record. I said that we would like to see more nominations from the ethnic minorities, in particular from the professional bodies concerned with the Health Service, for appointment. My hon. Friend the Minster for Health and I are responsible for a number of appointments within the Health Service and go to much trouble to appoint as many women, and representatives of the ethnic minorities, as we possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minster give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I must bring my remarks to a close.<br><br>
The sixth and seventh general principles are that for the first time we want executives to serve on authorities, which has never been the case before. Finally, we want the community health councils—here I turn to my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Counchman) —</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about Mrs. Thornton-Berry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that.<br><br>
We want community health councils to be independent bodies. Therefore they cannot be represented on health authorities. They must be independent because their job is to represent patients and criticise constructively the actions of authorities where necessary. They have never had membership of local authorities—[Interruption].</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee about seated interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend for Gillingham asked me for an assurance, which I will give him. We do not propose to change the basis of CHCs, their duties and relationship to health authorities because they must be independent. They will continue to have observers at health authority meetings and I pay tribute to their work. As a Minister, I probably see more representatives from CHCs than do other Minsters, and I appreciate their dedicated and valuable work.<br><br>
On the subject of Wales, I shall draw the remarks of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) to the attention of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. I understand that the Welsh Office published a proposal last November to improve community health council work in Wales and to align the number of CHCs with that of district health authorities. That seems sensible. There is nothing in the Bill to that effect but I am sure that my hon. Friend will consider what has been said.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington talked about pecuniary interests. He is right when he says that the Government have introduced compulsory competitive tendering for laundry, cleaning and catering. The Labour party proposed to withdrawn the compulsion in that competitive tendering, although that process has saved the Health Service well over £100 million, and all for the benefits of patients.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington asked a specific
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0413">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
pecuniary interests. He is right when he says that the Government have introduced compulsory competitive tendering for laundry, cleaning and catering. The Labour party proposed to withdrawn the compulsion in that competitive tendering, although that process has saved the Health Service well over £100 million, and all for the benefits of patients.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington asked a specific question about the declaration of interests. I draw his attention to the statutory position, which is clear; under regulations made in 1983, a chairman or member of a health authority is required to declare any pecuniary interest direct or indirect in a contract or any other matter which is the subject of consideration by the health authority. He or she may not then take part in any consideration or discussion of the contract, or any other matter, or vote in any question in respect of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that very point —</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr hon. Friend for Chislehurst asked me at least six questions, and in the remaining minute I shall try to answer as many of them as I can. He asked about size and how members would be appointed. After Royal Assent, we shall lay regulations before Parliament detailing the appointment procedure. The House will have a chance to consider the matter. I draw my hon. Friend's attention to page 87 of the notes on clauses, where the Government's thinking is spelt out very clearly. On teaching, we shall make sure that at least one non-executive member is drawn from medical school, in order to cement the relationship.<br><br>
I conclude on my hon. Friends point about medical representation. In relation to non-executives, I and my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State share his view that we want medical representation — but not, of course, from the consultants and doctors working in that authority. In relation to executives, we expect that the director of public health will be a member — we are not prescriptive about that, but it would be clearly sensible — and also, perhaps, a representative of the nursing profession.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
I invite my hon. Friends to resist the amendment, because we have a sensible, sane, comprehensive and rational approach to the appointment and membership of the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the Minster's disappointing response that the voice of the patient who will use the services is to be silent. The interests of local people will be overridden by business men who will be brought into district health authorities to run them as a business, and no doubt some of those business men will use their positions on DHAs to make rich pickings from the profits of privatisation and commercialisation.<br><br>
We shall press the amendment to a Division, and if any Conservative Members vote against it, let them not talk about the consumer or the patient hereafter in Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee dividend:</i> Ayes 13, Noes 17.</p>
