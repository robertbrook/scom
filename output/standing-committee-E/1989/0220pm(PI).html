</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make my speech short, but not that short. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is not here, as we witnessed an historic occasion this morning when he had perhaps one of the few lucid moments that he has ever had. He was talking, or at least close to talking, common sense. Conservative Members are worried that money may not go to the services that are required. We are not alone in our concern about that. The Healthcare Financial Management Association— hardly a hotbed of Left-wing political thought— recently stated:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0962">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the one hand the Government do not wish to "earmark" or "ring-fence" the resources provided, leaving Local Authorities with the flexibility to determine priorities within their total resources. The mechanism for ensuring equity of use depending upon the joint planning process with health authorities and other agencies. On the other hand there is a concern that the Rate Support Grant formula was designed in advance of the current proposals and was thus not designed to distribute the care element of the social security payments which will in future be included. Thus, when the money reaches Local Authorities it will be competed for not only by social services budgets, but by education and other services."</p></blockquote>
That is true, and it is worrying. I support most of the Bill, and am happy to support my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State. However, this part of the Bill has the fingermarks of the Treasury all over it. It is as simple and as straightforward as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) was also absolutely right. We must ensure that the £900 million or so that is transferred to local authorities is spent in the way that it is meant to be spent. My right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State was right to say that the real difficulty in local government is assessing priorities—should money be spent on community care, day centres, services for the elderly and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I suspect that I am not alone in finding it difficult to hear his speech. I should like him to speak up a little. I remind Committee Members that the room has no amplification. The microphones are solely for the benefit of 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I was bellowing, but I shall speak more loudly. The Bill has been drafted so that local authorities cannot show where they may be underfunded. That is where Treasury controls will be applied. Earlier, as I said, my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State spoke about priorities and local authorities' difficulties in deciding where to put the money. However, we must ensure that that money gets to them in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who will reply to the debate, talked of more money going into the services and of including a new weighting, or incremental element. Many of us want to hear more about that as we are very worried that, although social services will receive a certain amount to deal with elderly people, that will have to cover many problems. Elderly people are not just old. They can need special nursing care for incontinence, or special facilities for mental handicap. At present, those not included. The existing mechanism is inadequate, and I want my hon. Friend to comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame the Treasury for exerting pressure to control the funds because we know how much money local authorities waste. One has only to consider my borough—the Labour-controlled Harlow authority—to realise the monumental waste and mismanagement that exists. The Audit Commission agrees with that. The Healthcare Financial Management Association proposes a compromise, which may be helpful to my hon. Friend. It says:
	<span class='label label-info column'>1124</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given the Government's view that "earmarking" or "ring-fencing" would be inappropriate and given the concerns of the service purchases and providers the best solution would appear to be for a review to be carried out after, say, three years of operation. This review could properly be carried out by the Audit Commission to examine the scope and provision of available resources for Community Care."</p></blockquote>
That is the best alternative to ring-fencing. The Committee must be sure that the money handed to local authorities by the Treasury will be spent on those areas on which it is meant to be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of this debate is about whether we trust local authorities. Many of us do not. Moreover, many local authority associations do not trust local authorities. That is why we must have checks and safeguards. The proposal of the Healthcare Financial Management Association may be sensible departure, and I ask my hon. Friend to consider that carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendments Nos. 252 and 253 and refer to amendments Nos. 807 to 810, with which I am particularly involved. The existing distribution of funding to local authorities is profoundly unfair. The transfer of the social care element of income support to local authorities has not been explored so far. No hon. Member would oppose what is happening, on the basis of a proper assessment. However, it is important to make the point that public money is being distributed in a rather odd way throughout the country. Certain parts, such as the south-east, might be termed the Costa Geriatrica. Huge amounts of public money are invested there, at the expense of other areas. I am worried about how that money is concentrated in those areas and will be effectively ring-fenced when the Bill's provisions are implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The director of social services in my authority of Wakefield—David Lane—compared the amounts paid in the south-coast belt of Devon, Dorset, Hampshire and east and west Sussex, which has a population of 4.5 million and 26,000 beds in the private sector, with those of west and south Yorkshire, which has a population of 3.25 million and fewer than 4,000 beds. He made the reasonable assumption that 50 per cent of private beds are paid for through income support, at an average cost of £8,000 a year. He calculated that the average authority in the south coast belt would have an annual income of £11.5 million, while an authority in west and south Yorkshire would have an annual income of £2.2 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What could we in Wakefield do with £2.2 million additional revenue funding to care for the elderly instead of putting them into institutions? We should not forget that public funding tends to be redistributed through income support from the poorer areas to those with substantial resources. The Bill will continue that redistribution. While I accept that future placements will be decided by assessment, we all know that for many years we shall be paying for people who have never been assessed. A huge amount of public money will go in their direction for some time to come. That troubles me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who is not in the Room at present,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1125</span>
said, this morning that the existing standard spending assessment meant that expenditure by those authorities that I have already mentioned—Kent, east and west Sussex, Hampshire and Dorset—was assessed at a level that is 49 per cent higher than the actual figure. There is clearly something wrong, as those authorities do not have the same priorities as the authorities in west Yorkshire. The operation of the system at present and in the future has aroused anxiety, especially in connection with the provisions for social services departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Bill through the eyes of a former practitioner. I tend to ask what it will mean for social workers in an area team, and what its implications will be for resources and casework. I am worried by the way in which general funding for social services has operated, especially since the Seebohm reorganisation in 1970. That reorganisation caused the less fashionable groups that get little media attention to lose out. Media pressure has forced resources to be directed towards children at risk. I do not argue against that, but one cannot have it both ways. Problems in another client group that has lost resources should be the responsibility of those who manage the resources and not of the people who handle cases at the grass roots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44 provides that the Secretary of State can conduct inquiries into the way that cases are handled. One of my cases in the early 1970s was the subject of such an inquiry. An elderly lady lived with her daughter and died in unfortunate circumstances. I recall the experience of being cross-questioned at the inquest. One of the assistant directors of the authority for which I worked had made it very clear that I should not give details of the problems that I encountered in managing a huge caseload with limited resources and support. That inquest was called because we were under such pressure to attend to incidents of child abuse that we had no time to supervise any other cases. Unless funding is earmarked or ring-fenced it will be used on other problems because of the demands faced by social workers at area team level. How can a case be allocated to a social worker when the social worker does not exist? The Secretary of State should tackle that problem. All over the country, many statutory child care cases and others cannot be allocated to social workers because there are no such workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Harriet Harman (Peckham)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in my constituency, when the Department of Health issued a document entitled "Working Together", it fell on an empty desk in the social services department because there was no social worker and on another empty desk in the health authority because the posts of health visitors had been frozen? Two people who were supposed to be working together on child abuse were not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The picture painted by my hon. Friend is especially acute in London, but it also applies elsewhere. Last Friday, I was at a meeting in my constituency with a head teacher who complained that she was deeply worried that there were insufficient social workers to supervise cases of children about whose welfare there was grave concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1126</span>
Wakefield district council tries desperately hard to recruit social workers but cannot keep them because of demands elsewhere. The work is so stressful that often people simply leave. Because of criticism in Humberside, offers of £2,000 are being made to nearly qualified social workers to attract them. Such measures simply transfer the problem from one borough to another—Humberside will attract social workers at another borough's expense. I hope that the Government will take seriously the major problems that exist at the grass roots. They relate directly to earmarked funding. Ring-fencing funds is the only way to protect people dependent on community care, especially children at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame anyone for saying that children at risk should have priority. Cases such as that of Beverley Lewis occur because of the lack of resources. It is time to stop blaming social workers and to start blaming politicians who are in charge of the resources and responsible for people's circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other series of amendments deals with funding on mental health and relates to proposed section 7D, which allows the Secretary of State to give grants to local authorities towards specific expenditure for the mentally ill. We welcome the long-overdue recognition of problems faced by the mentally ill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, proposed section 7D is an admission of failure by the Government adequately to provide alternative care and resources to people who have beeen turfed out of psychiatric hospitals over the past ten years. Thousands of psychiatric patients face tragic circumstances because the Department of Health has been more concerned with monetary issues than with issues of social policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Under-Secretary of State is worried about the problems, which are not his fault, and he is genuinely trying to get to grips with them. But the Government have been lax. They have put pressure on district health authorities to run down psychiatric institutions because their capital assets can ease the pressure on the Exchequer. They paid bonuses to district and unit general managers to get rid of patients without ensuring that they were appropriately accommodated when they were discharged from care. In a sense, proposed section 7D is Government conscience money, because the Government are aware of the problems that they have caused. I have heard Conservative Back Benchers make comments about them. Numerous homeless and rootless people are rotting on the streets because the pyschiatric hospitals have closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall never forget seeing, as a member of the Wakefield health authority, a document published by the Yorkshire regional health authority that effectively said that long-stay patients at Stanley Royd hospital were not dying quickly enough. The document admitted that resources were running down too rapidly simply because the projected death rate did not materialise. The hospital was looking after them too well. That is frightening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Alice Mahon	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend made that point, because it shows that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0964">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1127</span>
terminology used by management has deteriorated over the past few years. I remember a report that referred to the elderly mentally ill as "bed blockers". That is an inhumane term, although not as extreme as my hon. Friend's example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's illustration shows that business language is now used in the caring services. We no longer use caring terminology; the trend is more and more towards business phrases about market economics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak to amendments Nos. 807 to 810 and outline the Opposition's aims in tabling them. Amendment No. 807 requires payments to be made on the basis of expenditure jointly agreed by district health authorities and local authorities. The direction of the Secretary of State should be agreed with the local authority associations that are directly concerned with the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 807 is a probing amendment to elicit information from the Government about their plans for funding the mental health specific fund. Although the Opposition support that fund, we are worried about the way that it is currently handled and about the lack of information on how it will operate in future. So far, the Government have made no announcements about the funding. We understand that the Government intend to fund directly through regional health authorities for purposes that the regions see fit to fund. That means that RHAs will determine the rate of change of community care plans as they go along. So, in effect, there will be two sets of plans—one for those who are mentally ill and the elderly and the other for those with learning difficulties or physical disabilities. That will give rise to difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 807 seeks to ensure a more equal partnership between health authorities and local authorities. We want a better local joint understanding of plans and policies and position statements of local authorities. The amendment also seeks a social work and local government community care perspective, including hours and employment preparation, leisure, diversionary activities and local public transport arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint involvement of district health authorities and local authorities will ensure more natural and equal partnerships in agreements on mental health expenditure. It may also bring about an acknowledgement from the Government that the psychiatric service should be only one part of the care team that makes plans—the other is local government. Agreement should be reached at national level by the local authorities and the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 809 requires that grants will not be deducted from a separate rate support grant compilation. Local authorites which have had bad experiences with this Government are worried that they will be given the money as a specific grant but that it will be taken away again because their general grant from rate funding will be reduced. We want an assurance that this will be new money and that it will
	<span class='label label-info column'>1128</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendment No. 278, to mention briefly amendment No. 504 and to comment on ring-fencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before that I have great sympathy with the idea that any new policy should be protected against competition by ring-fencing, but everyone would like that for every new policy. Ring-fencing carries with it serious difficulties that I should resist. When a fashion in caring changes, elaborate arrangements have to be made to transfer money from those who had a ring-fence responsibility for that form of care, to those who have now accepted it. That underlines the danger of such arrangements. Community care will develop by forming new partnerships and teams. Many of the professions allied to medicine will be as dependent on the education authority and the social services, as they have been on the health authority. That gnaws at the edge of the ring-fencing principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure that housing is not only modified for community care needs, but built to take account of them. Community care should be a joint enterprise that transcends local authority boundaries. Ring-fencing would do more harm than good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee might be surprised that I speak to amendment No. 278, which seeks to extend the categories which are ring-fenced within the Opposition's proposals. The mentally ill have been ring-fenced because of irresistible political pressure to protect that most vulnerable of all groups in the short-term while community care policy is developed. The Royal College of Nursing and others believe that that is admirable, but recognise that there is a serious danger of other vulnerable groups losing out. If the Committee accepted the principle of ring-fencing, amendment No. 278 would be worth voting upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additonal costs of community care that arise because people live far from centres of population have been taken into account in the Bill. Otherwise there would be a peverse incentive to send people from the north Downs in my constituency—which is remote from Maidstone or Chatham—into residential care, against their will, because the provision of domiciliary care would be too expensive. Will my hon. Friend the Minister assure us that those considerations, which should apply a fortiori to places such as the constituency of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), are taken into account when forecast levels of support are made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I sympathise with the points made by the Minister and the Secretary of State, I favour the principle of ring-fencing. Most hon. Members accept that we must be clear about why and how we should apply the principle and whether it requires a time limit. On previous occasions I have argued with local authorites in my area and elsewhere that earmarked funding should be assigned. The local authorities have been hostile to that. I have not always agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and individual local authorities on different areas of public spending. I have been in favour of ring-fencing or earmarked funding for different categories of provision, depending on the nature of the need that must be met. However, this case is distinctive because local authorities are calling for it, which is a significant departure from normal practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and the Minister are parading the ironic argument that they are loth to direct local authorities and are not anxious to take power to the centre and influence local decision-making by procedures that are made in this place or determined in Whitehall Departments. Coming from a Government who have done so much to circumscribe the powers of local authorities and abolish certain categories of English local authorities, that is pretty rich. By resisting ring-fencing, it is ironic for the Government to parade themselves as the great protectors of local democracy. A wry smile, to say the least, comes across the faces of some of us when we hear Ministers go on in that way.

There were some interesting exchanges on the poll tax during Prime Minister's Question Time this afternoon. We do not always enjoy looking at the faces of hundreds of Conservative Back Benchers, but it was a joy this afternoon to look at the numbers who seemed forlorn and reluctant to spring to the defence of the Prime Minister when she tried to justify the poll tax— and no wonder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As with the poll tax, if there is no ring-fencing the implications for local authorities attempting to meet policy requirements and local needs will be considerable. The problems that are building up in England have existed in Scotland for a while, and Conservative Members would do well to examine the impact of the poll tax on their party's fortunes north of the border since the general election. Local authorities will have to meet the extra demands that the policy will impose, but, without ring-fencing, there will be two implications. First, as we have heard, committees will be under pressure to cut social services provision to meet requirements elsewhere. Secondly, the effect on poll tax levels in many parts of the country will be horrendous if authorities attempt to spend up to the limit to make the policy a success. I shall say more about that when we discuss the Scottish context, but I shall take the example of the area covered by the Highland regional council. The council is presently discussing with the Scottish Office the substantial bills incurred by the recent bad weather. I appreciate that local authorities in the south of England face the same problems and that there is not much choice about such provision. The work must be done, either to remedy damage or to prevent it happening in the future, but it has an impact on overall spending. It gives a competitive edge to the spending limits in other departments, not least to the social work budget and the general provision for care in the community. The presence of the poll tax and the absence of ring-fencing will pose huge problems for the successful implementation of the policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should introduce ring-fencing for two reasons. First, the local authorities' call for it has been fairly unaminous. For once, they have asked for a central Government diktat that will influence their futre spending decisions. Secondly, as the Minister noted earlier, the issue is not partisan. All parties support care in the community and the associated follow-through. The introduction of ring-fencing will make a reality of the Governments's rhetoric and the policy that they want to see implemented. I hope that the Department of Health will see the value of that principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingstone (Mr. Cook) will not tempt me to support amendment No. 252, for the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) advanced so eloquently. The associated loss of flexibility is a high price to pay. The amendment sets the pattern of care in concrete and cannot take account of future developments. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0966">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1131</span>
Under-Secretary and I share the Daventry district council area, and last weekend we studied the new draft local plans. I was pleased that those plans recognised the need to provide some access housing in the rural areas. Access housing is not the same as full sheltered or disabled housing, but it enables people to accommodate disabled relatives. That is an example of sensible forward planning outwith the narrow provisions of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that the Opposition is right to remind the Government that the community care project must be adequately funded. My readiness to reject the principle of ring-fencing is predicated on the assumption that spending will be sufficient. I am prepared to put that caveat on the record. We shall return to it later and I shall be interested in what the Minister has to say about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the fullness of time, I shall ascertain the figures and tell the hon. Gentleman whether they are adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted a chink in the logic of the position on earmarking by providing separate grants earmarked for mental illness. I do not object to that. Conservative Members do not need to be ideological or theological about it. If future experience develops satisfactorily it may be possible to restore flexibility to local authorities by doing away with this specific practice, and by returning to the general grant structure. I am worried about difficult areas as they bear across local authority experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One issue was well ventilated in the debate over amendment No. 504, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) and spoken to by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not know that our hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting that on the record. However, I am sure that the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely reasonable to expect the Government to recognise the specific problems of specific areas — either scattered rural areas such as those in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye or remote parts of my own, and areas of social or other stress. I am not especially worried whether that is done within the overall block funding, or by means of specific provison. However, the issue must be considered seriously and funding must be built into the structure of the grants made by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1132</span>
Government to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's points about the geography of special areas. However, I cannot understand how Conservative Members can say that we need earmarking or some sort of allocation measure to take account of geographical needs, while we cannot have ring-fencing to take account of the overall policy. If the logic of the principle is conceded in the one case, how can it be denied in the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am allowed to make my speech, I shall say why I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I am anxious to maintain the general principle of local authority autonomy except in relation to mental illness, but we should consider specific areas of difficulty and invite the Government to ascertain the best way to eliminate them. On the issue of geographic, regional or local difficulty there is consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about derogations from the typical pattern of care as they affect a specific district. High levels of expenditure may affect a specific district. I shall provide an example. The Minister will know of Grafton Regis in my constituency. The town has a specialist centre mat is run by the private sector, but which is widely used by NHS patients for the treatment of head injuries—a real problem in our society. Such industries often involve multiple disability, including both mental and physical factors. Treatment involves enormous expense, but has met considerable success. Doctors work closely with the Headway organisation, to which the Minister is giving some financial support, even though it is a relatively unfashionable area of disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in the treatment of physically handicapped or disabled young people, expenses are high, not least because their life expectations are higher than those who retire into a care home. They will be expensive patients. Statistically and numerically they may be smaller in number but greater in need than the average run of local authority clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take up a point made by the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), if the overall funding package is properly worked out, most matters should even out over the many clients for whom the local authority is responsible. It will be up to the local authority to tackle its problems and to allocate its funding. For example, few people suffer from head injuries or genetic complaints such as Huntingdon's chorea or other such physical disabilities, but those who do have greater needs. The ability of the local authority to contemplate funding is then more in question, especially if a centre is required to cover the needs of more than one local authority. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will say that local authorities can buy care from one another, but problems could arise if one local authority had to shoulder a large part of the burden. How will that be dealt with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter of concern is the good practice of caring organisations. Some provision should be made for grants for innovation, traning and research on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0967">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1133</span>
same lines as the SIFT system, which we discusseed in relation to teaching hospitals, so that carers can get some money from the centre. However, I support the block funding system that is proposed as part of a general settlement rather than earmarked funding for each and every packet. The Bill appears to provide powers for making specific grants only for mental illness. I have identified other particular difficulties and I hope that my hon. Friend will consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw on the analogy of educational support grants where most of the money is found by local authorities—albeit that they receive a block grant from the Government—but central funds are available for particular educational needs. That is a sensible compromise and I hope that my hon. Friend will consider it favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take issue with the approach adopted by the hon. Members for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe). In effect, they have asked the Government to come up with adequate resources to do the job, yet they oppose our proposal to guarantee resources, without coming up with a real alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Kent spoke about partnership. I have worked in local government for many years and I am a strong believer in partnership. Bur partnership cannot work without the resources that are necessary to do the job. That is the reason for this debate today. The arguments put by Conservative Members for ring-fencing miss the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 746 deals with resources for housing
	<br><blockquote><p>"for persons suffering from mental illness".</p></blockquote>
All too frequently, former mental health patients end up living out of cardboard boxes in London. Unless the amendment is accepted, that may continue. Recently, local authorities have shifted resources in their housing budgets towards meeting the dire needs of the elderly, but that has coincided with the Government's cut in the budget for local authority housing without compensating for it in housing association budgets. That means that the provision for the elderly has been at the expense of ordinary families and others on lengthening housing waiting lists and the homeless in our towns and cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government wish provision to be made for the mentally ill at the expense of families? Will they continue to abandon the homeless? do the Government expect local authorities to do for the housing budget what the magic porridge pot did for feeding children in nursery stories, as their response to the debate implies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central relationship of housing to care in the community has been illustrated by two recent reports. One in a survey of discharged psychiatric patients in Westminster. It shows that one in four psychiatric patients sent from hospital to be cared for in the community is homeless, and that 28 per cent of patients lack the basic requirement of an independent life—that is, a home. Earlier, I mentioned a senior medical officer in a hospital in south Wales who said that he was ashamed to see some of his ex-patients on the streets with the down-and-outs in central Cardiff,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1134</span>
because of the lack of support and proper housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, some homeless people have been placed in elderly people's blocks of flats. That has led to horrific problems for the elderly people and it has undermined the position of ex-patients. Both groups have suffered because proper support and housing have not been provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Half the people in London who seek a bed for the night have a mental illness problem. That is a fivefold increase since 1983. The Westminster survey found that half the homeless patients are in bed-and-breakfast hotels or hostels and the remainder have no fixed abode. That is no way to care for the mentally ill. They have not been moved from institutional care to care in the community, they have been abandoned. Unless the amendment is accepted, the Bill will encourage that abandonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People suffering problems now will be joined by about 60,000 others who are currently in mental illness hospitals and will also require housing in the community. Local authorities have taken measures to tackle the crisis, but increased homelessness has been created by Government cuts in investment in housebuilding by local authorities and housing associations, combined with the sale of council houses. The result has been the growing use of unsuitable temporary accommodation for homeless people and, worst of all, the use of bed-and-breakfast hotels. The Department of Health should recognise the problem and also have discussions with the Department of the Environment about the national housing programme. The amendment will enable housing to be taken properly into account as part of care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office should find it easier to solve this problem because the Under-Secretary of State simply has to talk to himself; he does not have to call a ministerial meeting. He can tackle the problem when he lies in his bath or sits in his office in the Welsh Office. There is no sign that he will try to solve the problem. In a reply to me he said that it was essential that housing authorities play a major role in the production of social care plans as part of the care in community strategy to assist the programme. But, when he explained how housing associations would play their part, and gave figures which hardly compensated for the lack of general finance for housing in Wales, he described how he would help local authorities in Wales without referring to the housing to be provided by those authorities. Therefore, despite talking to himself about the problem, he has not taken account of the need to guarantee housing provision in the community care plans for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seven millon or eight million people in Britain have suffered mental health problems or will require professional intervention in future. That is one in ten of the population. Many of those will return to their own homes, but the predicament of others will be more precarious. The Bill should be amended for their benefit, so that the provision of housing for those who are to be cared for in the community is included from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for

	<span class='label label-info column'>1135</span>
Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) refers to geography. Demography and geography should be taken into account when examining needs throughout Britain. The Secretary of State for Wales realises that Wales has specific problems, but they are not recognised in the Bill. Parts of England and Scotland also have special needs. Gwynedd and Powys do not have some of the non-statutory and voluntary bodies on which the Bill will depend for its implementation. How will that gap be filled? Amendment No. 504 would provide a safety net. I hope that the Ministers will accept that housing and geographical and demographical needs should be included in the Bill from the beginning and not added on as afterthoughts when Opposition Members expose deficiencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) spoke of the need for flexibility in dealing with changes. What flexibility exists for Mrs. Jean George, who has been sitting in a wheelchair in 26 Maplin Road, Leicester, unable to get up the stairs of her house without the support of her husband and her son? She has been waiting for a visit from a social worker for 18 months to assess her needs. There are many others throughout the country who suffer great personal hardship because of the pressure on social service depts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised that matter during an Adjournment debate last year. The Minister said that he recognised the pressure on the occupational therapy service of local authorities, yet no constructive solution has been proposed for that problem. I agree with much of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe). For many years, I worked in the social services solicitors departments of the London boroughs of Richmond and Islington. In the early 1980s, I knew about pressure on social workers. They feared that they would make mistakes because of the enormous cuts that local authorities had to make and that, consequently, a child would be put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We covered most of that matter in the debates on the Children Bill, which started as a consensus bill, but it was guillotined by the Government, against the wishes of those who wanted to preserve that consensus. We stressed repeatedly to the then Minister of State, Department of Health, the honourable and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), that it was important to make those resources available to local authorities. We witnessed the removal of section 1 payments, which were a lifeline to many of those in great need of local support. The Minister assured us that those resources would be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44 enables the Secretary of State to use his powers to override legislation and the subjective decisions that must be made regarding the paramouncy of the child. The Minister gave no explanation of the circumstances in which the Secretary of State's powers would be used to override the substantive law created by the Children Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 551 deals with an issue that the Government should have embraced in the Bill. All hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1136</span>
Members are anxious about drugs misuse. As a member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, you know, Dame Janet, that we produced a report based on our experience in the United States of America. The Committee saw at first hand the problems relating to crack and what the future would be like in Britain if we refuse to take the necessary steps to prevent the misuse of drugs. Amendment No. 551 would give local authorities the required powers and resources to help those who are dependent on drugs or alcohol. Local authorities should have the Secretary of State's backing as they try to implement a strategy to cope with the great problem of the 1990s—the spread of crack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an Adjournment debate at the beginning of the parliamentary Session, both sides of the House listened carefully to the sincerity of the then Minister of State, Department of Health, when he said that resources would be made available to tackle crack. Even four years ago, crack was not a major problem in the United States. There were few reports of its spread in 1985. However, because of its nature, it has now spread throughout America and is a major drug in 49 of 50 states. Elected officials in major cities have even been involved. The warning cries from drug enforcement officers and the local authorities, which the Select Committee on Home Affairs visited, and which I visited in Washington a month ago, were that Britain should learn the lessons that America had not been able to learn because the drug had spread so widely and quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a drug of violence. Many of the incidents reported in New York, Washington and other major cities are fuelled by cocaine, either because people are under the drug's influence or because they engage in criminal activity to get the money to buy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cocaine has caused an increase in child abuse in America. A senior drug enforcement officer gave the latest figures to the Association of Chief Police Officers in Wales last year. He made the startling revelation that 73 per cent of children who had been battered to death in New York had had parents who were regular users of cocaine or crack. It is a drug that affects people of all races, sexes and social conditions simply because it is so cheap. It is alleged that women use it more than they have ever used any other drug.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 551 is very modest. It gives the Minister the opportunity of recognising how the drug has spread in America and is about to spread in this country. I do not want to speak in a debate in five years' time, when the figures are much worse than at present, and say to a Minister, who I hope will be a member of the Labour party, that the Government did not heed our warnings during the passage of this Bill through Standing Committee. The amendment would ensure that local authorities were allocated funds specifically to help people with drug problems. The Secretary of State should make funds available to local authorities so that they can fashion a comprehensive strategy to deal with drug abuse and drug users at a local level. Local authorities should be encouraged to make plans with the voluntary sector drugs services. That can only be done if the funds are made available.

freight of ideology: certainly, the Opposition have no desire to match the ideological contents of the clauses tabled by the Government. The amendments would protect our citizens, especially our young people, when they fall prey to those who deal in drugs. I hope that the Minister will accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Peniston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, as my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) also wishes to speak. I support ring-fencing although I should probably have opposed it eight or nine years ago. Block grants are fine so long as they are sufficiently resourced, and it is strange to hear them praised by people who since 1979 have sought to dilute the powers of local government. The rate support grant has been cut drastically each year, but at the same time the Government have sought to cap the facilities and the ability of local government to explain to the electorate the need for increases in rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the reverse of my trade union experience. One year we would seek a bonus, and the next year we would seek to have that consolidated into the base rate. The cycle would start again in the following year. The Government say that they will provide money for social services which local government must administer. I do not object to that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the block grant system is that the Government will claim that they have put in a certain sum this year, but in the following year they reduce the grant to local authorities. The Government will blame the local authorities for the lack of resources. I have no quarrel with any Government of any political persuasion who makes a grant to local authorities and then leaves them alone to run services and to raise money from their ratepayers
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 12 months ago the Government introduced the concept of poll tax. They said that it would make councils accountable to those whom they represent, even though three-quarters of that accountability would be removed by setting a unified business rate. Now they say that the poll tax will be capped, which removes accountability. So why should a Government who do that now want local authorities to be accountable on health matters? The answer is that the Government have adopted a step-by-step approach. They do a little this year, a little next year, and a little more the year after. The Government are gradually reducing local authority resources and moving the blame from central to local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government and their supporters are against the principles of ring-fencing, they should introduce a system that would enable everyone to know how much money every local authority receives for social services, so when cuts are made—be it in education or something else—we shall know whose fault it is. The facts can then be put to the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of why ring-fencing is necessary, even though is it against some of my principles. I have recently received a letter from the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment about the unified business rate. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All-in-all, then, business is getting a good long term deal
	<span class='label label-info column'>1138</span>
from the new system since it will be protected from real increases in the cost of local authority services. These will in future fall on the community charge payer."</p></blockquote>
Those few lines show how the Government are shifting the blame.

My local authority will levy a community charge of £230 or £240 against the Government's assessment of £220. More than 50 per cent of my local authority's expenditure goes on education and another huge chunk is spent on social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations has written to me because it is worried that local authorities will no longer have money to give voluntary organisations. I back all local authorities and local authority organisations, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Fight Against Alcoholism, the National Association of Health Authorities and the Royal College of Nursing. They all want ring-fencing and they all want central Government to be accountable. The amount of money that each local authority will receive each year should be publicised. We can than see where the blame lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I looked forward to this debate to tell members of the committee about my thoughts over the years on local authority funding. Unlike many of my hon. Friends I have never had trouble accepting the principle of ring-fencing. Indeed, I would have widened it considerably. I have increasingly found the arguments deployed in support of the principle of local democratic accountability to be empty, especially with the decline of Government allocations. Socialists can deploy an argument whereby we can preserve democratic accountability and ring-fence all local authority budgets if only to preserve a base level of provision within every service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of nursery education. Local authorities make different provision for nursery education. I do not wish to score political points, but authorities of a certain political persuasion are less inclined to make provision than others of another political persuasion. My view, as a Socialist, is that local authority should not have the right to determine that the provision of nursery education is not needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) intervened. A local authority should not have that right because in the society which I wish to develop under a Labour Government there would be countrywide provision of certain forms of education, of which one is nursery education. I am still dealing with the amendment, Dame Janet, and I am trying to present my arguments on ring-fencing in a way that the Committee will readily understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech which I am trying hard to follow. Would not the effect of his statement be that local authorities would become no more than central Government agents, which would destroy the value of a separate electoral register and a separate set of elections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0970">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1139</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a solid argument against my view. To some extent, that is the case, but it depends on one's view of the meaning of local accountability. With various ring-fenced budgets local Government could be changed to a system which has to concentrate not on how much money is spent but on how effectively it is spent. Democratic accountability might mean the proper and efficient use of resources, rather than raising rates to prove to the electorate that more money will be spent willingly in a particular area. The bureaucratic structure and the lack of accountability in local authorities and Government Departments means that they are bound to waste money. If we wish to preserve the concept of local accountability, local officials and councillors must be accountable at a local level for the money that they spend. The only way to do that is to develop a suitable form of local authority system. If one accepts that argument, one might accept the principle of capping the budgets of all local authorities. One could extend that argument to local government funding. Local authorities would raise no revenue and receive their money from national Government, so political parties would compete locally about the efficient use of resources and the provision of services. I may be in the minority in the Labour party in advancing that proposition, but that is a far better way in which to ensure that money is used properly than local authorities saying simply that they must raise the rate because they want to spend more on nursery education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one accepts my proposition, one is talking in terms of base provision and of ensuring that a Labour voter in Surrey has the same access to nursery education as a Labour voter in Manchester or in parts of Scotland, which has some exceedingly well-resourced authorities that spend their money well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman presents an interesting hypothesis, but experience of life shows that unless people are accountable in some way for raising money, those who spend end up by being constantly in conflict with those who pay. That is the evidence of history and the hon. Gentleman probably finds that in his family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand what the hon. Gentleman is driving at. When I read what he said, I presume that I shall understand the subtlety of his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is that if we provide a base level of services, we should not intellectually throw out the principle of accepting ring-fencing on a wider front to cover housing, highways, education and every other area of local authority expenditure. That is not my party's position, but I hope that it will be one day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument has not been lost. We have a responsibility to the people in those areas that will never experience a Labour-controlled authority. It is hard to convince the burghers of Sussex that the Labour party would act in their interests. I claim that it would, but the cultural characteristics of the population make it difficult to convince people. Labour authorities would be elected with great difficulty in parts of Surrey and Sussex, so Labour voters there may be denied forever the provision of critical services that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1140</span>
are available in my part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) pointed out that the representations made to him suggested that ring-fencing was necessary to ensure the safeguarding of the budget against future Government cuts. It would identify an expansion in the budget to meet this demand, in isolation from other areas of local authority provision. To all intents and purposes my authority—Cumbria county council—is Labour-controlled. Therefore, I am picking on the problems facing not a Conservative, but a Labour authority when it must juggle the figures to meet its expenditure requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next year, my authority wishes to spend £271 million on public services, having already made cuts. Further cuts would involve closing schools and homes, sacking teachers and social workers. Every pound of that figure must come from somewhere. In order to spend that money, the Government have had to levy a poll tax, which is £81.70 greater than the standard spending assessment. That assessment is laid down by the Government and provides for £246 million only. The authority therefore has to find an extra £33,198,000 unless if wants to cut further services. What can it close? We have rural schools in our counties. Will they be closed down? Even Conservative parents are saying that that should not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative voters are often the most articulate bodies in opposing the Government's education cuts. They have harangued their councils and Members of Parliament because they are worried about what is happening to our schools. They believe that they can influence events, but sometimes they forget that the responsibility lies with the Government. Further cuts cannot be found within the education service without closing more vital schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might also be faced with cuts in the fire-emergency and planning services. Our standard spending assessment suggests that £7 million should be spent, but even that is £1 million less than the former up-dated grant related expenditure assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Fascinating though this is, we seem to have strayed rather a long way from the principle of ring-fencing. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could speak to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for me to decide upon that. However, the hon. Member for Workington should know that although I am prepared to allow passing reference to other matters to illustrate a point, there is a danger of straying too far from the basis of the amendments. He should focus his remarks to the specific amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do that, Dame Janet. We cannot meet the Government's target on highways; nor on fire-emergency planning. It will be difficult to meet the Government's targets on the police. The social security budget is more than £3 million less than our requirements. The whole county's budget, as I said, is some £33 million down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0971">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1141</span>
The problem will worsen when the money comes through the new systems. What will happen when that money reaches the county budgets? If there is no ring-fencing, pressure on the local authority—perhaps from a Tory parent worried about saving a rural school—will mount. Under those conditions politicians must play politics with the local community . They may not want to as they are elected to defend local communities, but might be driven into it. In may areas, local politicians might want to purloin part of the budget for expenditure on highways, education, police, fire-emerency and planning and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Nuclear Fuels Limited is based in our county. We would need vast resources to deal with a future emergency. Yet our budget, as in other areas, is under pressure. We should not give a lump sum of money to Cumbria county council, which might be under different control. It would be difficult to protect funds under pressure from competing areas of resource. Every area requires money to be spent, but specific areas must be identified and ring-fenced to avoid potential loss of monies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillors of all political persuasions might give assurances today about their wish to safeguard certain services from potential cuts. The Minister had evidence, based on a survey, that social services departments and their councils would be able to protect social services budgets. As the Government intend, the poll tax will put pressure on local authorities to identify the level of poll tax with the problems of individuals within the community. They will be under pressure to contain their budgets, especially in the light of increases that we have heard about recently. There is a danger that money for social services budgets will be transferred to other headings of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accepted the principle of ring-fencing decades ago, when I changed my views on the financing of local government, and I was in a minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should earnestly consider our proposal as a way forward. If they do not, money will be lost and there will be recriminations against local authorities. In answer to the question why money is not available, the Minister will say, "But we have made the money available to the local authority. It is inflation-proofed this year. The money was there for spending, and it is up to the local authority to decide how it should be spent." Ministers will conveniently forget that local authorities are short on funding for education, police, fire and emergency services, highways and every other aspect of expenditure. They are under pressure to spend in all those sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would prevent Ministers having to give such replies at the Disptach Box. It may be accurate that the budgets are inflation-proofed, but they may include moneys that have not found their way through to the sectors that we are targeting for special sensitive expenditure in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond to all the points made by my hon. Friends and by Opposition Members and to keep my remarks concise. I shall reply to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1142</span>
hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) when he returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke), for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay) spoke about the central mechanism for determining additions to the revenue support grant. I draw a distinction between the argument pursued by the hon. Gentlemen and that of Sir Roy Griffiths. The hon. Member for Monklands, West placed great reliance on the Griffiths report in relation to ring-fencng and earmarking funds. I distinguish between Sir Roy and the Labour party because, on this issue, they argue from a different basis and come to different conclusions. I shall try to persuade the hon. Gentleman that there is a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition argue about the level of funding. The hon. Member for Workington. (Mr. Campbell-Savours) believes that the standard spending assessments are too low. The extension of that argument is that they would want ring-fencing in personal social services for the new money—that is new money for those who are freshly assessed after 1 April—and for the old money, too. That is the only logical position that they can adopt. The hon. Member for Workington went further and argued, "Why stop there?" The logic of the argument is to ring-fence all aspects of local government authority. But he stopped at standard assessment and I submit that he must carry the argument a stage further. In addition to the SSA is the movement of cash. The Government estimate how much money can be raised from business and from the poll tax payer; they deduct that from the SSA to obtain the aggregate external finance, which is paid over in revenue support grant and specific grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Member for Workington one stage further. He must be prescriptive about the powers that central Government should have to raise the additional amounts needed for local authorities, which means the amounts coming from the poll tax payer and business. Then he can ring-fence the cash budgets for each individual part of local authority expenditure. But we are not following that course because that is a complete abrogation of what local government should be. When I conclude my remarks in a few minutes' time, I shall argue for a different approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingstone has just come back into the Committee. He said that I was wrong and he was right. I chose my words carefully and, if he checks the record, he will see that I referred only to revenue support grant and not rate support grant. In the past, some personal social services authorities may not have received rate support grant. But I give the hon. Gentleman the assurance for which, by implication, he asks; Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Westminster, which are all personal social services authorities under the revenue support grant regime that will commence in a month's time, will receive such a grant. There will be no exceptions. When the hon. Gentleman inevitably checked his facts with the Association of Metropolitan Authorities he probably looked at the ancien régime and not the new one. I hope that he will be satisfied with that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1143</span>
Perhaps I may finish my comments about Roy Griffiths. He was asked to examaine not funding for social services authorities but only the incremental funding for those that were newly assessed. His arguments for earmarking were not those of the hon. Members for Workington, for Monklands, West and their colleagues. He argued that the funds must reach the right department and that there should be stability in funding. As for getting the funds to the right department, I said earlier that the track record of social services departments was very good. Perhaps Sir Roy Griffiths and the hon. Member for Workington fear that when money is available—raised from the revenue support grant, specific grants, the business community and poll tax payers—the social services departments will do badly. But that is not borne out by experience, because they have done well. Sir Roy and the Government part company in that respect. An examination of the record shows that his fears are not well placed. A second factor was his concern about the stability of funding. We have made it clear how we envisage that the system will work. I shall respond to the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones), who asked what the funding level would be. But we have provided stability by clearly outlining what the new principles will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that local authorities have been effective in protecting their social services budgets, and he has some figures to hand. But it is true that they—in the main, Labour authorities—have done so by taking on the Government and by affronting local government legislation in terms of what moneys they should spend over and above their GREAs? Surely that is what has happened. If they had followed Government edict, the Minister could not cite those figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Social services departments have done comparatively well, and not only in relation to other departments for a variety of reasons. Indeed, I quoted a 37 per cent increase in real terms over 10 years. That creditable record is due, no doubt, to pressure on central Government, to rating policy—in future, that will be poll tax charges—and to the efficiency with which departments operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West asked how we could ensure that local authorities were complying if we did not ring-fence. I understand that argument, although I do not agree with it. Logically, the argument has to be extended, as the hon. Member for Workington extended it in an intellectually honest way, to all aspects of local authority expenditure, because it could also be applied to transport, housing, the environment, and all other aspects of government. That would logically lead to central Government control of all local authority expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West also asked whether the amount of new money would be a public figure. Of course, it will be a relatively modest sum, because it will be only the amount of money necessary to care for those who come into assessment after 1 April. Therefore, in the first year, the old sum of money spent by local authorities on domiciliary care
	<span class='label label-info column'>1144</span>
and other such local authority expenditure will continue. The new figure, as a national aggregate, will be in the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) on mental health more fully later, as the hon. Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and for Wakefield raised the same subject. But my hon. Friend also mentioned alcohol and drugs, as did the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). I shall deal with the problem of cocaine in my concluding remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the problems caused by alcohol and drugs. I have been to Ealing to see the provision for schizophrenics in the community. I should like to go there again, to see how local authorities and health authorities work together to provide services for those who are dependent on alcohol and drugs. I shall take up my hon. Friend's implied invitation to make an early visit, because I share his interest. However, I do not believe that specific grants are necessarily the right way to tackle those two problems. But I am concerned about the amount of funding, and my hon. Friend is right to draw attention to it when dealing with paragraph 8.19 of the White Paper on community care My hon. Friend essentially asked how the funds would move in practice, because frail elderly ladies in residential homes could not be expected to manage all the various aspects of housing benefit, income support, support from the social services department, and perhaps charges levied by that department. The Government are addressing their minds to that problem. I cannot give a comprehensive answer this afternoon, but I hope to shortly. We want a simple, unbureaucratic system which will mean that the transfer of money to clients, and clients paying it back to the local authorities does not become complicated—it must be simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wakefield said that there was not much on record about the specific grant proposals for mental health. Therefore, I shall briefly outline the six key elements of those proposals. First, we suggest that the regional health authorities should make money available to social services departments for the provision of mental health services. I hope that those departments will work with housing authorities, which are district councils in the shires. That is where the districts will clearly play a role, although it will not be in the transmission of money from the Health Service to local authorities. It is sensible to work through RHAs simply because they are larger than the districts and correspond, certainly in the shires, to the greater size of personal social services departments. Of course, the regions are also responsible for the policy of moving some patients from the large mental illness and mental handicap hospitals which are run on a regional basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I understand the Under-Secretary correctly as saying that there will be no transfer of money for housing? Does that mean that there will be no new money for housing needs of the type that we debated earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0973">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1145</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are my third and fifth points. I am still on my second point that regional health authorities will make the payment on the basis of specific plans submitted by the social services departments. In order words, the earmarked money will cease to be paid once such plans are approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, money will be made available to fund both capital and revenue schemes. Fourthly, we regard the money as a form of pump priming, which means that there will be no indefinite commitment to funding. In the sense, it is similar to joint finance. I appreciate the problems that local authorities may have because of the taper that may be involved in some of the revenue funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, new money will be provided by the Treasury. The hon. Member for Livingston asked for a commitment on that. The distribution of the money will be a mechanical accounting problem. Inevitably, the aggregate external finance will have to be top-sliced for the revenue support grant to be calculated. Additional money will come from the taxpayer and will go through the bidding process for the public expenditure survey in the normal way. We are in the early stages of calculating how much it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixthly, we intend to monitor the success of the grant through the social services inspectorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is genuine, unlike many other interventions. The Under-Secretary said that an assessed amount of new money would be made available. Will that amount be greater than the amount that would otherwise have been spent through the DSS on the support of those in residential care? If it stays the same, it will not go near to meeting the expectations raised by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The money will be separate and additional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) asked how much money would be made available. Additional resources will be required over and above the public expenditure survey transfer, which is the amount that would have been spent on the social care element of income support by the Department of Social Security in the year 1991–92. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health made it clear in earlier debates that community care would have to be funded adequately, and clearly, therefore, new money will have to be found for the introduction of the system and the new assessment mechanisms. That is a matter for detailed discussion in Government. Additional investment will have to be made in facilities that provide domiciliary care. We are under no illusions about the fact that the new system will have to be financed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones (Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for clarifying that point, but I am sure that the Department has already assessed the additional cost, perhaps for the first year of the community care scheme. Will the Under-Secretary tell the Committee what the assessment is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot. The public expenditure
	<span class='label label-info column'>1146</span>
procedure that has just started will run for several months, and my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State will make an announcement towards the end of the year. That is the normal procedure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be made in November?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The normal procedure for assessing priorities and needs will be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for answering the question that I posed earlier, but I have another. He mentioned mental illness and mental handicap almost in the same breath. The government ring-fence grant for mental illness, but not for mental handicap. That has always been a mystery to some hon. Members especially to those who have worked in health care. Will he explain the Government's stance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that mental handicap funds have been ring-fenced for a long time in that, when patients are transferred from hospitals to the community, money follows them. The so-called dowries of £19,000 per annum, together with lump sums, are paid from health authorities to local authorities. My hon. Friend knows also that they are ring-fenced in that, when a hospital closes, the proceeds must stay within the service, though that service is not necessarily provided by the Department of Health; it could be provided by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister and the Committee bear in mind that what he said about dowries does not apply to Scotland? That might be helpful to us later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Scottish Office is extremely enlightened in its policy towards provision for the mentally ill and handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) made a good suggestion, which I am happy to accept on behalf of my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State. On behalf of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, my hon. Friend said that we should have a review by the Audit Commission on value for money after, say, three years. I shall pass the suggestion on to the Audit Commission, which I shall be seeing shortly. I am sure that it will be well-received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) about ring-fencing inhibiting local authorities and cooperation between them and other statutory authorities. I say to him, to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry Mr. Boswell) and to hon. Gentlemen who spoke about the need to take account of the geographical area in settling standard spending assessments that that is understood. That factor must be taken into account when settling standard spending assessments in relation to personal social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) talked about ring-fencing. I say to him and the hon. Members for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) and for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0974">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1147</span>
that the only logical extension of their argument is that all personal social services expenditure be ring-fenced, both new money and old, and that all local authority expenditure and cash expenditure, including that raised from poll tax payers and from businesses, be ring-fenced, too. We do no intend to go down that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry about the need for more regional provision for some patients. He mentioned those who need intensive head care and those with Huntington's chorea. There are economies of scale, with districts working together to provide the service. It does not necessarily involve new money and resources. It is an important point which the Department of Health will pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked about training research grants. We already have the power to make special grants for social service training, but when my right honourable and learned Friend sets the budget for 1991–1992 he will take into account the need for training and research in community care.

In response to the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz), who has left the Room—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. My hon. Friend has had to leave on urgent constituency business. A bomb has exploded under a lorry in Leicester.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Leicester, East addressed his remarks to the need for additional resources to fight cocaine abuse. As my hon. Friend the member for Mid-Kent said, different Government Departments such as the Department for Health and the Department of Education and the police and local authorities must all co-operate on that. We need an advertising campaign, and an announcement will be made shortly in the House of Lords by my noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health, Baroness Hooper, who has responsibility for the matter. I shall pass on the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent to my noble Friend. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Finally, I shall deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) about housing the homeless mentally ill. He is right to draw attention to that problem, although it is not appropriate now to explain why in Greater London there are roughly 3,000 homeless mentally ill, and perhaps 500 in central London. We have taken a variety of steps, which are mentioned in paragraph 7, to ensure that we do not add to the problem. We have ensured that our discharge policies from hospitals are correct and that we do not close hospitals willy nilly so that patients are discharged into the community without proper care. Local authorities will be obliged to have a proper care programme for the mentally ill from 1 April 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are anxious to deal with the historic
	<span class='label label-info column'>1148</span>
problem, and we hope soon to bring forward proposals which will be based, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth rightly suggested, on providing hostel and long-term accommodation, and on working with local authorities. I hope that that answers all the hon. Gentleman's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the Under-Secretary of State for Health was marked by characteristic courtesy and an informative attempt to reply to our questions. To that extent, it provided a pleasing contrast with his speech before lunch. We much prefer the Under-Secretary when he is not hungry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to observe the by-play between the Under-Secretary and the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), who properly teased out from the Under-Secretary the admission that later this evening, when we shall debate another subsection of the clause, the Under-Secretary will defend an arrangement to ring-fence community care payments for the mentally ill. I notice that he defended ring-fencing community care for the mentally ill by calling on the precedent set by ring-fencing for the mentally handicapped. What, then, is the great principle by which community care for the elderly cannot be ring-fenced?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Gentlemen rebuked me earlier this morning for my lack of logical rigour because I supported the rights of local authorities and ring-fencing. Will any of those hon. Gentlemen challenge the principle of ring-fencing when it is applied to the mentally ill or mentally handicapped? Logic binds them to do that. The debate had other ironies and contradictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had only two debates since we commenced this morning. The first involved the Minister defending the necessity for central Government to retain the power to direct the directors of social services authorities in case they were doing something unacceptable. In the second debate the Minister said the inverse: that it would be wrong for social services authorities to be constrained by central powers because a ring-fenced grant would be given to them. Those two positions are not consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to found their case on the fact that social services authorities are run by wonderful, trustworthy people who know local priorities and what will make care in the community work. If those people can be trusted to make the right judgment, the Under-Secretary and his Back Benchers should listen to what they say about the need for an earmarked, ring-fenced grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe). I point out to him what Mr. Norman Warner, the director of social services covering Kent, has said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By turning their back on ring-fencing and specific grants, the Government now runs the serious risk of damaging the prospects of the fundamentally sensible reforms it is advocating."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that I go along with every word in that sentence. However, one can see the thrust of the observations on ring-fencing. Mr. Warner continued:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0975">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1149</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Financial safeguards for community care, like ring-fencing, bridging funds and specific grants, are essential if it is to be delivered in the next decade and beyond. Without these safeguards, acute beds will become clogged up through the absence of continuing care services, and parliamentarians and their relatives will have a more miserable old age."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I have discussed the matter with my director of social services, who is, as the hon. Gentleman implied, an honourable fellow, and one recognises special pleading wherever it arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am not sure that the director of social services in Kent will recognise the hon. Member as an admirable fellow when he reads that comment. Nor does it answer the Director's point that he, exercising his judgment that the person on the ground will be charged with this new responsibility, is making about the importance of an earmarked grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter for a local government officer to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) undervalues the extent to which the development of services is a process of negotiation, debate and discussion between officers and elected members. This is the way that it operates in the most constructive local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way, but the hon. Member is wide of the matters under debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was for eight years a councillor of a London borough, I was also a member of the Inner London Education Authority and have served as a local government officer. The quotation that the hon. Gentleman has just read from the director of social services in Kent oversteps the mark between what the officers and politicians have said. Theses matters are for politicians to decide. He has not ready any quotation from the leader of Kent county council or the chairman of the social services committee of Kent county council. These are matters for politicians and I am surprised the hon. Gentleman says that these are matters on which officers' opinions are more important at the end of the day than those of the politicians. If senior civil servants made such statements in a period of Labour Government, he would not believe that that was the right position from which to make public statements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting insight into the extent to which the hon. Gentleman is prepared to allow freedom of debate and freedom of expression among those who work in the public sector. I can only commend Kent county council for allowing its director of social services the freedom to write in a respectable and reputable social services magazine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if the hon. Gentleman was present when I addressed the Committee earlier, but I referred to the mountain of evidence provided by elected members through the official local authority associations, all consistently in support of earmarked, ring-fenced grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
Moving to the issue between the Front Benches, I am happy to accept with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary a draw on the basis that I am right for the present that there are some local authorities which do not receive rate support grant, and that he will be right next year when all social services authorities will receive revenue support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had been asked ten years ago whether we would have a situation in which any local authority ended up without rate support grant, we would have regarded it as inconceivable. I retain an open mind about whether we may not still drift into that situation under the new regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the point of the debate is this. The problem for all those authorities which currently receive the rate support grant and the slightly larger number in receipt of the revenue support grant in the future is that, if the money channelled to them for the care in the community comes through that major grant, it will not be clear—measured against that mega-grant—what the Government are giving for care in the community or what they should be spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the nub of the matter, and the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) was fair when he referred to this. If one could be confident that adequate new money would be put in, ring-fencing would become a minor problem. I am sceptical whether the large amount of money needed will be provided. The most worrying comment to come out of the debate was when the Secretary of State assured the Committee that there was no sinister battle between him and the Treasury. I should be much happier if there was a sinister battle between him and the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not sufficient for the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to dismiss our concern about adequate funding —because our concern is necessarily and unavoidably based on current level funding—by telling us that current spending levels are irrelevant to a debate about an incremental level of spending. If there is under-funding, of course, the current level of spending is relevant. In those circumstances, any increment will be hailed as a welcome relief to stave off cuts. It is inconceivable that a social services authority already underfunded, perhaps facing a poll tax of £400, will embark on expanding any social service. If any of them does, we all know what will happen to it next. Hon. Member's will know what would happen next if they attended Prime Minister's Questions earlier this afternoon. If authorities embark on that expansion of service, they will be denounced as irresponsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon, we even heard mid-Devon denounced as being irresponsible for high spending. There are mutterings in the press about poll tax capping for a wide range of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I invite the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), then, before he casts his vote, to address his mind, in the context of this debate, to what will happen to the new developments in community care in the event of a poll tax capping?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consider the scenario. A local authority has a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0976">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
standard spending assessment from the Government worse than its current level of social service spending. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary gives it an increment in resources for care in the community. It does not cut its social service spending in order to bring it into line with the standard spending assessment; it uses the new money not to plug the gap but to develop additional facilities in care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along comes the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and lobbies the Department of Environment to apply a full tax cap to it. The authority finds that it has a cap put on its expenditure. In these cirmcustances, the authority can forget about any expansion for community care facilities because it will be grubbing around for every penny to shore up existing levels of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member, but this must be last occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has again got it wrong. First, if my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) lobbied the Department of Environment on the basis that he described, immediately the local authority would take the Secretary of State to the High Court for a judicial review, and probably succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only occasion when the Government can quite properly step in and cap a community charge is when that charge is unreasonable and excessively high. That completely counters the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman is legally qualified and on that basis will no doubt be available to those local authorities which wish to seek a judicial review of the Secretary of State's decision to apply a poll tax cap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one who has sat through many debates about the expenditure cap applied to Lothian region under the previous regime, I warn the hon. Gentleman that what is or is not unreasonable has always been resolved by the parliamentary arithmetic of Conservative Members. In Lothian region, we have seen home helps thrown out of work and those dependent on home helps losing them because of the cap on expenditure applied by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to my conclusion, as the Committee must come to a decision. I rather fear, however, that the decision will not be enhanced by any greater length at which I may speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially, what worries the local authorities that have begged for a ring-fenced earmarked round is that, once again, they are to be given fresh responsibilities without adequate resources. This will result in their making the sorts of decisions that my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield outlined. Junior directors of social services departments will end up juggling respective expenditure on community and residential care and on children on the risk register. They will have to make constant decisions about whether to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
provide home helps for people who claim to need them or whether to give assistance and supervision to a child who is obviously at risk. The Bill will create a position whereby assessments are carried out without services being available to meet the relevant needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have low expectations that any decision taken in Committee will produce the funds necessary to make care in the community a reality. The least that we can do is to ensure that the structure for funding is visible for all to see, thereby making it difficult for Ministers to short-change local authorities as they undertake their new responsibilities. That is the least protection that we can offer to the vulnerable people who will depend on the services of community care. It is a modest enough protection: I recommend the Committee to extend it to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 31 in page 44, line 38, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"7E. The Secretary of State shall establish a national agency (to be known as the "Quality Commission") to draw up standards for community care services, monitor service quality and disseminate best practice between providers.".</p></blockquote>
We know from the earlier debate that the Secretary of State is taking powers to direct social services authorities on the content of their community care plans. The reason he thinks that the government need these new central powers of direction, which will enable them to enforce their wishes on local authorities, is that they wish to be sure that, no matter what the local circumstances, local authorities will be obliged to introduce what Conservatives euphemistically call the mixed economy in domiciliary services. The power to direct is the tool with which the Government will enforce privatisation of domiciliary services on local authorities for their community care plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know also that the Government plan to cheat on the cash that is to be made available for community care. When the Minister spoke about the current resources available for social services, it became clear that they cheat on these figures year after year. They are now presiding over the erosion of the all-important social services base on which community care provision is intended to be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) made it clear that the base was under threat because the standard spending assessment on social services was lower than the amount spent on social services this year. The idea is to give social services authorities difficult choices: either they strip out their social services departments to ensure that they do not levy too high a poll tax and cripple individual payers, or, to protect the services, they load a high tax on to individual payers. That is the background against which the amendment becomes so important. We know that the drive towards the mixed economy of these services—the privatisation—will mean a reduction in the cash available for community care. Therefore it is important that safeguards are written chapter and verse into the Bill to protect the quality of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considerable fears about the extent of community services. The elderly have more difficulty getting home helps now than 10 years ago because growing demand for home care services could not be met by expansion in social services provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a major worry about quality, but we also have a major worry about quality. We have heard a lot of nonsense from the Government and Conservative Members about the importance of quality of care, but if there is no cash for high-quality services, how can high quality of care be achieved? If there are no inspection procedures or inspectorate to make sure that the services are of high quality, how can high quality of care be ensured? We do not want public relations statements about quality delivered in smooth tones; we want proper guarantees for quality of care, particularly in domiciliary services. There is nothing in the Bill to guarantee and safeguard quality of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
There is a registration procedure, and we welcome the Registered Homes Act for the registration of private residential care. But there is no registration procedure for domiciliary services and non-residential services. We are talking here about the expansion of private day centres, which are a new development—there are hardly any at present—and of private care attendance schemes. There are some excellent voluntary organisations for private care attendance, such as Crossroads, but there are very few of them, and there will be a development in the market there. There are also very few private home help agencies, but, thanks to the Secretary of State's powers of direction, there will no doubt be a major expansion there, and it is the same with meals-on-wheels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies to the debate, he must say how the quality of care in those services will be monitored. Let me give an example of what might happen. Thanks to the Secretary of State's powers of direction, a home help comes round to someone from a private agency rather than from the council, and the person phones up the council and says, "She only came for half the time she was supposed to come. She did hardly any of the things that she was supposed to do. I had hardly any of the services which I was supposed to get." The council rings up the agency and says, "We have a complaint from Mrs. Jones. She says that she had hardly any of the services from the home help that she was meant to get." The agency will say, "Well, of course, Mrs. Jones is confused and elderly, which is why she is getting home help."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How on earth will the quality and delivery of services be monitored in a fragmented market? The Registered Nursing Home Association has expressed concern about what it describes as the cowboy element entering the residential care home private market. What on earth will happen when the cowboy element enters the domiciliary services? It will have the rich pickings of the Government's planned privatisation of home helps and care attendance schemes. The Secretary of State really must deal with our concerns about the matter, because the quality of the service is a key factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Continuity of care—whether the care attendance service is provided by the same person or the agency sends a different person each week—is important. Many people, wanting to keep their dignity and privacy, have to be persuaded to accept domiciliary services and feel that they are losing their independence in allowing a person from outside the family to perform very personal services for them. Obviously, if they need those services, it is a good idea to accept them, so that they do not have to go into residential care. But how can we be sure that the agencies will not send a different home help every week to the same person, which will substantially undermine the quality of care as it is perceived by the recipient of the service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we make sure that the agencies which provide the domiciliary care service train their staff to an adequate standard in order to improve the quality of that service rather than give the cheapest service possible? How will the changes introduced in the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0978">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
be monitored? It is particularly important to monitor them because of the underfunding inherent in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since we tabled amendment No. 31, it has attracted a great deal of support. It has clearly struck a chord with many outside organisations concerned with the delivery of domiciliary and other care services under the community care section of the Bill. In particular, I should like warmly to welcome the support of the Royal College of Nursing, which has contacted all its members and expressed in perhaps even clearer terms than I have why it feels that the amendment is important. I commend the amendment to the Committee and hope that we can have some guarantees from the Minister. We are asking for a national setting of standards and inspection by an independent body. I hope that the Minister will recognise that we are talking about the frailest, the most vulnerable and the most dependent people in society. They cannot monitor the services themselves. They should have a say in the planning of the services and the types of services which are delivered to them, but they cannot police them. We as a community will have to police them, and we must see in the Bill how they will be monitored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have an example of the privatisation of certain services which would be useful in this argument. The domestic services in the National Health Service have been privatised. Domestics in the NHS were always more than just cleaners. After privatisation, there was a massive staff turnover, particularly on long-stay wards, and the continuity which came from having a regular team looking after the elderly people was lost. Agencies will go for lower pay, because the only way to make a profit out of doing the work privately is to pay much lower wages and increase the workload.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I back up what my hon. Friend says, and I hope that the Minister will deal with that pertinent point when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In precisely two minutes, I shall try to deal with the arguments which have been deployed. First, there is no question of the Government forcing competitive tendering upon local authorities for home help services or forcing the privatisation of the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not competitive tendering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or privatisation. There is absolutely no proposal in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with the central argument of the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms Harman) on amendment No. 31 and a national agency. We are not persuaded that a national agency is called for, because we think that it would be a duplication of what is in place and what we propose to augment. We also think that there is a danger that it could become rather costly and bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three ways in which quality can be monitored. First, all local authorities will have a duty to inspect and, through guidance which we shall issue,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1156</span>
we shall set out how local authorities could inspect. That inspection must be at arm's length, of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nationally, there is the social services inspectorate and there is the health advisory service to help advise and monitor on national quality standards and draw attention to Ministers and the local authorities where those standards fall short. In short, we do not accept that a national agency is needed, and I advise hon. Members to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If local authorities are so trustworthy, why does the Secretary of State need the power to direct? If they are both the purchasers of the services and the monitors, surely the functions should be separated. If the inspectorate is so powerful, why does the Secretary of State need the power to direct local authorities? The point is that there is a gap. The Government do not plan to tackle that problem, and I hope that we shall return to the subject of quality later in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 748, in page 44, line 38, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"7E. The Secretary of State for Health shall lay before Parliament an annual report setting out the resources expended by each local authority in connection with the exercise of their social services functions under Part 3 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>7F. The Secretary of State for Wales shall lay before Parliament an annual report setting out the resources expended by each local authority in connection with the exercise of their social services functions under Part 3 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.".</p></blockquote>
It is just possible that I can speak to the amendment before the Division bell rings. The Secretary of State has taken considerable powers to direct local authorities in a wide range of circumstances, including the preservation of quality.
