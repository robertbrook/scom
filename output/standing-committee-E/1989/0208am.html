	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It is not our intention to move amendment No. 722 or new clause 20. It might be convenient to take amendment No. 591 to clause 38 with amendment No. 592 to clause 37; although they relate to different-clauses they cover an identical point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION AND WELFARE SERVICES: AGENCY ARRANGEMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 580, in page 38, line 25, after 'arrangements', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'registered with a Board specified under section (Registration Council and Boards) below'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this, we may take new clause 13—Registration Council and Boards—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(()—(1) In section 20(1) of the Registered Homes Act 1984 the following words shall be inserted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"General Registration Council" means a body representing the Secretary of state, local authorities and health authorities set up to determine the business of "Regional Registration Boards".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regional Registration Boards" means a body representing local authorities, and health regional interests regarding registration and inspection matters including care standards and costs of inspection and registration relating to all community care services (with the meaning of section 41(2) of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990) under which local authorities shall have majority representation.'.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is delighted now that we have reached consideration of community care. I think that we all agree that it is a profoundly important aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 580 and new clause 13 deal with an important aspect of community care which has undergone much discussion in the reports of Griffiths and Wagner. The thrust of the amendment and new clause is to accept the shift towards a more mixed economy provision of community care. The Government and Opposition agree that that shift is necessary. We should seize the opportunity provided by the Bill to ensure that the right care is provided, as we are dealing with the care of the elderly. Therefore, our proposals for the inspectorate's roles and for the method of inspection, are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important also that arrangements for inspections and lines of accountability are established evenly in each
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
sector. We make no distinction in the standards that should be set in both the public and private sectors. We accept that there have been grievous errors in both sectors and we shall not attempt to whitewash those this morning. It is important to ensure that the inspectorate is correctly established; that is the aim of our amendments and new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the inspectorate's role, the method of inspection and its accountability should be to the advantage of the consumer. Our proposals for the board include consumer participation, as well as the participation of those who are responsible for registering and providing the services that would come under inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our proposals the system of regional boards would provide a mechanism for the broad representation of relevant interests, including those of health and housing bodies, and voluntary organisations. It would include users' interests as well as those of local authority social services. It is self-evident that it would embrace almost everybody involved in service provision, and would ensure accountability, inspection and the continued discussion of best practice. Best practice even in terms of inspection, may exist in parts of the country, but we want to extend it throughout the United Kingdom. There are regional variations in service provisions, local authority input, consumer needs and even levels of deprivation. Apart from ensuring national standards, regional boards, because they would operate at a regional level, could more easily become involved in monitoring, which I am sure all Committee members accept is essential if the system is to work. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities wants —this seems to me to be reasonable—local government representation to play a major role on the regional registration boards because of the key functions envisaged for local authority social service departments. I am not sure what the Government's thinking is on that, but I remind the Minister that even Sir Roy Griffiths, who considered an enormous amount of evidence on the matter including the report of the Audit Commission for England and Wales, took the view that the lead role in community care should be provided by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am impressed by the hon. Gentleman's measured tones and by the fact that he seemed to suggest that there was no reason to suppose that standards are, or would be, any lower in private homes than in those run by local authorities. A newspaper report which describes how the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury opened Arlestown View nursing home, a private nursing home at 4 Underhill avenue, Derby, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it not only complies with all the fire and health authority regulations, it encompasses the very latest in aids for the elderly and disabled."</p></blockquote>
By contrast, an investigation into the Nye Bevan local authority home, revealed that the incontinent were punished by being left unattended, and old people were deliberately helped to die. The hon. Gentleman mentioned local authority control—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is supposed to be intervening. If he wishes to speak in the debate, I shall be happy to call him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Those examples have been used before in Committee. For the benefit of those Committee members who will be bored to death if we have to hear them again,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
will you rule that all Committee members sit quietly for two minutes while the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) gets the matter off his chest? We could then continue with the business of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard no tedious repetition, but if I do hear it I shall act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) genuinely believed that our debate started on a high level, it is regrettable that he has lowered that level so quickly. The Opposition want excellence of inspections in both the private and public sectors, and we shall accept no less. It would be easy for hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to produce examples of outrageous conduct, because, sadly, it exists in both public and private sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It exists much more in the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree; it exists more in the private sector because of the lack of inspection. We want to find a method that will make abuses impossible. Inspection will take into account the role of all the parties involved, including the consumer, whom we have not heard much about so far. I hope that that balance will be corrected in community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve the best method of inspection, the local authorities, who have been given a major responsibility in the Griffiths report, will be given a major role in forming policy and in conducting arm's length inspections. I believe that that is the Government's thinking as well; the Minister for Health might confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Member's motives and the moderate way in which he advanced his argument. But does he think it wise to leave provision in the same hands as regulation? One could argue that when provision and regulation are broadly divided—where poacher and gamekeeper are not the same —there is a better chance of achieving the higher standards that he and my hon. Friends want to achieve. the evidence of the Nye Bevan home suggests that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman eventually reads the amendment and the new clause, he will see that that is precisely what we are trying to avoid. That is why we have talked about arm's length inspection. We do not agree with self-regulation in that area; quite the reverse. All the evidence suggests that self-regulation does not work. Its failure is especially clear where there are four or fewer people in a home, because the inspectorate's opportunities for dealing with abuses are almost non-existent. I thought that the expression "arm's length" had been accepted by the Government and the Opposition parties, and by people involved in community care. We seek to promote that principle in the amendment and the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) served on the Standing Committee that dealt with the Children Bill in 1989. It will not surprise them that the Government's proposals for arm's length inspectorates would rightly also include children's homes and independent schools. Esther Rantzen's programme did much to draw abuse to our attention, and it showed how powerless local authorities are to deal with situations of which they may be aware.
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
Although there ought to be an arm's length provision we do not want to strip away from local authorities the power that they now have. Their day-to-day knowledge is important for dealing with the matter properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause refers to a general registration council which would monitor nationally and which would also be fair. Apart from the arm's length regional provision, which has much support, minimum national standards are needed, as hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree. Lady Wagner, in her helpful and constructive report, gave examples of best practice and of unacceptable practices, which suggests that there is a strong case for national standards. Unless we have regional boards it will not be possible to gain a national picture, which would enable the House to insist on behalf of the consumer that certain standards be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, progress reports from the regional boards would act as an umbrella. We want to improve the dialogue and exchange of information between regions so that eventually information on best practice influences national standards and standards constantly improve. The regional boards would advise the Government on standards and important matters such as capital and revenue resources. Capital expenditure and revenue implications must be monitored. When people in the private and public sectors involve themselves in capital expenditure without recognising the revenue consequences, standards often fall to the detriment of the client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional authorities would be well placed to promote consistency in the implementation of registration procedures and standards. The debate about registration procedures will continue. People rightly ask about consistency. There is evidence that there is not always consistency even within individual regions. Monitoring would achieve the quality of care that Lady Wagner's report commended for our support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the arm's-length issue the AMA—and this might offer the Committee some guidance on practical application—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This however would be an officer, administrative-led 'arm's length' inspection. The Boards will set the context in which those 'arm's length' Inspectorates for each local authority would operate. Beyond that the 'arm's length' Inspectorate will be based on numbers of homes and registrations, etc."</p></blockquote>
Even the local authorities and local authority associations, such as the AMA, do not say that we should have self-regulation. They do not want to be judge and jury of their own service provision. Of course they want a say in what happens, but they recognise, as did the AMA, the importance of arm's-length inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important point about value for money. When we consider service provision for the elderly we see that there is a wide gap between the best available and that which could not be so described. How can we be sure that the residents of homes for the elderly and those who make finance available, through income tax, the poll tax or whatever, are getting value for money? Local authorities agree with me that service provision should be of the highest standard and proper monitoring should not only cover the provision of service and the needs and rights of the user but take account of the importance of value for money. In many respects, that was the argument of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
Audit Commission and the Griffiths report, which is part of the case for putting the amendment and new clause before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Registration and inspection, the suitability of building staff and managers and the inspection of quality of service are obviously profoundly important. There are examples elsewhere, particularly in Scandinavia, of efficiency and concern being seen as compatible. The local authorities, the boards and national Government aim for efficiency but do not at the same time cut service provision, and there is still concern at local level to maintain the excellence of provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on an important point. Does he agree that the word "inspection" implies that a sanction is available if provision is found to be inadequate and that for the vast majority of residential establishments, an inspection is often seen as an opportunity to catch up with up-to-date ideas and as valuable assistance, not simply as a disciplinary sanction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred earlier to the Children Act 1989 —the hon. Gentleman served on the Standing Committee —and we discussed at some length the Esther Rantzen programme and its demand for inspections in public schools. We accepted at that time the principle that, apart from encouraging people to improve their standards, the inspector should be seen as protecting the rights of the public and of those whom we wish to serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not significant that the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) made that intervention? The social services department of his local authority in Kent was responsible for monitoring homes throughout the Kent area two year ago, and its failure to do so led to a major national network television programme called "The Granny Business", which exposed the repeated failure of the local authority to monitor property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the authority was questioned by me and by journalists on the matter, the director of social services deliberately misled the public and make statements, knowing them to be untrue. He subsequently refused to give statements to the press when pressed in detail on those matters, yet we were all proved right when prosecutions were brought against home owners in the Kent area and it was generally accepted by the Kent media and the Kent public that the state of private homes in Kent was an absolute disgrace. There was a public outrage in all the newspapers in Kent, and the news was carried repeately on television and radio programmes. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent conveniently forgets what happened in the biggest scandal in granny farming anywhere in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be interventions, not speeches. If hon. Members wish to speak in the debate, I shall of course call them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) served to remind the Committee that we are discussing some of the most vulnerable people in society. They deserve to be protected by legislation. The word "inspectorate" is appropriate because there is evidence of abuses. The frail, elderly and vulnerable cannot always
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
speak for themselves. There should be a regional inspectorate to ensure that individual homes maintain the best standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will agree that often the Laura Ashley, chintzy kind of homes look good on the outside. The beauty of an inspectorate is that surprise visits could be made. As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said, there is preparation for the occasional inspection, especially in Gillingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot accept an intervention in an intervention. Hon. Members should let the hon. Member who is speaking utter two words before they intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) said is untrue. She has the town confused and does not know her facts. The town involved was Gravesend, not Gillingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was somewhere in the south.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) made a significant intervention. Every town in Kent was included in the inquiry carried out by Yorkshire Television reporters. It is disturbing that they did not have the resources for a comprehensive examination of all homes. They left anxious about the homes that they had not identified where local social services monitoring arrangements were insufficient. The farming of elderly people in Kent—that is what it is called there—is a disgrace, and it still continues. The increasing numbers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. You must judge whether it is appropriate to have a debate on the issues of a particular county interwoven with a debate on a principle. It is not for me to say, but it would help the Committee if this debate could be conducted as a debate rather as a series of interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention. I stress that interventions should be just that. I shall be more than happy to call any hon. Member who wants to make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am winding up the debate that the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) initiated. The exchanges confirm the need for the amendment. An inspectorate and proper inspections are even more important in view of other provisions in the Bill. Local authorities will have a leading role thrust upon them, which suggests that they should make it easier still for the private sector to develop. There will not be the level playing field that the Opposition want. There is evidence, too, of many closures and bankruptcies. The highest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
standards should be maintained and it should be known that there will be inspections, if necessary without notice. If homes have nothing to hide, that will not matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the television evidence to which my hon. Friend the Member for Workington referred. It highlighted issues that should be subject to public scrutiny. In future, if an Act of this kind is passed we should not deal with inspections on the basis of television investigations. Families of elderly people who take up residence in these homes should be asured that someone is prepared to undertake the responsibilities of the inspectorate. That will not impose dictatorial regimes within social service provision, quite the reverse. We aim to involve everyone concerned in service provision and especially the consumer. Sadly, there is much evidence of abuse, and we know that inspection is inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Lady Wagner's report, and by implication in Sir Roy Griffiths's report, we know that a demand exists for change. We should monitor the system, ensure that it is working and, above all, ensure that elderly, frail and vulnerable people are not exploited. Such exploitation is intolerable.

I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak in the debate. I wanted only to make a helpful intervention. I stressed that the majority of homes welcome inspectors to assure those who run them that their standards are appropriate and that they are up to date with the most recent technical and professional developments. Most reputable home managers in the private or public sector find that the inspector is a source of strength and support rather than some sort of police officer. Nevertheless, it is important for that policing function to be carried out appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will come as no surprise to the Committee to learn that, once again, the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has produced, in the form of an intervention in an otherwise admirable speech, a series of exaggerations and misrepresentations which should not be allowed to pass unchallenged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly suspect that in every county, including Cumbria, there will be practices in residential establishments that range from the disgraceful to the excellent. If a television company, or any other investigative mechanism, were to devote time to that county, undesirable practices would be unearthed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme that so delighted the hon. Member for Workington showed a high proportion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It did not delight me. It might have delighted the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me rephrase that. The programme did not delight the hon. Gentleman but he enjoyed enormously the opportunities it gave him to misrepresent the position in Kent and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the allegations in that television programme were two or three years behind the time. At least one of the most flagrant abuses was already the subject of a criminal investigation. In those circumstances it is easy for a television company to confuse action that has been taken, action that is pending and action that has not been taken but ought to be, and to present a much more deleterious picture than is justified. The people of Kent have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
dismayed by the distorting and skilfully misrepresentative editing of the programme but have welcomed the fact that it drew attention to abuses and provided Kent with an opportunity greatly to strengthen its inspection function and tighten procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the programme gave Kent an opportunity to tighten inspection procedures. We are talking about a form of care that has been developing in Kent for years. Eventually a television company decided to make a programme, and it was in Kent for several months. Is it not significant that, immediately after transmission, the council sat in secret session to make decisions, and that within a matter of days it appointed additional staff to monitor homes and produce reports which admit abuse? Is there not obviously a connection between the programme and the appointment of additional monitoring staff? Is it not fair to say that the negligence of Tory Members from Kent, who failed to identify the abuse, was responsible for a television company having to expose that abuse in its programme, thereby provoking reforms and changes, in the social services department of Kent county council? I blame Kent Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire enormously the unassailable self-confidence of the hon. Member for Workington, who knows beyond peradventure that there is not, nor ever likely to be, abuse of any sort in the area that he represents that is able to be discerned by anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) unfairly pins blame on hon. Members for these so-called happenings. My hon. Friend will perhaps agree that the hon. Gentleman is pinning blame on the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) for the disgraceful incidents at Nye Bevan lodge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is right because no other possible implication can be drawn from the hon. Gentleman's remarks save that in every scandal in every local authority home the Member of Parliament who represents the constituency is to blame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But you were told.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So was the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interjections do not help the debate. I was not told. The word "you" refers to me, not to the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam. We should not heed sedentary interjections. However, as the hon. Member for Workington has an obsessional belief that he knows better than I do what comes to my surgery and what appears in my correspondence, I can only suppose that he suffers from a form of delusion which itself should be investigated. At least twice in Committee he has given categorical assurance that I have had—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps it would assist the Committee if hon. Members did not cast aspersions upon the integrity or sanity of other members of the Committee, bearing in mind that Mr. Speaker is the only individual in the land who has such powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam, and do not wish to cast aspersions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems appropriate that where bad procedures and scandalous activity are discerned in an area of a public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
authority's responsibility, those who run the public authority should take remedial action. Far from seeing that as scandalous reaction, I regard it as wholly appropriate. I am glad that Kent has taken such action. I very much doubt whether Kent, or any other county, will be able to eliminate the abuse that can stem from lax management and the great pressure under which staff work, however much procedures are improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the hon. Gentleman, now that he has returned to the gravamen of his speech, what struck me in watching the programme: one reason for the delay in deregistering some of the homes appeared to be the worry of the Kent social services directorate that it would become responsible for the people in any of the homes that it closed and that the charge would fall on Kent county council. That is not an irrelevant or privileged consideration, given the extent to which the Social Services department's resources for residential care were already stretched. Surely the conflict of interest between its role as the inspectorate and its role as the body that has to provide for the people displaced by the deregistration of homes supports our case in the amendment and new clause—that the inspection should be at arm's length remove from the local authority, thereby ensuring that the conflict of interest is not the determining factor in whether action is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much share the hon. Gentleman's view. As I have said on previous occasions, I am in favour of having an independent inspectorate. Another reason for delay in taking action, in at least two cases, was the expectation that a change in management would enable the home to recover, and that that would be less disruptive for the people living there than closing it and having to find them places elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to have methodical, regular and effective inspection of all residential establishments connected with community care. I say that because I believe that more abuse and poor care stem from the gradual increase of slightly shoddy and careless procedures, passing unnoticed from being careless into being oppressive, than from malicious people behaving badly. Even the best run homes should have an opportunity to learn from inspectors how to upgrade procedures and improve the standard of care. That is why I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to new clause 13 because it takes a commonsense approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has been accused this morning of exaggeration and misrepresentation in his comments about the private sector in Kent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MRS. MAHON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the free market experiment in care, Mrs. Mahon, has caused great suffering among vulnerable and dependent elderly people. That cannot be denied, and it is a direct result of Government policies. The Government were shamed into legislation—the Registered Homes Act 1984 —because of a series of scandals in the private sector. They were forced into taking action because of their own free-market experiment in care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to confront the problems that are known to affect the inspectorate system, and I am surprised that the Government have not proposed something along the lines of new clause 13. We have already heard about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
existing problems, but I want to stress one or two issues. One is the worry that exists about the independence of the present inspectorate system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many areas there is political sensitivity about the inspectorate being administered by local authorities. It is argued that Labour authorities are hard on the private sector for political reasons. I have also heard it said that Tory authorities go easy on the private sector. It is an accusation which may in some instances be true of both Labour and Tory authorities. It is a serious issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area of concern is the lack of consistency in interpreting the law on inspection, including the 1984 Act, among different local authorities, often in the same area. In west Yorkshire, in an authority on one side of the border, the interpretation of the guidance on the number of people permissible in a room in a home is different from that which has been made two miles away in another authority. That is nonsense. There must be consistency so that it will be known how the law will be interpreted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I became a Member of Parliament, as a member of the social services committee in Wakefield I served on a committee which examined the interpretation and application of the 1984 Act in the private sector and in directly provided part III accommodation. We said from the outset that the provisions and requirements in the private sector should apply also to part HI accommodation. I am proud to say that that resulted in a reduction in the number of beds which we had, because we reduced the number of people sleeping in the same room together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited homes in the private sector, and I vividly recall one in my constituency where in one room, which I imagine was previously a sitting room in a large mansion, seven elderly ladies had their beds, including one in the fireplace, under the chimney. Santa Claus would have arrived at Christmas directly into the old lady's bed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that we have effected changes since then, in both the public and private sectors. Consistency is important, and I think that new clause 13 would increase it in the public and private sectors and among neighbouring authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another area of concern, which has already been referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cooke) in an intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe). My hon. Friend described the serious implications for local authorities employing registered homes officers under the current local authority inspection system when officers decide to carry out the ultimate sanction of closing a private home. That is because it is the local authority which then has to accommodate the residents from that home. Therefore, there is an inbuilt disincentive to use sanctions. I am sure that under the current system, registered homes officers sometimes have at the back of their mind a worry about the implications for their authority if they pursue a problem and close a home or impose sanctions against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 13 is common sense because it would take inspections away from the immediate locality. It would be a positive step. It would take them away from the local authority that is directly concerned. One advantage of new clause 13 which needs to be spelled out is that the tendency to base an evaluation of standards in the private and public sector on a very small area would be overcome, because the area to be examined would be spread out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
From my involvement in social services, I know that the standards which are applied differ from one area to another. Some areas have very high standards, so the inspectorate there will demand high standards of the less desirable homes. In other areas, that does not happen. Looking at the examples of good practice could do much good in raising the standards of some of the poorer homes. The inspectorate will have an opportunity to see a much wider range of practice and to apply good standards to homes which do not offer as good quality of care as others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 13 would also make the inspection process more obviously independent than it is now. It would allow for consistency in the application of the law among local authorities in the same area. As I have said, the lack of that consistency is a problem that needs to be overcome. It would also remove the in-built disincentive to use the sanctions in the way that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) may have made the point before I arrived in Committee this morning, but I stress that the amendment stems from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and directly from the concerns felt by local councils. I cannot see why the Government should resist it. It is common sense, and I hope that the Minister will accept it as a means of improving the current situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure whether new clause 13 is the most sensible way forward, but some of the contributions from both sides of the Committee show that there is some sense in what is being recommended. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) summed it up very well. We have only to look at residential and nursing homes around the country to see that standards are a mixture of the disgraceful and the excellent. There do not seem to be national standards, national monitoring or any guidelines at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although new clause 13 is not properly drafted and will probably be over-bureaucratic, I think that my hon. Friend the Minister should listen very carefully to what the people who run private residential nursing homes are actually saying. They want an independent standards authority, national guidelines and national standards, and most important of all, they are prepared to pay for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members make party-political points and say that the problems are in the private residential sector. There are indeed problems there, and every Member of Parliament knows what they are, but we cannot ignore the problems in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that. I do not deny that I have seen some good examples of practice in private homes, but I have also seen some appalling examples. I have seen both good and bad examples in local authority homes. However, perhaps the hon. Gentleman would accept that the difference between the two sectors is that the private sector can pick and choose whom to have as residents, while the local authority has to pick up the tab and accept the people rejected by the private sector as being unsuitable, confused, incontinent and so on. That is the big difference. The private sector has the choice, while the local authority is a dustbin for the private sector in many instances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not necessarily accept that. I do not say that it does not happen, but I do not accept that it is the norm. Certainly, under the new procedures, there will be some parity of resources. We must make absolutely sure
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
that those resources are adequate—that will be debated at another time—but what happened at the Nye Bevan lodge was a national disgrace. An old lady was found there with burnt hands; she had been told to hold on to a hot towel rail. Old people were deliberately helped to die by workers exposing them to the cold, and one resident was found so cold that she was thought to be dead: her window was open and the radiator off, in February or March. Staff teased a woman crippled by arthritis about the smell caused by her ulcerated legs; staff and non-residents drank at a bar located in the downstairs section of the home; drinking on duty was common; and some staff were alcoholics. In 1984, an old man asked to leave the Nye Bevan lodge as it was like, to quote him, a concentration camp.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be well known to my hon. Friend that in several of the reports on scandals in the public sector, one of the elements thought to contribute to the scandals was the very close relationship between the elected members, the trade unions and the staff of the homes. That is the mirror image of the relationship between the people ultimately responsible for running private sector homes and the people who manage them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I shall quote from an article in 	<i>The Independent</i> on 22 July 1987 by Nicholas Timmins, the political correspondent who was then social services correspondent, about what was said by Mrs. Ward, the then deputy leader of Labour-controlled Southwark council, about the Leader of the council, Mr. Ritchie. Mr. Timmins wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To a considerable extent, Mrs. Ward said, Mr. Ritchie owed his position to the manual worker unions, particularly NUPE, who dominated the Peckham Labour party, for which he is a councillor. Labour group meetings were attended by trade union members in an atmosphere of 'insults, booing, shouting and intimidation, in which decisions were taken with senior council managers excluded, and unable to offer their advice or counteract anything that was said'."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that any Opposition Member would agree with that state of affairs. Whatever the political hue of the council, under the existing system from the 1984 legislation, it happened, and those are the people who will have the power of inspection. There may be more public pressure, but, so far as I am aware, there will be no national standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and, to some extent, the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), are arguing for the new clause. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent described the situation at Nye Bevan lodge. Where would the Government be without Nye Bevan lodge? They drag up that one example constantly. There are hundreds of examples of private sector abuse. The events at Nye Bevan lodge highlight the need for the sort of system that is proposed in new clause 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the principle of what the hon. Gentleman says although I take issue with the actuality. I said at the outset that I have sympathy with the need for some form of standard or guidance, although not in the bureaucratic form suggested by the new clause. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister for Health not to rule out entirely some form of national organisation nor shut the door. There should be careful monitoring and an appraisal of how the 1984 legislation works and an examination of the way in which local authorities will cope with these new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
responsibilities and the additional resources that the Government will provide. If necessary, the Government should look at the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who run residential homes, whether public or private, need reassurance about inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most important of all, our constituents need reassurance that their elderly and frail loved ones who enter a residential home of whatever type will be properly cared for and that the necessary resources are available for that care. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems sad that the sensible opening of the debate by the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) has been somewhat soured by accusations and counter-accusations across the Committee. These matters should greatly concern us all because our elderly constituents will be the residents of these homes. Often they will be physically and mentally ill. The residents may include children. We should be seeking an improvement in all such homes whether they are run by the private, the public or the voluntary sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall when I was the chairman of social services having an extremely difficult matter to deal with regarding a group of homes run by MIND. It came within a hair's breadth of being as difficult and embarrassing as the Nye Bevan lodge matter must be to the London borough of Southwark. It has to be said that the Nye Bevan lodge incident is not isolated although it is probably the worst example of a badly-run council home. Those of us who have been involved with social services will have visited good, bad and indifferent local authority homes as we did private sector homes in those categories. The question of whether there should be a national inspection body centres on whether we feel that it would be practicable for officials of such a body to visit homes run by all sectors sufficiently frequently to ensure that standards are maintained. It would be all too easy for a team from outside the borough to visit, perhaps on spec but more often by appointment, and find everything rosy. If the local principal purchaser —which will be the local authority—is made responsible, at arm's length from its own social services department, for inspection of the homes, it is much more likely that it will take place more frequently, more thoroughly and without appointment. We will do well to remember that in considering the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that out aim should be to improve standards in both public and private sectors. I accept that there is a need for improvement in the public sector also. Remembering Nye Bevan lodge and other public sector homes in which standards are not all that they should be, can he say how the Bill will help? It provides for clear financial discrimination against local authorities directly providing part III accommodation, and makes private sector funding arrangements that are completely different from those for the public sector, thus making it impossible for local authorities to continue to provide their own direct part III accommodation. How will that improve public sector standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall discuss funding on later clauses, which is perhaps the right time to discuss the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my position to have to answer questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already stressed that I do not like sedentary interventions. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, if he had attempted to answer that question, I would have called him to order because it does not arise on this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am always grateful for the protection of the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter that worries me somewhat is that I am holding briefs on the clauses from the Association of Directors of Social Services who perhaps have more interest than anyone in clause 37 and others relating to community care, as it will fall to them as a statutory duty in their capacity as directors of social services, to monitor, control and regulate homes in their areas. Their amendments go into detail about the Registered Homes Act 1984 but they say little about monitoring homes under their control. I am worried, because they should have dealt with the problem of monitoring private, public and voluntary sector homes. We all want an improvement in the standards of the worst to those of the best. That is no mean aim, because there is wide variation between the worst and the best. We have heard examples today of the best and the worst from both public and private sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked my researcher to go to my office for my casework file on abuse of the elderly in private care in Kent. It is a file of sworn affidavits and statements from people in the nursing profession and of correspondence with Kent county council, all following the excellent Yorkshire Television report that drew attention to the scale of the abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me about today's proceedings is that Conservative Members—who in their personal lives are, I am sure, as compassionate as any of us—put aside personal views on personal relationships and somehow treat with some indifference the elderly people in private health care in various parts of the country. Kent Members were informed about the Kent scandal. My correspondence contains complaints going back as far as 1981 about homes on which no action was taken until two years ago. I accept that the position is probably the same elsewhere in the country, but in many of our constituencies we make a vigorous effort to ensure that abuse is stamped out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency I take a particular interest in what goes on in these homes; I am involved in carrying out inquiries into what is happening in one of them. We cannot afford to allow these matters to rest. We cannot take a macro-global view and presume that, because the legislation has been framed and local authorities appear to accept their responsibilities, they necessarily do. Very often, they do not. That is what the Kent scandal shows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Gentlemen of the early-day motion that I tabled after my visit to Kent, which led to a television confrontation on TVS between the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and myself in which we specifically dealt with the early-day motion and the arrangements for home helps in Kent. That provision had been cut and the local authority was insisting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Is the question of the home help service in Kent relevant to the amendments? I doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall determine what is in order. If the hon. Gentleman referred to the matter in passing, that is all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention should tell the public who are watching our proceedings what a sensitive issue this is in the minds of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to displace people from institutionalised care in NHS hospitals led to a massive flow of people from the public to the private sector. A few years later there was a substantial increase in the number of people in Kent who were receiving private care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My researcher has dug out the figures from the notes that I made some years ago. In 1975 there were 200 homes; in 1987 there were 513, which means that 8,800 places in private homes were provided for the elderly in Kent during that programme. The programme did not have the resources to go out and examine what was happening in all those homes. Individual homes were selected on the basis of correspondence provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman), whose sister, Sarah Harman, was also a source of information. Many people provided information from representations that they had received, including some from Labour councillors in Kent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from resolutions, and amendments to those resolutions, tabled by councillors in Kent that for many years they repeatedly demanded additional resources for the inspectorate responsible for monitoring these homes. Their resolutions were always defeated, which showed how unwilling Kent county council was to do anything about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the revenue support grant figures for the Kent county council here. They are not often referred to by Conservative Members on the Floor of the House. They show that the Government greatly reduced the revenue support grant settlement for Kent, which put extensive pressure on the local authority. Political arguments about whether Labour would raise the rates more than the Tories —in the end that is the basic consideration—made it impossible for the money to be made available. The Government refused to give vital increases at a time when the number of people coming from the public sector to the private sector of care was vastly expanding. That resulted in indescribable abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I tabled my motion I discussed it with a Conservative councillor in Kent, who rang me to say that what I had uncovered was an embarrassment to Conservatives throughout Kent and that everything possible was being done to ensure that action would be taken—but that that would be done behind closed doors, to avoid public embarrassment. That Conservative councillor than thanked me for doing in Parliament what he thought Conservative Members in Kent should have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall read the early-day motion to the hon. Member for Mid-Kent because it relates to the failure of the inspectorate:
	<br><blockquote><p>This House notes the visit by the Secretary of State for Social Services to Kent and in particular to the 'Carnalea' (Faversham) a private residential home for the elderly which was recently the subject of serious allegations of neglect and abuse of incontinent and mentally confused elderly people; notes that this home has now changed hands; asks why Mr. Moore is not visiting other homes in the area subject to similar allegations including 'Annersley House' (Margate) the subject of over fifty allegations of abuse including the tying of elderly men and women to chairs as a punishment for

incontinence, theft, interference with residents' mail, forced administration of sedatives, deliberate overcrowding to maximise profits and criminal assault; the 'Norfolk Hotel' (Westgate-on-Sea) deliberate overcrowding, poor hygiene, forced and inappropriate mixing of the elderly with people suffering from psychiatric illnesses, neglect of bedridden residents for long periods; 'The Elms' (Herne Bay) and 'The Anglia', overcrowding, assault, theft; notes Mr. Moore's attempts to instil confidence in private provision for the elderly in Kent whilst failing to take action on grossly inadequate standards in large sections of the private sector in Kent and nationally; believes that the Minister should go to Kent when all the problems have been dealt with not at a time when Kent County Council are only now being forced by public outcry to take corrective action; calls on the Government and Kent to reverse their policy of supporting further private residential homes for the aged and infirm.</p></blockquote>
I understand that throughout that period private care was —it still is—expanding in Kent. When I asked social workers in Kent why this abuse had not been exposed earlier they told me straight that the resources were not available and that the inspectorate was not large enough to cope. They simply did not have the funds and resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will lead to a vast expansion of private care and because of cash restraints, we know that resources will not be made available to provide an adequate inspectorate. I am sure that Conservative Members will say that those resources will be provided because the Bill says that they must. However, legislation has always said that and been framed to give local authorities responsibility for monitoring. There has always been an assumption that resources will be given to fund the level of monitoring that Labour Members seek but, in truth, those funds have never been provided, and they never will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is why Opposition Members have placed emphasis on care provision in the public sector. We know that there have been abuses in the public sector and Conservative Members have rightly drawn attention to a particular abuse in the London area. However, there is greater abuse overall in the private sector, because the motive there is different. In the public sector, unnatural relationships have been forged which act against the public interest, and that may lead to covering up incidents of abuse. We all agree that that is wrong and should be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the private sector there is the larger consideration of profit. A pound not spent is a pound saved. That is why we must ensure that there is an adequate inspectorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say that, but I have a file that includes sworn affidavits from a number of homes in the Kent area, any hon. Member may see it if he wishes. It is a litany of complaint and abuse, much of which cannot be dealt with within the resources currently available to local authorities. Labour Members do not have a monopoly on compassion, but hon. Gentlemen must understand that those who frame legislation cannot divorce themselves from its impact.

My final remarks may please hon. Members who represent Kent constituencies. There is some good provision in Kent. I visited a home called Nelson Court, in Chatham, which is a fine example of what public and private provision should be about. I am sure that there are more such examples in Kent, and that people on the county council have fought for such provision. The problem is that there are still 8,500 people, perhaps more, in homes in the private sector that are not properly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
monitored or inspected. The amendments seek to ensure that those homes will be inspected by an independent inspectorate that is separately funded and cannot be subjected to cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This should not be treated as a Cinderella provision that is made only if the money is available. We want a solid, institutionalised inspectorate responsible for ensuring that standards are met. If it were provided, I would not take exception to the expansion of private provision. I have no ideological hang-ups about private provision—I accept that it can work and that there are good private homes. The problem is that there are many bad ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an inspectorate is properly constructed, private provision will work; if it is not, it will fail and we will pay the price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituency lies somewhere between Workington and Kent but I shall not follow the remarks of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend consider that the constituents of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) may be disappointed that he spent all his time talking about Kent? They may wonder why they should suffer just because there is no Labour MP to speak for the residents of Kent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but as we are in Committee, he may merely tempt the hon. Member for Workington to make another speech about his constituents. I hope, in the interests of time, that we can avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The elderly are frail and vulnerable; that has not changed. What has changed is that there are more of them and we must consider seriously any provision that we make for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the debate. I became a member of the Committee partly to learn more about the subject and to reinforce experience gained in my constituency where there are many residential care homes and some nursing homes. I was interested in the drive towards quality and standards and how they could best be delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am an agnostic about what might be done. I am aware of the existing system; I can understand the theoretical arguments about not keeping it within the broad remit of the county council which, albeit at arm's length, provides homes. Any member of the same organisation is bound to take into account budgets and personal relationships within the organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, for example, I received a letter on county council letterhead from my residential care home inspector inviting me to participate in a conference on these issues. It came in the same post as a letter from another arm of the county council so it came, in a sense, from the same structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), I shall want assurances from the Minister on how the inspection system will work and on the involvement of the social services inspectorate. We will want to know about independent inspection units and how the highest possible standards will be ensured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point bears slightly on control or regulation by a local authority. It is not merely a matter of physical standards in homes. I do not know the answer, in terms of institutions, but local authorities are bound to consider the nuts and bolts of the measures. Inevitably, because they
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
are measurable, they look at staffing ratios, width of doors, provision of lavatories and so on. That is proper, but when older property is being adapted it is sometimes onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my county, the social services department is usually extremely helpful but there has been friction about a new handbook of standards between the department and some of the more responsible representatives of care homes. I worked hard to smooth out the problem and my latest intelligence is that peace is breaking out all over. Some of the more thoughtful private operators said that they are concerned not merely with whether this or that passage is a certain size or whether the fire standards are just so, although such aspects are important. They are worried, too, about the nature and quality of care—not nursing care, but caring care. That is important, and I hope that we shall become more involved in the subject in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My wife and I visit many local authority and private homes in my constituency. We can easily tell the difference between a good home and a bad one. My wife, who visits homes more regularly than I do, has a keen eye for such things. The difference cannot easily be defined, or written on a piece of paper as a standard to be included in legislation. It is a matter of the attitude of those who operate the homes. I hope that the spirit of what the good homes have achieved can be carried through by the local authority inspectorate and reinforced from the centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree on the need to raise the standards of care in local authority and private homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twice a year, Members of Parliament in my locality can visit as many local authority homes as they choose by arrangement with the social services department. I shall speak about the private homes when we discuss new clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not prepared to accept new clause 13, how will he raise standards? Members on both sides of the Committee have spoken about the need to raise standards and ensure that they are maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elderly people are becoming more vulnerable because there are more of them. We can talk for ever and ever about what we want to achieve, but unless Governments are prepared to back it up with money, it is all hot air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My local authority inspects its homes as regularly as clockwork. The local councils can visit them at any time between inspections to make sure that all is well. I am very happy with the local authority homes in my area, and I know that I, along with local councillors, can visit them at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But one thing worries me. We are loading local authorities with extra work at the same time as reducing their expenditure, and the Bill does nothing to help them carry out their extra duties. It is well known that the Government have reduced grants to local authorities from two-thirds to one third, and that education and social services account for the most expenditure, so any cuts in local authority expenditure will be made in those areas. There is no point in talking about improving standards unless we are prepared to put the money where the mouth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept new clause 13, what will they put in its place? All who have spoken this morning have said that it is vital to have an increase in care and the standard of care. If the Government put nothing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
in its place, it is clear that they do not intend to do anything, and that means that they are accepting disgraceful standards in some homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is common ground in the Committee that there is a variation in quality of care and the environment in which that care is carried out, in both the private and public sectors. There are examples of both good and poor public sector homes, and the same is true of the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that my hon. Friend the Minister recently saw something of what is being done in homes run by my local authority in the London borough of Bromley, and if she had been able to stay longer, I could have taken her to see some extremely good examples, especially in the voluntary sector. The Bill sets up an inspection system, but as I understand that the Registered Homes Act 1984 is to remain in force, we shall have two systems. What justification is there for that? Would it not be simpler to have a uniform system of registration and inspection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I query whether any homes should be exempt from the system. I know that it would be administratively difficult to register homes with fewer than four beds, but we all know how the regulation is abused, with houses being split into two, and so on. Is it right that homes set up under royal charter should be exempt from the law? Surely registration and inspection should cover all homes, irrespective of whether the people in them are paid for by the local authority or by themselves. I understand that if all the residents in a home pay for themselves, that home will not necessarily be covered by the inspection procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely we need a uniform system for all homes, and here we have an opportunity to set one up. I am not worried about whether the system is national, regional or local. What matters is that it should be independent, have common standards, and command confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ian Grist)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting start to the debate on part III. The subject is one that interests many members of the Committee, and I hope that once we have got some of the steam out of the debate—perhaps today —our deliberations can proceed on as non-partisan a basis as possible. This is not a political battlefield; it is one in which we are all concerned to see that our fellow citizens, especially our elder citizens, are properly and fairly treated. Most of us have visited and know homes in our constituencies, whether they are private, voluntary or provided by the local authority, and many of us have had dealings with them as relatives of parents and others. So this is not an area in which we seek other than to do the best that we can within what we can contribute as a public body.

I could say that the new clause is defective, but I shall not pursue that argument. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) put the case in his usual friendly and constructive way, and I am sure that we shall hear a great deal more of the argument. The hon. Gentleman accepted regional variations, but he wanted national standards—something that is probably not too far from what all of us want. He was perhaps mistaken in quoting Wagner and Griffiths in support of his arguments, because neither was in favour of a national system. It is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
subject that has reared its head before and I have no doubt that it will do so again. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said—he seems to have disappeared for the moment—the subject is not set in concrete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has profoundly misunderstood the new clause. It does not suggest a national system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be the effect of the extra tier —a bureaucratic tier, if I may say so—which we believe is unnecessary. We would accept the regional variations that the hon. Member for Monklands, West welcomed. They set different standards, and people can see whether the system in a different authority is better. With uniformity, there is a risk that more far-seeing or thoughtful developments may go by the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it possibly be that the Griffiths report did not recommend that because it would cost money? Griffiths had a zero cost remit, and was looking to provide services, inspectorates, and so on, within the existing financial budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken if he does not think that our proposals will cost some money, but I cannot predict how much. Our intention is to provide the framework for a good, workable, humane system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to have registration and inspection units in the local authorities, under the control of the director of social services, and quite separate from the running of local authority homes. The director of the unit would be advised by an advisory committee made up of representatives from various other sectors—the voluntary sector, the private sector, and so on. The unit's actions would be moderated by the knowledge and experience of the members of the advisory committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that although at present there are no formal arrangements, there are informal arrangements of a similar nature? Social services directors already consult those to whom the Minister referred, yet despite representations from those bodies and despite the consultations that take place, local authorities do not have the resources to fund the inspectorates properly. They will be no further forward. They always return to the argument about whether to spend or not to spend on roads or inspectorates, and invariably they come down on what has the most high profile in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a responsibility that local authorities will have to assume, and quite rightly. I am slightly bewildered, as I was on Second Reading, at being attacked for accepting the Griffiths recommendation to put the weight of responsibility on local authorities, when generally we are accused of attacking local authorities and not trusting them. All the fear of local authorities seems to be coming from the Opposition Benches, which I find slightly odd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all right to put the responsibility on local authorities if they are given enough money to cope with it. My local authority is worried about the size of the homes that are being proposed. They will be institutions, not homes. There are applications for institutions with 120 beds or spaces. Will it be acceptable for local authorities to bring in regulations to limit the size of homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be for the local authority to decide on the quality of provision for people in its area, moderated

by ministerial advice such as the "At Home" circular to which the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) referred. Certainly we look for homely homes. As the contracting authority, the local authority will have enormous power, which it has lacked until now, over the provision of quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe strongly that one of the most valuable features of the education system is the free-standing national inspectorate which, from time to time, produces reports about the state of education. Will the social services inspectorate have that role?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend anticipates me. I was coming to that. The responsibility will be placed on the local authority, which will be inspected by the social service inspectorate. The ultimate court of appeal, at long stop, will be the Secretary of State—that is covered in clause 44. That must be so. The amendment would give AMA and others an excuse to shuffle off some of their responsibility, and I do not know why they should not want it. After all, they have sought responsibility. They cannot escape it, and nor can we in this place. Local authorities are the right area for this provision, and taking some of the responsibility away from them would be unwise. It would remove flexibility. I urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I hope that Conservative Members will not object if I say that it has occasionally reminded me of my first foray into local government. I remember knocking at a friendly old lady's door, and after a nice conversation she said, "We know you son. We know your mother, but we will not be voting for you in this household because we are non-political. We vote Conservative." I have the feeling that the charm that others seem to detect has not persuaded people that the case is better and more appealing than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our case is unanswerable, and I regret that the Minister did not agree with our proposition. Local authorities, especially the AMA, have answered his charge. The AMA said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In summary, the overriding rationale for such a body as a Regional Inspectorate unit would be to ensure absolute detachment from each local authority for the registration and inspection functions of units."</p></blockquote>
It recognised the need for detachment. It did not say, "Leave it to us as local authorities to be involved in self-regulation." There are two good reasons for that, which were embraced by the Griffiths report. First, as the report said in criticism, responsibility cannot be given to local authorities or anyone else if the responsibilities are not matched by resources. Secondly the AMA said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Other advantages of this kind of body would be the consistency of standards across the region which could contribute to the raising of standards in some areas."</p></blockquote>
That is what it is all about: not just about good standards, but about improving upon the good standards that already exist. I thought that the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) made a canny point. Although it was not echoed by any of his hon. Friends, it deserves repetition. He said that some residential owners have been calling for such an inspectorate. They have been, and he was right to say it in the measured way that he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may have overlooked the fact that the new registration and inspection units will apply a standard of consistency to all homes, whether they
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
are private, voluntary or their own. Private proprietors want consistency, so that they are not judged differently from state or voluntary provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister takes that view, I do not understand why he is not supporting the amendment and the new clause. As my hon. Friends have said, it is a matter of resources. We shall not achieve our objectives if the Government do not accept that they have responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are worried, especially as the poll tax approaches, that they will be given more responsibilities but then be either rate-capped or blamed for carrying out those responsibilities. We have experience of that in Scotland. That is why there is so much regional variation, and why we do not have national standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Griffiths report suggested clearly that national standards ought to be our objective. Lady Wagner, it seemed to me, paved the way. If we had the inspectorate, some of the abuses that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have mentioned might not have taken place. No Committee member would condone what took place at Nye Bevan lodge. The inquiry that followed which then led to Jennie Lee house, should not have tried to sweep under the carpet a problem that was intolerable. If we had had regional standards and monitoring based on a national approach, the abuse would not have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without an inspectorate that works, is seen to work, and is independent of those providing the service, we cannot be sure that there will not be a repetition in either the private or the public sectors of the dreadful story that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) told about Kent, or of the Nye Bevan lodge story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be reassured if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary were to include in the guidance that the Bill might require a formula for the scale of the units that he is establishing, relative to the number of places available in a local authority area? It would not be impossible to devise such a formula, and it would reduce the anxieties which many of us share about the resources available for inspections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would not be impossible; there is no reason why it should not be considered. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent may have made a slip of the tongue when he talked about my proposals, unless he intends to vote with the Opposition. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a slightly odd three-way intervention, and speak to my hon. Friend through the hon. Member. Local authorities and new units will staff themselves according to outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no restriction on speaking more than once in the Committee so there is no need to make lengthy interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Under-Secretary heed the important intervention of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent? While not placing responsibilities on to local authorities in the way that we would like, he is at least
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
trying to establish a guiding formula. Why should the Under-Secretary object to that? It is not beyond the wit of the Department of Health to produce such a formula based on its wide experience and its consultations with local authorities. Will my hon. Friend encourage the Minister to respond to that suggestion. Perhaps we shall not receive a clear undertaking today, but the Under-Secretary might be prepared to consider the recommendation made by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent and comment upon it. We could table an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always my hon. Friend has made a telling point. He is right; if we fail to persuade the Committee today we shall want to debate the subject again on Report. As we appear to have almost reached agreement on the principle, the Under-Secretary and his ministerial colleagues should carefully consider the suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the mix of public and private sector provision it is not enough simply to make services available, given demographic changes—the number of people happily living longer—without adequate instruction. On Christmas day I visited both private and public sector homes for the elderly in my constituency, which I am sure is typical of many others. Homes run by Strathclyde regional council, by the Salvation Army, and by the private sector were all of the highest standard. None of those organisations would object to inspections, especially as they might show ways of improving even their excellent services. That is the aim of our proposals. The excellence of our debate might lead Conservative Members to support our proposals, whatever Whipping arrangements are made, for those proposals are logical, reasonable, workable and acceptable. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is beguiling, and I fancy that we shall have more of that. The relevant Departments are putting out to consultation to local authorities the functions of and systems for the inspection units. They will be in place by 1 April 1991, but we shall go out to consultation to establish the nuts and bolts of the arrangement. I doubt whether it will end up as a formula. It will probably be designed to help people achieve what is necessary, rather than being, for instance, a mechanistic system of starting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Department of Health has recently put such a document out to consultation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely worried about the formula. The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is common ground on this issue between the Opposition and the Government. Patients in private registered care homes and nursing homes are, by definition, vulnerable and dependent. They would not be in the homes if they were capable of living independently. The amendments would tighten the registration procedure, which was introduced by the Government in the Registered Homes Act 1984. The Government will agree that such patients are entitled to the highest quality care. To ensure that that is provided, the homes must be run by people of the highest integrity. I am sure that the Opposition and the Government agree that people are unsuitable to take on the responsibilities of running homes if they have serious criminal convictions. An immediate problem is that dishonest applicants do not always declare their criminal convictions when they apply for registration. The council then registers them in good faith as proprietors of homes, putting them in charge of dependent, vulnerable people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
We know something about the scale of the problem, but we cannot know about every case because councils discover only by chance when things have started to go seriously wrong through the complaints of residents, relatives, local GPs or health visitors. Then when a council investigates, it discovers that the person running the home has a string of convictions. If the council had known, it would never have registered the person to be a proprietor of a home in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give one example from a number of cases where councils have found after elderly people have suffered that the people running the homes had a string of convictions. I quote from a publication called "No Place Like Home", of which I am the co-author with my sister, Sarah Harman, who is a solicitor. I should like to thank the National and Local Government Officers Association, which published the report. It is about the only report on the decisions of the registered homes tribunal. It is the second such report which I have written, and I should be happy if I did not need to carry on writing them, NALGO did not have to keep publishing them, and the Government took over responsibility for publishing and circulating widely the very important decisions of the registered homes tribunal. In the absence of other publications I shall quote from my own book on the decisions. There is no dispute that they are the decisions which the registered homes tribunal reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case concerns a Mr. Stanley in the borough of Bury. The council registered Mr. Stanley to run a home and subsequently discovered that he had been convicted of criminal offences at Liverpool Crown court. He had three sentences of nine months' imprisonment, some of which were suspended, and during the period of suspension he committed seven further offences of dishonesty, was given five further prison sentences and was fined. The council became aware of it only by chance, because it did not have the opportunity to check the criminal records before he registered as the proprietor of a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the case of Mrs. Gale in Devon, who was the joint owner of a home with her husband. Mr. Gale had—I quote from the tribunal's report—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a long and unhappy period of convictions for offences of dishonesty, the last of which…resulted in a sentence of 2 years imprisonment".</p></blockquote>
They were caring for ex-psychiatric hospital patients. Five of the eight residents attended local day centres and all were on medication to stabilise their condition. These are vulnerable and dependent people who ought to be cared for by people of the highest integrity, not by people with a string of convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the case of Miss McMillan in Lancashire, who with Mrs. Hall applied for the registration of Beechmount house. It came to the notice of the council by chance that Mrs. Hall had been convicted for several offences of forgery and deception, all connected with elderly people, and that she had received a three-year prison sentence for it. She then came out of prison and set up a registered home looking after elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case is that of Mrs. Azzopardi in the London borough of Havering. She had been prosecuted and convicted and had an 18 months' prison sentence. I stress that all these are cases where the councils found out only by chance. Although in some of them no doubt elderly people would have suffered, at least the councils subsequently found the owners out. The problem lies with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
the cases where the council do not know. The offences may have been committed in a different part of the country. Councils do not know that the people whom they register to run homes and care for vulnerable and dependent people can be downright unsuitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 329 would protect vulnerable people but it would not trample on the civil liberties of those who apply to run registered homes. It lists the offences in the statute which makes a person unsuitable for such work. We are not talking about every offence, such as minor driving offences. It is a schedule of serious offences which anybody would agree would make a person unsuitable to be in the responsible position of running a registered care home. It lists murder, manslaughter, infanticide, gross indecency, incest, fraud, theft, blackmail, impersonation and any other offence set out in the Registered Homes Act 1984. I am sure that the Minister would agree that anybody found guilty of committing any of those offences would be unsuitable for registration. The amendment would prevent a person from registering under the Act if they were guilty of one of those offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with the fact that councils do not know whether applicants for negotiation have committed offences, the amendment would make it a statutory obligation on the police to disclose on request to the registration authority any of the scheduled offences committed by an applicant. The local registration authority would give the applicant's name to the police and ask the police to check to see whether he or she had committed any of the scheduled offences. It would not be as if criminal convictions records were floating around the council. They would remain in the hands of the police, who would check them and be able to say to the council, perhaps, "Yes, unfortunately there is a scheduled offence listed against this person."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further safeguard in the amendment, in that the applicant would be able to check the police's response, because the wrong name can sometimes be matched against the wrong criminal record. It is to safeguard applicants and prevent them from being blighted by an inaccurate criminal conviction that the amendment provides that they should have an opportunity to check the record for accuracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady include in the offences which have to be notified those for which convictions were said to be spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are asking the Government to take on board the same protections which exist for people who care for children. We recognise that carers of children have to have particularly high levels of responsibility and integrity because of the vulnerability of children, and the schedule in the amendment is the same as that for those people. The amendment would give to elderly people exactly the same protection as is already given by statute to children, in terms of checking the people who work with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following my representations to the Secretary of State, the hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), then the Minister responsible for social services, the Government introduced the sort of system that is proposed in the amendment for people working with children, and I said at the time that it ought to apply to elderly people as well. The Bill now presents the opportunity to extend the protection which everybody
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
recognises was right to extend to children to elderly people as well. It must be extended to all those who have responsibility for people in residential care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady have any information about how long the police take to check records? I am a trustee of Community Service Volunteers, and we have had considerable difficulty with many police authorities because they have sometimes taken so long to check whether a volunteer had a criminal record that by the time they had checked, the term for which the person had volunteered was virtually spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that there is a problem, but it is a slightly separate situation. We are here talking about people who wish to set up businesses, so it is not so short-term. There are two elements: the time which the police take to check the record and the cost in police time of the additional responsibility. I think that the registration fee is too low anyway and does not cover the cost to DHAs of inspecting homes in their area and running the registration system. The registration fee should be increased, and one way in which it could be spent is by giving the police a fee to cover the cost of their extra time in checking police records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not perfect, no doubt, since I drafted it myself. If the Minister has any query about the wording, I should be more than happy for it to be withdrawn and brought back on Report, or even if the Minister undertook to deal with it at some stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 476 and 477 deal with small homes. We welcomed the Registered Homes Act 1984 as an attempt to protect people in registered care homes from abuse or neglect. It has become clear, however, that there is a major loophole in the Act that leaves thousands of elderly, vulnerable and dependent people without protection. They are the people in homes with fewer than four people. I ask the Minister to concentrate on the individuals whom we are trying to protect, not on the size of the home. In the case of a former psychiatric patient, an elderly or disabled person or someone with a mental disability, question is their need for the protection of the law against exploitation and abuse, not the size of the home. The cut-off point of four residents has led to a determined evasion of the 1984 Act by home owners who, keep to three residents or fewer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many examples in "No Place Like Home" of scandalous homes which have been closed by the tribunal, but which do not really close. The owners just reduce the number of residents, so that the terrible things that have happened to, say, six people, can still happen to the three people who are left. The safeguards of the Act cannot be working properly if the part of the registration procedure that deals with closing homes, even in an emergency where life is at risk, still leaves three people in homes who are not protected by the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite her vexatious opening remarks, the hon. Lady is doing the Committee a service in raising this matter, and I hope to speak on it later. Is she aware that Department of Social Security officials are supposed to ascertain that at least two people work full time in such homes before paying income support, and that in practice that check rarely occurs? Many social security officers claim that they cannot even identify such homes. Does that not reinforce her argument? I hope that Ministers will respond to that worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That is a valid point. Of course the problem relates not only to people on income support but to people being paid for by their relatives. Clearly the councils that place people in homes have a responsibility. Hospitals that discharge patients into homes have a responsibility. The Government, through the payment of income support, have a responsibility. Financial measures alone will not resolve the problem. So-called self-payers are also entitled to protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Association of Directors of Social Services for its excellent briefing in support of these amendments, which I commend to the Minister and other hon. Members. It says that abuses by owners reducing the number of residents in homes to avoid registration have been reported widely to social services directors. It refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Registered homes which lose their registration because of poor standards or a criminal conviction and then set up as a small home with 3 residents",</p></blockquote>
and to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"proprietors who evade registration by establishing a string of small homes each catering for 3 residents or less"</p></blockquote>.
There have been cases where proprietors have bought homes next door to each other, all of which house fewer than four residents. Therefore, they are running a business looking after 20 people but evading the registration procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my hon. Friend raised that issue. The social services director in my constituency has asked me to tell the Committee that by evading inspection, owners are not meeting fire safety and care requirements. She suspects that some are doing so in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harmon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for raising that because the Registered Homes Act 1984 is important. That is why it matters so much that there is a loophole. There will be nothing to stop someone setting up a small home on the day after he leaves prison. In small homes there will be no protection against the dispersing of unsuitable drugs and no fire safety regulations—in fact there will be no standards at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loophole should be closed, and I am glad that the amendment has the support of NALGO, which organises and represents the registration officers in both DHAs and social services departments. The directors of social services departments, who would be responsible for inspecting small homes, have not said, "They are too small, it would be too difficult to inspect them and we do not want that responsibility." They have said that they cannot do their job properly because the owner of a home that they close can avoid the Act by setting up a smaller home. Age Concern also would like the loophole to be closed. Even the association that registers home owners, and which is made up of the proprietors of private homes, claims that if unscrupulous people can avoid registration, the quality of care that it would like home owners to give will be undermined. It feels that it will not be able to achieve that standard of care if rogue home owners can avoid the law by setting up small homes. The Royal College of Nursing is worried about it, and supports the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the amendment may not be perfect, but I hope that the Government will take the valuable opportunity that is provided by the Bill to close the loophole. I hope that the Government will not say that the problem will be dealt with indirectly by a provision
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
elsewhere in the Bill. If they do, they are admitting that the registration procedure has become redundant and irrelevant through changes in the Bill or planned changes in the White Paper. If the Registered Homes Act 1984 is still to be important in protecting the residents of homes, the loophole must be closed and the smaller homes included in the Act. I hope that the Minister will not say that the matter is unimportant because the problem will be eased out by a different provision in the Bill. I hope for a favourable response on a non-party political basis, from both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the general thrust of the argument of the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) and look forward with interest to the reply of my hon. Friend the Minister. The hon. Lady did not mention the National Care Homes Association, a private sector body, though it was good to hear a member of the Labour party supporting a private sector body for once. Several days ago I visited one of the homes in my constituency that is run by the association and had a meeting with the national director and the county chairman of the association. The hon. Lady mentioned most of the issues that they raised. It is a tribute to the Committee's progress that representations from organisations and from hon. Members' constituencies can barely keep pace with us. This morning I received a letter from the director of social services of the Conservative-controlled Somerset county council, which repeats the points raised by the hon. Lady about
	<br><blockquote><p>"proprietors seeking to group clusters of homes each with three places in order to avoid registration of the larger unit."</p></blockquote>
I do not want my hon. Friends to think that such things happen only in Labour-controlled urban areas. They can happen also in leafy shire counties run by Conservatives. The point raised by the hon. Lady about criminal convictions is also made in the letter. She may be interested to know that about a year ago I pursued the case of one of my constituents who was an ambulance driver, which shows that some Conservative Members support some ambulance men. Murky investigations carried out by the driver's colleagues with grudges against him discovered that he had not declared a conviction for receiving stolen goods. Although the conviction had expired, the result of disciplinary procedures was to downgrade him, and he lost all prospects of promotion. I felt that that was a heavy penalty for an ambulance driver. I did my best to help him, but was unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rigorous searches of records should be made to prevent those who want to take on the immense responsibility of running homes for the elderly using false declarations to do so if they have committed the serious crimes listed in the amendment. The amendment may be technically flawed, or the Government might have other ways of dealing with the problem, but I shall listen carefully to the reply of my hon. Friend the Minister on the criminal record and smaller homes issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 329, as I am aware of the exemptions of the rehabilitation of offender legislation. The work that I did before I entered Parliament was covered by those exemptions. I had to declare any previous convictions as my job brought me into contact with vulnerable adults and children. It is right that such checks are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) talked of consistency of legislation. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
nonsensical that there are such requirements for those who care for children but not for those who care for equally vulnerable handicapped or elderly people. There is the element of physical caring and the added factor that in many homes the finances and property of dependent elderly people are handled by those running the homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has looked at the Wagner recommendations and I am sure that she shares my anxiety that it is not desirable for staff members, proprietors, or managers to handle residents' finances, as they now do. We should ensure that the people who do are checked for past convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer specifically to the problems faced by local authorities which have refused to register individuals on the basis of convictions. I tabled a parliamentary question about a Conservative-controlled authority which decided not to register an individual on the basis of a conviction. That decision was overturned by a registered homes tribunal. The case was Love 	<i>v.</i> Wiltshire county council, which was heard on 8–10 August 1988. It was about the registration of the Westgate residential home in Swindon. The local authority stated that Mrs. Love
	<br><blockquote><p>"is no longer a fit person to be concerned in carrying on a residential care home as she has been convicted of offences which would have entitled the Registration Authority to refuse an application for her registration in respect of it."</p></blockquote>
Mrs. Love had been the matron of the Sarnhill nursing home in Swindon, where she was alleged to have committed 10 thefts. On 30 November 1987 she was convicted of five thefts of money totalling £318.32, which took place in April, May and July 1985. The most serious charge was the alleged theft of goods valued at nearly £1,000 between 1 December 1981 and 31 August 1985. Wiltshire county council rightly stated that the people that she would have dealt with were potentially vulnerable. The amazing decision reached by the tribunal was that the council was wrong to cancel the registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a question to the then Under-Secretary of State, which read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Health if, in the light of the recent registered homes tribunal decision in respect of Wiltshire county council's deregistration of the Westgate private aged persons' home in Swindon, he will as a matter of urgency issue guidance to local authorities as to whether, under the provisions of the Registered Homes Act, they should continue to regard proprietors with convictions for theft as unsuitable for registration purposes."</p></blockquote>
To my astonishment, the Minister, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie), replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This tribunal decision demonstrates the need for authorities to take into account all the circumstances of a home and of the person registered in relation to it including any convictions in deciding on the suitability of a person for registration. We do not think that it would be useful to issue general guidance specifically on the subject of convictions for theft."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 November 1988; Vol. 140, c. 	<i>287.</i>]</p></blockquote>
I have studied the judgment and I am still at a loss to know what the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South was talking about when she was on about the full circumstances. I read the full circumstances and believe that the county council was right to take the action that it did. From my knowledge of Mrs. Love, she was unsuitable to handle the
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
finances of vulnerable elderly people. That is an example of where we need to establish consistency and to take action along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham in amendment No. 329 to protect the people who will be resident in homes such as the Westgate in Swindon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall welcome the Minister's response to this case because I am at a loss to understand the logic of the tribunal decision and the logic of the answer that I received from the former Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two points. First, inspection is also an opportunity for people to improve their practice. Therefore many small home proprietors will welcome the opportunity to learn better ways to run their homes. Secondly, directors are keen to have this power. They do not think that it is administratively depressive, and if the new system of having a care manager works properly all the difficulties about locating these small homes will disappear. They will be known to the care manager. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can give an assurance that the matter will be given serious attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is important, and so is the second one but I cannot recall its terms exactly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To help my hon. Friend to organise his thoughts, will he reflect on the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham was holding up the registered homes tribunals in a positive light for the work that it has done? My concern is that examples also exist that put homes tribunals in a negative light. Some of their actions have not been in the interests of residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend will accept, and it is clear from the to-ing and fro-ing of the Government Whip, that a general consensus is developing in Committee that some constraint must be placed on those who are allowed to take responsibility for running homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham referred to a schedule of offences which she felt should—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has concentrated all our minds this morning is the need to ensure high standards of care. Hon. Members will know that our intention is to provide a mixed economy of care to ensure that those growing numbers of elderly and vulnerable people receive care appropriate to their needs and to give them a choice of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have drawn attention to the effectiveness of the Registered Homes Act 1924. That, and other initiatives from the Government, has drawn attention to the importance of raising standards for those in residential care. We have considered at length whether the public or private sector is particularly vulnerable. The amendment is concerned with homes for fewer than four people.
