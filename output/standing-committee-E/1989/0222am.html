	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 57</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>FINANCIAL PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause interacts closely with clause 9 and with schedule 3, so I shall be dealing with those parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Health will consult the explanatory memorandum which was produced for the Committee at my request. My hon. Friends have copies of it. I presume that it has been circulated to all members of the Committee. That document, perhaps for the most naive reasons, has been discussed in several health authorities. Although the document may seem elementary to civil servants— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but there is an unacceptable, buzz of conversation which prevents my giving full attention to the hon. Gentleman's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that Ministers will arrange for that document, or a similar one, to be circulated to finance officers of DHAs, and to the treasurers of county authorities, so that it can be circulated to social service directors. It could also be circulated to the chief executives of district councils so that they can forward it to their housing officers, because housing officer responsibilities arise from the Bill, especially for housing benefit. That is the case even when housing benefit calculations are made by treasurers of DHAs that are the housing authorities in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several questions to put to the Under-Secretary about clause 57, even though we have already debated clause 9, with which it interacts closely. Clause 9(1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each NHS trust shall have an originating capital debt of an amount specified in an order made by the Secretary of State, being an amount representing the excess of the valuation of the assets transferred or to be transferred to the trust under section 8 above over the amounts of the liabilities transferred or to be transferred to it under that section."</p></blockquote>
That involves the question of assets over liabilities. Finance officers of DHAs will draw up inventories of equipment, property and land available to them. I understand the assets that will be involved but I am not clear what will comprise the liabilities. Will the Under-Secretary set out what liability might be taken into account when the calculation is made? I ask that because clause 57(1)(a) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>any sums required by the Secretary of State for making loans to a National Health Service trust".</p></blockquote>
In that sense we are dealing, in part, with the question of originating capital debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1186</span>
Clause 57(1)(b) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any sums required by the Secretary of State for fulfilling a guarantee of a sum borrowed by a National Health Service trust".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us from what sources NHS trusts will be able to borrow money? As I recall, Schedule 3 refers to the need for trusts to borrow exclusively within the United Kingdom. As the Secretary of State in effect underwrites the borrowing by a guarantee that places the taxpayer at risk, do the Government intend to introduce any restrictions governing the sourcing of funds and the type of institutions from which trusts may borrow?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 57(1)(c) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any amount paid as public dividend capital under paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to this Act".</p></blockquote>
I understand that public dividend capital provides more flexibility in the service borrowing requirements of the organisations that can benefit by borrowing from sources defined by the Secretary of State. That originated from the nationalised industries' complaint that they were at a disadvantage compared to private sector companies, which could borrow by way of equity raising, whereas nationalised industries were geared to raising capital and having to pay an annual dividend on it. Might that be used as a means of subsidising NHS trusts, in that public dividend capital could provide for non-payment of interest over an extended period, perhaps with a write-off of interest that might otherwise arise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As NHS trusts will be competing in the same market as directly managed hospitals, will this provision give them an in-built advantage? I assume that in loans to directly managed hospitals a national interest rate will be taken into account in calculating their costs. Will there be a differential that might unreasonably work in favour of an NHS trust hospital?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9(4) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"an NHS trust's 'initial loan'"</p></blockquote>
and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a rate of interest on the initial loan shall be determined as if section 5 of the National Loans Act 1968 had effect in respect of it and subsections (5) to (5B) of that section shall apply accordingly."</p></blockquote>
Will initial loans be treated in the same way as subsequent loans? Will there be an advantage in an NHS trust applying for an initial loan greater than its immediate need, in order to avoid having to pay a higher rate of interest on loans that it might otherwise have to take out? I draw the distinction between initial loans and the subsequent loan requirements of a trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9(5) relates to the Secretary of State's responsibilities as defined in Clause 57 and provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the event of the early repayment of the initial loan, the terms may require the payment of a premium or allow a discount."</p></blockquote>
I do not recall us dealing with that in our earlier sittings. What is the reference to "a premium"? Is not that a penalty on early repayment of loan? If so, what is the justification for that? Moreover, what is the reference to "a discount"? Why should a discount be allowable for an NHS trust when, in open competition with a directly managed hospital, the district health authority might not have that same facility? Will the Minister comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 57(1)(d) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any expenses of the Secretary of State under this Act",</p></blockquote>
and the clause states that they shall be paid
	<br><blockquote><p>"out of moneys provided by Parliament".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0998">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1187</span>
I refer the Committee to an article in 	<i>The Independent</i> today entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consultants lose ruling on NHS spending".</p></blockquote>
There was a ruling in the High Court yesterday against
	<br><blockquote><p>"claims by six consultants, led by Harry Keen, Professor of Human Metabolism at Guy's Hospital, South London, that the Government had jumped the gun and shown a 'disregard of constitutional restraint'".</p></blockquote>
The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ruling prevents delays in preparations for the most far-reaching changes in the NHS's 42-year history. The court was told that £40 million had been allocated in 1989–90 and £257 million earmarked for preparations in 1990–91."</p></blockquote>
It further states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Much of the expenditure has gone in preparing applications for 78 hospitals and NHS units interested in self-governing status. Lord Justice Woolf said … health authorities were obliged to prepare for possible changes if they thought them desirable for hospitals."</p></blockquote>
It seems that the expenditure of £40 million and £257 million—in other words about £300 million—is being incurred by local health authorities, perhaps in preparing for the implementation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, paragraph (d) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any expenses of the Secretary of State under this Act".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps we are dealing with those expenses. Or, will those expenses be drawn from the existing budgets of DHAs? Are they additional moneys to be provided for by the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask that question because, as we all know, DHAs are carrying out much work in preparation for the Bill and one wonders where the money is coming from. Who is paying at present? Is it coming out of moneys that would otherwise be allocated to patient care? Or, are they additional moneys to be voted by Parliament under the provision of clause 57(l)(d)? Will the Minister clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that some of that money could go to make up the deficit faced by many DHAs, including the one in my constituency? I shall meet the Minister early next week to discuss the £1.2 million deficit faced by the DHA. Consultants have warned that, if it goes through, people on waiting lists will die.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Minister will clarify whether patient care has been affected in any way by the use of DHA budgets in preparation for the Bill and the new community care and general hospital arrangements. I am sure that he will want to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 57(e) deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"any increase attributable to this Act in the sums so payable under any other enactment."</p></blockquote>
I wish to draw attention to the explanatory memorandum produced by departmental officials. I thank them—one of the civil servants concerned with its production is present today—for their efforts in drawing it up. If my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has a copy of the document, he may like to follow me as I go through it. Does my hon. Friend have a copy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can identify the revenue source for money whch is defined as additional expenditure in the document. I turn to the section on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1188</span>
proposed provision for the future of existing clients. I want to go through the areas where I think that we are talking about additional resources, whether it be for the DHAs or for the local authorities directly. I am trying to ascertain where the money will come from. Will it come from social security payments? Will it be additional to the budget? That was partly dealt with the other day, I understand. Will it be additional to the revenue allocations to county authorities, or is it money that will be funnelled through the system in some other way? The document also refers to "topping up" extended to nursing homes. Where will that money come from, and on what basis would it be allocated to whatever authority is making the payment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the section headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"New clients when new scheme in operation proposed provisions".</p></blockquote>
Under paragraph (a) "Nature of Funds", sub-paragraph (iv) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority support (to meet balance of cost of place negotiated by Local authority".</p></blockquote>
From where exactly will that money come? There is a reference to local social service authorities at the bottom, but on what basis will that money be given to those authorities? Will it be on top of what they already get? Will it be new money, or will it come out of existing budgets?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (b) of the same section deals with the source of funds. Under sub-paragraph (ii), it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local Housing Authorities (largely reimbursed by central Government)",</p></blockquote>
the operative word being "largely". Largely means not altogether, so we are talking about a balance of moneys. Where will that money come from? Will it come from existing budgets? Could it have the effect of reducing moneys available for other areas of local authority expenditure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under sub-paragraph (iii) in the second column, in the section headed.
	<br><blockquote><p>"New clients when new scheme in operation proposed provisions",</p></blockquote>
there appears the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will mean that most residents will contribute less and the local authority correspondingly more."</p></blockquote>
Again, that is an area of additional expenditure for local authorities. Can that also be clarified? Will it be new money or additional money? Where will it come from, and will it affect existing provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, overleaf there is reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Responsibility of LA"—</p></blockquote>
local authority—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for care needs assessment".</p></blockquote>
In the first column, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Care needs assessment to be carried out by the local authority before care at the public expense is arranged".</p></blockquote>
Again, it is expenditure for local authorities. Where will the money come from? Will it be new money? Will existing budgets be affected? I am asking for greater clarification of the funding arrangements made by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Column 3 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority care needs assessment required before admission. Local authorities will have the responsibility of ensuring that placement in one of their homes is the appropriate type of care."</p></blockquote>
The same questions apply: where will the money come from? Will it be new money? To what extent will it be compensated for in whatever moneys are made available? Is it local authority expenditure? I have identified in the document what I believe are additional areas of expenditure. I am sure that people outside this place will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0999">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1189</span>
pore over these matters in far greater detail. Many organisations are anxious to know where the money is coming from. Will it be from DHAs, social security, social services, housing or revenue accounts? Is it additional to existing budgets and will it affect existing expenditure profiles of local authorities and the priorities already set?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) for opening the debate on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. He has enabled me to press the Minister on the new system of allocation to health authorities. A curio of the Bill is that no explicit provision has been made for a change that is likely to have dramatic effects on the financial environment of health authorities. Before we agree to clause 57, which makes proposals for future funding of health authorities, it seems sensible to give our attention to Government proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government apparently plan to convert the present system of allocation to health authorities from the historic basis of reflecting expenditure primarily in respect of the number of hospitals they administer into allocation that is based on resident population. The sole reason for the change, as my hon. Friends will immediately understand, is to facilitate the trading environment that the Bill will create, so that health authorities buy and sell from one another. Purely because of their ideological commitment to an internal market in health care, the Government find themselves obliged by the logic of that market to create a dramatically new and different way of allocating funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use the word "dramatically" as it is the only way of describing what is likely to happen to the allocations. We received no illustrative figures from the Government, so we attempted ourselves to calculate what the system would mean for English health authorities. We did so as best we could with professional statistical advice. We fed into the computer the various considerations in working paper 2 as the basis for the new resident-based allocation to health authorities. The figures showed extraordinary—almost incredible—losses to many major health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bloomsbury DHA is at the top of the list. Under the new system it would end up with a cash difference of £78 million less than its current allocation. Bloomsbury is the characteristic inner city health authority, with all the problems that go with that status. It also has large specialised teaching hospitals which take patients from other areas. I am well aware of the frequently-expressed Conservative view—the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), the exponent of this view whose expression was the most eloquent, has not yet joined us but is to be seen—that large central health authorities can accept cuts because they have had it easy compared with the landward and rather more difficult health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the large inner city health authorities who fare badly under the new system. For example, there is Aylesbury Vale, which is not an area characteristically associated with inner city areas. Under the new arrangements, the Aylesbury Vale DHA would lose £36 million; Salisbury DHA would lose £16 million. Surrey does not appear to do too well under the system which the Minister is commending to the Committee. East Surrey would lose £16 million, Mid-Surrey around £11 million; Kingston and Esher, £9 million. Another place not characteristically associated with strong Labour support and inner city problems is Dartford, which loses £3 million. Last night I addressed 450 people in Dartford who were
	<span class='label label-info column'>1190</span>
protesting against the Government's plans. The current chairman of Dartford and Gravesham DHA who was the former Conservative Member for Dartford until 1987, today announced that he would not be reappointed because of his dispute with the Government over the construction of the new district general hospital for Dartford. If the Government do not build this hospital, there will be some difficulty with their proposals for the future of the NHS as the unbuilt hospital in Dartford is one of the 72 which expressed an interest in opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dramatic losses in the budgets of health authorities are of concern. Many of the authorities which will lose out under the new revenue allocation system are precisely the same authorities which will be hit hard under the new regime of capital charge. By definition, those health authorities which lose out are the ones with large hospitals; the health authorities with large hospitals are the ones with large capital payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it not occurred to the hon. Gentleman that those health authorities which currently receive substantial allocations under the resource receive substantial allocations under the resource allocation working party system—they tend to be the ones with substantial hospitals—will be best placed to exploit the opportunities opened up by the Bill to tender for the provision of secondary medical services to residents of other districts? When they succeed in such tenders, whether the patients come from other DHAs or from fund-holding general practices, the money will come with the patients from outside the areas in which the hospitals are located. As a result, the balance will be redressed by those who gain in terms of allocations under the new system, with those authorities within the internal market paying over sums to those districts which appear superficially to be the losers under the new system. It will be an open market, and therefore open to those districts to resolve the problem to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying has nothing to do with the RAWP. The RAWP goes anyway. I was exercising the restraint of not querying the question of the RAWP going anyway, although there will be the problem of seeking the redistribution of resources which the RAWP was intended to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my intervention is to focus on the swings and roundabouts that will come from the shift from historic bases of expenditure to resident-based allocation. The hon. Gentleman raised an interesting point, which I shall return to later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1000">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1191</span>
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is precisely those health authorities that face the largest losses on the resident-based allocation that are likely to have high capital charges. I shall use three examples, which are all in the top 16 of health authorities that will lose most under the new resident-based allocation. South Manchester will face a loss of £46 million, but in addition it will face £11 million in capital charges, as 8 per cent. of existing use value. Newcastle will lose 52 per cent.—£68 million—and it will face a capital charge of £12 million. Wakefield—I hope that the DHA in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffc) does not feature in the top 16 because he volunteered for the Committee—will face a loss of 35 per cent. which is £16 million, and a capital charge of £5.5 million. Health authorities with large hospitals will face a double penalty and a double financial problem because of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) has reasonably and lucidly explained the function that the proposed system is supposed to support, which is the trading environment in which health authorities desperately try to recoup massive financial allocation losses by selling their services. If they sell their services, other health authorities must buy them, and that raises a challenging and novel point which I had not considered until after I appeared on television for the second time complaining about health authority losses under the proposed system. Following that appearance I received a blistering letter from the chairman of a DHA which will supposedly be one of the gainers and will receive more money under the proposed allocation. His complaint was that although his DHA would receive more money under the resident-based allocation, he would lose the freedom to refer his residents, effectively free of charge, to hospitals within the authorities that would be the financial losers. Therefore, he regarded his health authority, although technically a gainer in financial allocation, as a loser, because it would have to pay for every operation that he obtained for his residents who were in the hospitals to which the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of taste whether one regards the new system as penalising the inner city areas which will lose the financial allocation that presently supports their hospitals, or the health authorities which appear to be financial gainers from the swings and roundabouts but find themselves equally caught by the trading requirements, as they will have to buy operations without the guarantee that they will have the finances to do so, even if there is an enhanced budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the causes of the reasonable and legitimate anxiety about the proposed system is that it occurs against the background of underfunding of health authorities. That underfunding is well documented, and has recently been repeatedly documented. I carried out a survey, which is well known—particularly to the hon. Member for Pembroke, who took such interest in my stationery—of every health authority, which showed that in November two out of three health authorities were projecting a deficit by the end of the financial year. As they had no legal power to run up such a deficit, most health authorities were taking emergency avoiding action which involved cuts in services. That was the only method available to them.

The latest check was carried out this week in a BBC survey of health authorities. I look forward to learning whether the hon. Member for Pembroke discovers whether its survey was carried out at the expense of public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When Opposition spokespersons ask the Government a question and are told that the Government do not collect the necessary information centrally, they try to obtain the information themselves in order to fulfil their Opposition responsibilities. Surely when, fulfilling their Front-Bench responsibilities, they collect information that is a matter of public interest, it is wrong that they be penalised by having to pay out of their own pockets. If the Government are so lax that they fail to collect important information, shadow Secretaries of State should be encouraged to gain such information and place it on record, not be subjected to financial penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Livingston, who is the Opposition spokesman, is as entitled to be heard as any other Committee member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham that, at my request, the Services Committee is examining the problem. The BBC Survey showed that one third of all DHAs project a deficit for the end of the financial year. As the end of the financial year is barely a month away, we can be fairly certain that that third—80 out of 218—will be in debt under the new system. I know, from our exchanges on Tuesday, that the Under-Secretary of State for Health is prone to saying that current funding is separate from future funding, and that the problem is the result of an incremental change in the system. Nevertheless,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1001">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1193</span>
if such changes take place against present underfunding, there is a serious danger that a grim situation will be made worse for health authorities that lose resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note from the BBC survey that the West Lambeth authority will face a deficit of £8.9 million unless it makes emergency cuts, which I think that it is meeting to consider today. West Lambeth is the fourth biggest loser under the new resident-based system of allocation, and is set to lose £59 million. Parkside has projected that it will have a deficit next year of £4.6 million unless it takes emergency action to reduce expenditure. Parkside is based mainly on the Paddington DHA, which, according to our computer print-out, is the third largest loser. It will lose £60 million under the new system of allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened the other day to the Secretary of State's response to the survey in a radio interview. He attributed the deficits to the poor planning of Health Service spending. I was interested to hear that he did not realise that he had played any part in the poor planning of Health Service expenditure. If the problem faced by the health authorities is the result of poor planning, how can they plan their expenditure against the forthcoming switchback of revenue allocation? Given the immense changes contemplated in the next five years, to achieve stability would be a triumph of forecasting, never mind planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Government do if the health authorities that the Secretary of State identified as guilty of poor planning in the allocation of Health Service resources prove incapable of planning? I would not blame them for that, given the massive swings and roundabouts in the new system of funding health authorities. What will happen if the inner-city health authorities that lose large revenue sums cannot recoup that loss by selling their services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alternative view was expressed by the chairman of a health authority that gains under the system. What will happen if he, and other chairmen in the same position, cannot buy the operations that they need within their new fixed budget? The dramatic changes in the funding will put health authorities in an entirely new and different financial environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I view with great apprehension Ministers' act of faith— their belief that once the system has been created, the trading environment will smooth out the variations. They believe that it will effect the transfer of resources essential under the new system of allocation if health authorities are to balance their books and to secure the operations that their residents need. Before that breathtaking leap the Minister should say whether there are safety nets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) set off on a long journey and came back to where he started. He gave a list of the authorities that he claimed would be losers under the new system. He did not give a satisfactory reply to my intervention, and after that he felt sufficiently unsure of his ground to argue that the so-called gainers would lose. At one point, he proposed that it was possible for everyone to lose. I do not know what stage the hon. Gentleman reached in elementary mathematics, but he surely cannot expect the Committee to accept that if the funds held by the system as a whole remained the same, and the distribution changed, everyone would lose. That argument does not pass muster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1194</span>
The source of the hon. Gentleman's confusion is that it is not possible to know in advance who among the providers will lose and who will gain. That is inherent in the concept of a market. We are more concerned with the welfare of the consumers—the patients—than the providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as a market results in a more efficient use of the available resources, the patients, in aggregate, will be the net gainers. That is the most important aim that will be achieved if the bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to argue that a market will not achieve a more efficient use of resources than the present directed system. I suggest that the hon. Member for Livingston reflects on that proposition carefully before advancing it in the context of health care or any other context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have noticed that whenever the hon. Gentleman speaks, he always looks up at something near the clock. My hon. Friends and I wonder whether he had some divine inspiration for his market philosophy. Perhaps he could explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was adopting the old-fashioned habit of addressing the Chair rather than the Committee, which seems to be considered by some to be out of fashion these days. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not feel unduly neglected, and I shall make a point of turning deliberately in his direction from time to time when I speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market structure which is being introduced here— call it an internal market or what you will, but it obviously has genuine market elements—differs substantially from the fundamental economic structure of the Health Service as established in 1948. It differs in several important ways. One is that it introduces for the first time the concept of a division of labour. It is a common principle in both capitalist and socialist economics—and has been since Adam Smith, I believe—that all other things being equal, the greater the division of labour, the more effective will be the use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By allowing health authorities to build up the specialities in which they have a comparative advantage and to offer the services of those specialities to a wider range of people, there will be a better use of resources. It is a simple concept, and if the hon. Member for Livingston seriously disagrees with it he will have to admit to the Committee that he believes that human activity is better based on some concept of perfect computation and planning or perfect bureaucracy. The sooner he comes out in the open and recommends a cost-planned structure to manage the Health Service and every other activity where scarce resources need to be managed, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another way in which under the Government's measures concurrent with the Bill, all other things being equal, resources will almost inevitably be more effectively used. For the first time, hospital managers will have a proper idea of what their costs are. It passes belief that it can seriously be argued that available resources will be used more efficiently if it is not known what the costs are. Hitherto hospital managers have not known whether it would be cheaper for them to subcontract a hip replacement operation, or whatever it might be, to the private sector or to have it done in their hospital, for the simple reason that they did not know what the cost was in their hospitals. I can hardly believe that the Opposition seriously think that a knowledge of the cost base, all other things being equal, will not lead to a more efficient use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1002">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1195</span>
It is a question of costs and prices, because for the first time there will be an element of competition. Several different prices will be on offer from the private sector, NHS trust hospitals and the DHAs, so there will be a competitive market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman argues about market forces. I have talked to the general manager of the general hospital in my area and he knows what his costs are. We shall be discussing those costs with him and his financial advisers on 9th March, even down to the cost of surgical gloves, to see where savings could be made. The worry is that if he finds it cheaper to go somewhere else for goods or services, following the market force philosophy, the unit costs of his hospital will rise as it is underused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No manager in the Health Service has the faintest idea of what his time costs are—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must allow me to speak. He has asked his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On point of order, Dame Janet. The hon. Gentleman has said that the general manager of the hospital in my constituency does not know what his costs are, when I have just informed him that we shall be discussing those costs on 9th March. Is he calling the general manager a liar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, that is not a point of order for the Chair. It is a point that relates to the substance of debate. Hon. Members must make the distinction between the two. If points of fact are challenged, it should be in an intervention, which can then be dealt with in the normal way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the problem is not so much a lack of honesty in the district general manager concerned but a lack of understanding on the hon. Gentleman's part of the concept of cost. Thanks to the information systems put at the disposal of hospital managers by this Government, that hospital managers may have a sense of the variable costs in his hospital. However, no hospital manager at present has the faintest idea of his or her fixed costs, for the simple reason that until the Bill is enacted and the Government's reforms are implemented no hospital will have any concept of depreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health care has what is known in technical jargon as a high operational gearing—in other words, a high ratio of fixed to variable costs. It is therefore precisely one of those areas of activity where if one does not know what the fixed costs are, one is completely incapable of making even a stab at guessing what the real costs are. That is the problem facing the district general manager mentioned by the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay). To give all due credit to the district general manager, I suspect that he has a much more sophisticated understanding of the problems which we are discussing than the hon. Gentleman has. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take the opportunity in the meeting to which he has referred to brief himself a little on these important issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1196</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the hon. Gentleman's information, I and others meet the general manager twice a year, and costs are one of the items that we consider. When I had an operation, the anaesthetist quietly informed me as he put me under that had I gone to the private hospital where he worked, the operation would have cost twice as much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the hon. Gentleman's several interventions that he still has not grasped the essential distinction between fixed and variable costs. I shall be happy to explain it to him later if he wishes, or he may wish to take the opportunity of the meetings with his district general manager and the finance officers of the district authority to pursue the matters separately. I do not think that it should take up any more of the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I insist that when considering the economic impact of the Bill on health care we should give full credit to what the Government are doing about depreciation. The Opposition say that depreciation is a means of imposing additional costs on DHAs and RHAs, but it is a necessary means of recognising costs which inevitably occur and which have always existed, since 1948. The failure to recognise those costs has led to an enormous waste of resources and, therefore, to great damage to patients' interests and the NHS's ability to respond to patient demand. I congratulate the Government on having finally grasped that nettle and on having introduced the concept of depreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 57 give us an opportunity to discuss the economic impact of the Bill's provisions. We should not be concerned only with the directly identifiable incremental costs which will be imposed on the NHS under the Bill. Of course there will be costs of that sort, many of them administrative. We should not even be concerned with the net picture of incremental costs minus the savings that will be possible under the Bill, although that is more important. We have a dynamic system. There has been enormous real increase in NHS funding. The Bill will increase the aggregate efficiency with which resources are used in the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recall when such an argument was last deployed? I think that it was in the early 1970s during the passage of the Bill that dealt with local government reorganisation, when I was still in short pants. The argument that was used then was that if money were spent on increased administration, it would secure long-term benefits through the more cost-effective use of local authority revenues. Did not the whole thing go wrong because there was tremendous escalation in the costs that the hon. Gentleman mentioned? That legislation also led to many inefficiencies which the Government are only now trying to tackle through local government legislation and privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman was in short pants at that time, I suspect that I was in even shorter pants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a free market in local authorities, because we cannot choose between them unless we are willing to move house. I should like to be able to choose to join a more efficient local authority and to pay the lower charges that would result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will lay the foundation for ensuring that resources will be used more effectively in health and community care provision. Until now there has been a Chinese wall between the various bodies that are supposed to care for people in the community. The practice of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1003">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1197</span>
assessment means for the first time that someone will look at the needs of the patient or of the person who needs care, which is an enormous improvement in human terms. I welcome assessment above all for that reason, regardless of whether it saves money, or whether it increases the efficiency with which resources are used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under current arrangements many people are dumped in residential care at considerable cost to the DSS. Those people could be kept more cheaply at home, which is where I am sure we should all prefer to be. To say that community care can apply to people who are in institutions is to use words incorrectly. Any institution, however humanely and competently managed, is still an institution. It does not compare with supporting people in their own homes, so that they can lead a normal life in their community. For the first time, we can avoid making crassly irrational decisions and prevent people from being kept in care as a result of bureaucratic inertia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is a plea to the Government. The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) seemed to criticise the Government for making a leap of faith. It is sometimes necessary in all decisions in life to make a leap of faith. One can be confronted with alternative models, all of which may have certain theoretical attractions. But finally a decision has to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many good reasons why the model put forward by the Government is an extremely hopeful one both for the NHS and community care. We cannot assess in advance its precise economic impact on the efficiency with which resources are used, or compare it with existing systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My plea to the Government is that, over the coming years, they will set in motion some mechanism which can examine these matters retrospectively and report to us from time to time. Various methods might achieve such an assessment. It is important that the British people feel that, in future, the best form of humane care is available to them, and that the increasing resources which we know will have to be spent on the vital matters of health and community care—resources bound to increase faster than national income—will be managed increasingly efficiently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr Roger Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) asked me eight questions, which I will answer briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He first asked whether the document, "Support for People in Homes," could be circulated to local authorities and DHAs. I can assure him that the substance of it, or perhaps even more detail, will be circulated. I am not convinced that this document is the definitive answer for the individuals to which he refers: the county treasurers, finance officers of DHAs and chief executives of district councils. But this and more information will be circulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, he asked what liabilities NHS trusts would take over. They would have only those liabilities that a hospital would incur in the ordinary course of its business—for example, liabilities for the supply of equipment, drugs or hospital supplies. The hon. Gentleman knows the difference between an authority being in balance on income and expenditure, and being in balance on cash budget. Income expenditure takes account of debtors and creditors at the end of the year. At the end
	<span class='label label-info column'>1198</span>
of the financial year, 31st March, every hospital has liabilities in the normal course of receiving supplies or services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman wanted to know what the guarantees were, and where National Health trusts would borrow from. NHS Trusts will have an external financing limit set by the Government, and the limit for each year is their gross capital expenditure less the amount of cash that they have to pay for it. That cash is clearly the surplus before providing for depreciation, which is a non-cash charge, but after payment of interest on public debt and any public dividend capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS trust is free to borrow the money from wherever it wishes, but with the guarantee of the Secretary of State, who is empowered by the Bill to give such guarantees. Although we do not prescribe that the trust should borrow from the Treasury, in most cases it will borrow from the Treasury because the Government's credit is clearly better than that of any individual part of the public sector unguaranteed. The cheapest rate will usually come from the state, but perhaps borrowing from local banks to tide over a working capital requirement, or an expansion requirement, may be more flexible and arranged more quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that trusts may call on the Government for guarantees. In what circumstances does he think that they would do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought in all circumstances. In some instances—perhaps the need for specific finance for equipment, or an extension to a hospital—the amount in question may be too small or the trust may have such a good, lasting relationship with the local bank that it may not be necessary; but I imagine that most borrowings would be guaranteed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fourth point related to public dividend capital and whether the Secretary of State could excuse a trust from paying dividends, thus subsidising it at the expense of directly managed hospitals. That will not be possible. Two obligations will be placed on trusts. First, they must earn a regular return of 6 per cent. in real terms before payment of interest on debt and dividends on public dividend capital. The mechanism by which they pay that 6 per cent. return can be apportioned between interest and debt, depending upon the capitalisation. The 6 per cent. is the same requirement as that imposed upon directly managed hospitals. Secondly, year by year, the trust must break even after paying debt interest and public dividend capital payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the extent that the Government permit a remission of dividend obligations, or waive or reduce the public dividend capital rate, they will allow the trust to keep more cash, but it is cash that will go to meet expenditure requirements that, in effect, have been sanctioned by the Treasury—so the taxpayer will not pay twice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about sources from which trusts could borrow. Will he comment on this hypothetical example? Let us suppose that a hospital wants to buy a particularly expensive machine and casts around in the market to see what is available, after which a company offers to provide finance for the purchase. The terms may be flexible in the early years but, overall, the cost of borrowing may be more than the Government want NHS trusts to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1199</span>
Does the Minister think that restrictions should be imposed if hospitals decide to borrow money in this way? The trusts, in so far as they are independent, could be subjected to heavy commercial pressure to purchase equipment. A consultant may say, "I want that machine. I know that it costs £500,000, but I have almost negotiated the deal. The finance house is X, and it will cost Y". What would happen in such instances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be the responsibility of managers of NHS trusts to decide. The source of the pressure is not directly relevant to the ultimate responsibility, which is that of the trust's board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government borrowing may be cheaper in some instances. A leasing or hire purchase transaction may be contemplated, and borrowing may cost more. There is no prescription. If a hospital decides to borrow expensively, it has the freedom to do so. My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) deployed eloquent arguments for the powers of the Audit Commission which, as the new statutory auditor of the Health Service, will have something to say about value for money and about not borrowing from the Government. I anticipate that that will be a powerful check on the financing techniques and policies of NHS trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether a trust could over-borrow. The answer is: no. When a trust is established, its initial capitalisation will equal the net assets transferred by the Secretary of State to the trust. The net assets are assets at proper valuation of land and buildings less liabilities. I have explained the type of liabilities that will be transferred. We shall ensure that trusts do not take excess assets with them. We will not transfer surplus assets. Technically, therefore, a trust cannot over-borrow from the state because its opening capitalisation is equal to the transferred assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the assessment and transition of assets a hospital, perhaps a mental hospital, may be sending people out into the community and may already have made provision for selling off, its land. Often such hospitals are extremely big houses in extensive grounds in the middle of nowhere. Pressure may be brought to bear by the community because of under-provision in a different sector if, say, mental patients cannot be cared for properly in the community and other sectors demand that the process be halted and provision be made for the following year so that patients are not turfed out into the street. What flexibility will there be to allow trust managements to provide accommodation for such patients?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that we debated mental illness provision on Tuesday. I cannot envisage trusts being created for mental illness institutions that are in the process of closure. Of course it cannot be ruled out—it is not inconceivable—but such a hospital would not be an ideal candidate for a trust because it would be in a state of major transition from caring institutionally to caring in the community. That aside, if such an institution applied to be a trust, the Secretary of State would have to take account of its plans, of what assets were to be released from the land and buildings vacated, and where the money was going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1200</span>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) intervened to ask about ring fencing, I made it plain that both mental illness and mental handicap services in the NHS are, in a sense, ring-fenced. Money coming from the release of land and buildings of a mental handicap or mental illness institution must go back—this is stated in regulations—into provision for that client group, although not necessarily within the Health Service because with mental handicap, money coming by way of dowry and lump sum can be transferred across statutory boundaries to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sixth question from the hon. Member for Workington was whether repayment of a loan at a discount or premium might in some way be unfair to directly managed hospitals. If he thinks about it, he will realise that it is usual, sensible practice. With early loan repayment, the prevailing interest rate is used to value the loan. If interest rates have risen, the value of the loan falls for early repayment; the converse applies to corporate entities. When prepaying the loan, the person receiving back the cash—in this instance, the Secretary of State—receives it earlier than he otherwise would, and can re-invest it at higher interest. Therefore he would be prepared to accept a lower cash sum on repayment. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the practice will not affect the way in which directly managed hospitals can compete with NHS trust hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seventh question was about the £250 million allocated for 1990–91 preparatory to the White Paper. Lord Justice Woolf ruled that it was legal for the Secretary of State to make certain preparations in anticipation of the Bill being enacted. Most of the money has nothing to do with legislation. The £83 million resource management initiative for 1990–91 has nothing to do with the Bill, neither has the £25 million for medical nor the money for HISP, the hospital integrated support system. The Bill contains no provision for the preparation of an asset register; it is the capital charges that require legislation. Much of that has nothing to do with the Bill. They are review proposals. In so far as they relate to legislation, Lord Justice Woolf said that preparations can be made and that they are legitimate. But no actions can be taken, no trusts or fund holders named until the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is important. It implies that Mr. Jack O'Sullivan, the journalist in 	<i>The Independent,</i> was wrong when he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court was told that £40 million had been allocated in 1989–90 and £257 million earmarked for preparations in 1990–91"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Much of the expenditure has gone in preparing applications for 78 hospitals and NHS units interested in self-governing status."</p></blockquote>
That relates directly to the Bill. Who is paying that money? Will the money be allocated under clause 57(1)(c)? Surely it relates to the Bill. Moreover, should any of that money come out of existing DHA budgets? That is a fair question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should guarantee that no expenditure arising from the introduction of the Bill will fall on the DHA allocations for the current year. If he cannot give that undertaking, it means that money will come out of patient care. That is the undertaking that I want as, I believe, does my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman intervened, I was trying to answer his seventh point by dealing with that issue. He has just raised two matters, the first of which is the legality of payments. Not all the £250 million, only a very small proportion, relates to the preparations for NHS trust or fund holders. There is legal power to do that under section 97 of the 1977 Act, and Lord Justice Woolf ruled that it is legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and more importantly, the hon. Gentleman asked whether it is at the expense of patient care. The answer is no. The 8.5 per cent. cash increase in allocations to regions does not take account, except to a modest degree, of the £250 million expenditure on the review. They are separate and largely departmentally-held funds which are allocated, for example, with the resource management initiative or other schemes when those schemes are selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the funding of preparations for the Bill's enactment and the implementation of changes that do not require legislative support will not be at the expense of patient care. At the least, the provision will ensure that patient care services are maintained. Those assurances are only at the aggregate; I cannot give such an assurance for each district health authority. I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's comments about residency funding and weighted capitation. But, in aggregate, I give him that assurance. The 8.5 per cent. increase in cash allocation from the Secretary of State to the regions excluded the bulk of that money because, by definition, it was not allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the precise amount but it will be modest; I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to give him an assessment of how much in the 8.5 per cent. of the £250 million was allocated as opposed to withheld centrally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Event after deduction of that modest proportion, there will still be a real increase, in resources available to the hospital service, even making assumptions about the rate of inflation applying to the Health Service for pay and prices,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's eighth point involved six questions about the document. I am sorry that I cannot answer those detailed questions now, but I undertake that my hon. Friend the Minister of State or I will write to him, if not today then by the close of business tomorrow. When he receives those answers, he may wish to pursue what mechanism to choose to put them on the public record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the letter can be sent to and received by me before next Tuesday's sitting, perhaps I can find a schedule to enable me to place these matters on the public record, with your permission, Dame Janet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our reply is a public reply and we have nothing to hide. We shall be happy to discuss with the hon. Gentleman how he communicates that to his colleagues and the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may deal briefly with the four substantive matters raised by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). First, he argued that the change to residency funding was solely for contracting. There is a connection, albeit not as strong, with weighted capitation. To achieve the full effect of weighted capitation, it must be done on the basis of funding for residence in an authority area, as opposed to funding the historic activity of a hospital in the district. Both are necessary. I concede that residency funding means moving money across district boundaries
	<span class='label label-info column'>1202</span>
through the medium of contracts. But there is a relationship to weighted capitation. So the hon. Gentleman was not strictly correct. I shall deal briefly with weighted capitation before I sit down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman said that there would be large losers, and cited Bloomsbury. He did not cite City and Hackney, which was much in my mind. Indeed, only 30 per cent. of the patients in St. Bartholomew's come from City and Hackney; 70 per cent. come from outwith the district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding for City and Hackney, Bloomsbury and most of the inner London DHAs decline; that is obvious because they import patients. But I give the hon. Member for Livingston the assurance, so eloquently expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), that for "losers" in residency funding there will be a comparable number of "gainers". In a sense, the resources simply flow around the system through the medium of contracting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman appears to confuse the concepts of residency funding and weighted capitation. I assure him that in 1991–92, the first year of residency funding, the provision of care for the residents of a catchment area will not fall; it will remain what it would have been if we had not moved to a system of contracting in residency funding. For example, the money allocated to the districts that send patients to St. Bart's will flow back into City and Hackney, to the trusts or directly managed hospitals. We intend the flow of patients, the referral pattern, to be broadly validated by the introduction of contracts in the first year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third question was about capital charges and their impact. I have already given him what I hope is a clear statement on capital charges. We shall fund all districts in 1991–92 for the consequences of the capital charges facing the patients who flow either within or outwith the district. There will be no change in 1991–92. Outlying districts such as Maidstone, Brighton and Thanet have been sending patients, largely for elective surgery, to the inner London hospitals. In time, they may decide that they need greater local provision and need not send patients such considerable distances. They will decide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The residents of the inner London districts, who must rely on inner London hospitals where capital charges will be relatively higher, will always be financed for those higher capital charges. Patients who need local services and access, say to St. Thomas's hospital because they live in Lambeth, must continue to be financed for the higher consequences entailed by capital charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fourth point was about health authorities in deficit. We shall try to eliminate, with only one or two exceptions, the deficits in income and expenditure during 1990–91 so that all districts can enter the new contracting mode from April 1991 without a carryforward deficit. I cannot guarantee that the deficit will be eliminated in each of the 190 districts, but we hope that it will be possible in the vast majority. Regions will take steps in the coming year to eliminate these deficits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston asked about ward closures and service cuts. The reforms outlined in the White Paper seek to give hospitals and districts a better chance to plan their activities at the beginning of the year so that they do not run out of money for elective, non-emergency surgery in month 10 or 11. I shall be happy to debate with the hon. Member for Livingston the level of resources at the beginning of the year, but not how resources are managed during the course of the year. I do not deny that some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1006">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1203</span>
districts and hospitals are in financial difficulties, but that is partly due to an over-enthusiastic expansion of services at the beginning of the year without careful planning of the consequences for the whole year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 702 relates to social work in Scotland and places a duty on local authorities to include among persons in need those who need care and attention arising from drug or alcohol dependency, or from release from prison or other form of detention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1204</span>
The motive behind the amendment is worth while and we support it; the problem is resourcing it—a greater problem than resourcing mental illness and mental handicap. There is much public sympathy for those suffering from mental illness and mental handicap, although I accept that many members of the public do not like having their hospitals, hostels and homes near them. There is nothing like as much public sympathy for those who are drug or alcohol dependent or who have just been released from prison. It would therefore be easy for local authorities not to fulfil the duties imposed upon them if resources were not available. The duty to such people would be the first to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always a local outcry about homes or care facilities being given to people who are drug or alcohol dependent rather than to other people in need of help from social services. In my constituency, the health board has set up a needle exchange in the new Castle Milk health centre. It is a worthwhile project and I support it, but it has created considerable local anxiety. My constituents are upset by the idea of drug addicts coming to the area to get new needles, and throwing old needles away, although I do not believe that that will happen. Will the Minister comment on the funding for this new element of social work in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has misunderstood the purpose of the amendment. It does not create a new policy, it maintains the existing one. Clients who can receive assistance in cash or kind under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 should include drug and alcohol abusers and expenders. The amendment replaces paragraph 2(8)(b) in the schedule, which is removed by amendment No. 491, in a more appropriate form. It ensures that clients are eligible for the services that they need but not, as is currently provided in the paragraph, for inappropriate services such as laundry and home help. It does not place an additional obligation on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have substantially increased the resources available to health boards in respect of drug abusers to try to tackle problems that are to be found in the honourable Gentleman's constituency and in other inner-city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the honourable Member for Cathcart that the proposal does not place an additional burden on local authorities, nor do the Government underestimate the importance of providing resources for the groups in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Patients should be able to claim assistance with travelling costs, wherever they are treated. They may have to cross borders to be treated in a DHA establishment or in NHS trust hospital. The existing hospital travel costs scheme be adapted to take account of the changes in the Bill so that it can be of maximum benefit to patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debate on clause 4 a few weeks ago my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health assured the Committee that the NHS hospital travel costs scheme
	<span class='label label-info column'>1208</span>
would remain in force under the Bill and that it would be publicised more widely to ensure that more eligible patients took advantage of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would contribute to this aim, but, equally importantly, it would ensure that while NHS trusts could pay patients' travelling costs, the costs would be reimbursed by the patients' district of residence. That is right, because it would introduce maximum flexibility to the system while maintaining ultimate responsibility where it should be. Travel costs should be borne by the DHA, which is responsible for securing comprehensive hospital and community health care for its residents. I hope that the Committee and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will look favourably on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) on the NHS travel costs scheme. I confess that I knew little about it until it came up in Committee. I sought to elicit further information from the Department of Health by way of a written answer which appeared in the 	<i>Official Report</i> in January. The figures given for the travel costs scheme were, for the year 1986–87, £3.037 million; for 1987–88, £3.263 million; and for 1988–89, £3.265 million. I thought those figures significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also significant that there has not been a large increase in the past two years; it has certainly been less than the rate of inflation. I do not suggest that we wilfully incur unnecessary costs, but I am encouraged by the answer given by my hon. Friend the Minister for Health. She stated that the Department was
	<br><blockquote><p>"currently considering measures to increase public awareness of the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Tuesday 30 January; vol. 166, c. 	<i>129.</i>]</p></blockquote>
I hope that we shall make better use of it, although, it would be unrealistic to expect health authorities automatically to fund all the travel costs of patients. That might cause inequities among those who have to travel long distances within a health authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A subsequent amendment deals with the islands. I added my suport to that amendment because it is of especial concern to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) and to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field), who pointed out that people who are separated by water from sources of treatment should be able to recover a proportion of the much higher costs incurred when getting treatment. I commend the sentiments of that amendment to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day), who outlined his case carefully and well. I am happy to accept the amendment. The principle behind the hospital travel costs scheme is that it should be widely known to those to whom it applies— and that is to say, those on income support and family credit. My hon. Friend's amendment would ensure that NHS trusts could reimburse those who travel to trust hospitals and reclaim the money from the patient's district of residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) referred to those travelling from outlying islands. Can I respond to that point, Dame Janet, or will you rule that out of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member is brief, he may deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the hospital travel scheme, there is a separate scheme which applies to those travelling from the Stilly Isles and the islands lying off the Scottish coast. It does not apply to the Isle of Wight, where there is an effective system of transport between the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth and Southampton. There is a separate scheme for the Highland area and the Isles of Stilly. As I am trespassing into an area where I am not fully briefed, I shall only speak for the Isles of Stilly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister says about the islands and that, in a whispered comment, he was advised by his hon. Friend, the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, that it is islands in the Highland areas. However, there are islands in the Clyde estuary. The island of Arran springs to my mind automatically. It is not in the Highland area, or the Strathclyde regional area, but it is in the Highlands and Islands Development Board area. The ferry cost for a car, for example, is £45 return, plus passenger costs. There is a substantial difference between that and travelling by car or train from any other part of Strathclyde region, and I wonder whether that area would be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dame Janet, it would be helpful if I could deal with that point as it is in my area of responsibility. The special travel scheme described by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health as applying to the Stilly Isles applies also to all health boards which are located in the Highland area, including the Island board, the Highland health board and part of Argyll and Clyde. Under the scheme operating in the Highland area, patients can claim travelling expenses regardless of their means, although they are required to contribute the first £5 towards the costs. In cases where people are below the income support level, the £5 contribution can be reimbursed. The scheme provides for travelling costs to be met on the basis that people can reclaim the costs of their petrol or rail or air transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that this matter affects places such as the Isles of Stilly and the islands off Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak to new clause 12, which stands in my name. I note that the amendments grouped with it refer to Scotland when my thinking relates to England. In view of the dense drafting of the provisions, I owe it to the Committee to explain what is happening and the circumstances which prompted me to attend to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background is to ventilate the conclusions of a report which was recently published on charity in the NHS. This was prepared as Research Paper No. 1 by the Directory of Social Change, which is associated with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Hon. Members will be aware that I am chairman of the all-party working group on charity law—obviously I have no brief from it—and that many other hon. Members are active in charitable matters and committed to the voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 should also add that Scottish law is different from English law in relation to charity because there is no Charity Commission there. This is essentially a charitable clause rather than a Health Service one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1216</span>
In 1948, existing endowments to hospitals were effectively pooled and nationalised. Somewhat reluctantly, a provision was made for those people wishing to make donations. Those were the founding moments of the hospital trusts, which have grown from that time. They have always been in some doubt as they were the first derogation from a purely state-financed health service, and always susceptible to anomalies and the fact that some areas fund better than others and some sectors attract more donations than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attitude, which I put four square to the Committee, is that the demands of health care, which have been well explored over the past two or three months by the Committee, are so enormous that any additional funds from charitable sources are always welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those funds must be regulated properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report concluded that the role of charity in the NHS was confused and that its appeal was muted. It said that the existing structure in which charity operated was ineffective and controversial, and that, as a result, the total NHS charitable assets of nearly £600 million, and the annual income of over £170 million, were not applied as effectively as they could be. Sadly, I agree with that conclusion, and my new clause would address at least part of that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is tied to NHS hospital trusts, but I shall spare the Committee details of the way in which it would operate. There would be three categories of charitable funds, which I shall summarize.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there would be special trustees of funds that are typically but not universally held by teaching hospitals under the present arrangement. Those may continue, and the new clause would not extinguish them. Guy's or Bart's or wherever would continue with the separate special trustees that they have now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, my new clause would apply to a hospital that adopts grant-maintained status. It is designed to ensure that, in addition to the main NHS hospital trust, there would be a separate body of trustees to look after the charitable funds that were, I say for brevity's sake, "attached" to that hospital. The Secretary of State could make an order when he sets up an NHS trust which would vest those charitable funds in the hands of special trustees for those funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, charitable funds that are currently held by DHAs or RHAs are not touched by the proposals, but there might be a case for establishing special trustees for them to give a better focus to the charitable side. That is not dealt with in the new clause, but it is relevant, and my hon. Friend might want to reflect whether he has or could take powers to cover or at least encourage that practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have kept the new clause flexible so that the Secretary of State and the trusts, will be able to move assets around as administrative arrangements occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee for the wording in the new clause. It is confusing because it mentions "NHS trusts", and "special trustees" who are associated with, but not part of those trusts. I offer a small prize to anyone who can offer a better formulation of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special trustees would provide a separate administrative focus for the funds. I appreciate that it is difficult for health authorities or NHS hospital trusts to give appropriate attention to the 1 per cent. or 2 per cent. of total assets that they derive from charity rather than from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1217</span>
public NHS funding. Some communality of membership between the two organisations is desirable. I imagaine that some trustees would be shared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would provide separate accountability for the charitable funds. The report that I mentioned earlier suggests that there may be as many as 40,000 separate funds, which, technically, are all separate charities. That amounts to about one quarter of all registered charities. As the report shows, they are not always well-regulated or punctilious in filing their returns or in publishing their accounts separately from NHS income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend suggesting that there should be an amalgamation of the different funds and that the special trustees should control them? Under the much stricter interpretation of the duties of a charitable trustee, which is now rightly being enforced, it would be difficult to find sufficient good trustees to run the funds individually.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an excellent point. He and I developed, in other contexts, the idea of a rationalisation—though that is a dreaded word—of charitable activities. In any context, it is important not to muddy the springs of generosity with an insistent bureaucratic input. Nevertheless, individual charitable funds could be held under an umbrella organisation of special trustees, who would have an opportunity to tidy up the trusts' activities to allow a more effective use of funds and provide a better service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than formally moving the new clause and hurriedly continuing, I chose to introduce my idea in debate, because, apart from the fact that the Committee was owed an explanation, I hoped that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would consider not just the narrow issue of NHS trusts but the wider issue of how the charitable sector and the generosity of patients and their relatives should be best used in the service. Some of those points would bear scrutiny in future. There should be a separate administrative focus, better and separate accountability, and the funds should be better used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report also contains disturbing evidence that funds are not always used to good effect. In the context of charitable activities, sins of omission are as bad as sins of commission, and as frequent. Millions of pounds are tied up in dormant or dead trusts. Nobody has looked into that matter, and other trusts are simply piling up accumulated income in a way that could attract public criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to get a better focus on the issue, I shall refer to sins of commission—things that go wrong because the administrative structure is not well-founded. Fraud is not a common problem among charitable trusts, but I remind the Committee that it is a breach of charitable law to apply charitable funds to the fulfilment of a statutory duty. All hon. Members want money to be raised for scanners, major new projects or staff and patient welfare, but trust funds should not be used to subsidise low-quality services. That is another reason for keeping the administration separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department should also consider an unfortunate, and still irritant interface between the NHS and the charitable sector. The NHS can put out NHS funds for appeals, but it would be improper for the charitable sector to use public money for appeals. We legislated for that in the early 1980s. There is not yet a level playing field, and I hope that we do not make it more difficult than necessary for charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1218</span>
This complex new clause would provide opportunities, on an individual basis, for trustees to look after the charitable trusts that have been given to the NHS to support its activities, to ensure that trusts are properly and separately accounted for, and, by extension, that they are used to best effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A complex set of related issues arises out of the report, which I hope that my hon. Friends will consider in detail. The report has highlighted the fact that there are large sums which must be used properly in patients' interests and in the interests of the NHS. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State will agree that the new clause would fulfil an important role in allowing for the effective management of trust funds by the NHS trusts. I hope that it would allow the substantial sums to continue to be available for the benefit of patients. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to commend amendments Nos. 811 and 812, which would have the same effect in Scotland. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, they would ensure that the NHS management changes proposed in the Bill did not affect the availability of trust funds to hospitals or other units that they were intended for and that such units continued to benefit from such funds whether they remained directly managed or became NHS trusts. The new clause would do that by providing for the transfer of trust funds to or from NHS trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, his new clause would provide for arrangements to be made for the appointment of new trustees, and for the organisation of trust funds to take account of developing circumstances to the benefit of patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart that my hon.

As the Committee would expect, my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has done his homework in constructing his amendments and they are in a form in which I can commend them to the Committee without anxiety about their technical viability.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee who were at dinner together the other evening will remember that the Secretary of State drew attention to the two amendments to schedule 7 in my name which relate to the pharmaceutical service and industry. He also drew attention to the fact that my amendments applied to Scotland. After the splendid reception for my previous amendments, I am almost certain that I shall be told that there is something wrong with these two amendments and that they are not technically correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would do what the pharmaceutical industry has asked us to do, which is to define by regulations what pharmaceutical services are and what pharmaceutical services may be provided in a given area. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will realise that I am being brief because it is in the interests of the Committee. I look foward to hearing what he has to say about my amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1220</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has been extremely brief, especially about the Scottish part of the Bill and the omission of any similar amendments in the part of the Bill that involves England and Wales. I hope that I shall not be out of order if, in referring to my hon. Friend's amendment, I show that it has wider implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pharmacists want to be more involved in health care, and indeed, they increasingly are. Doctors welcome that, because it eases their load. I do not need to quote from the Nuffield report to a Committee as knowledgeable as this. There are about 11,000 pharmacies in the country, and it is estimated that 6 million visits are made to them every day. Pharmacists are in greater contact with the general public than are GPs. Pharmacists give advice to customers. We have all been to chemists and consulted them on coughs and colds, our painful muscles and other ailments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pharmacists also give advice to doctors on prescribing. They play a part in health education by distributing leaflets on health care and related issues. I am involved with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and I know how grateful it has been to pharmacists for distributing literature on child abuse. There is ample scope for pharmacists to be involved in practical health care—not simply removing the speck from one's eye, but carrying out basic health tests. They can keep records of long-term medication, particularly for the elderly, visit people in their homes, again, especially the elderly, and go to residential homes and give advice on medication and the storage of medicines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, pharmacists are remunerated for the supply of medicines and appliances but for nothing else, and unless some change is made in the Bill, unsatisfactory restrictions will remain in Scotland, England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nuffield report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The deficiencies of the present remuneration system are so manifest and so damaging that the staff, on its reform, should be treated as a matter of urgency."</p></blockquote>
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North affect Scotland. The relevant clause in the Bill, with regard to England and Wales, is clause 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the ministerial noises to which my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North referred and the recent reply from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, it seems that the Government are not unsympathetic to the point being made but are uncertain whether they could find the legislative opportunity to make the necessary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes are not controversial, and the Bill would be an ideal opportunity to put the matter right, not by defining precisely the pharmaceutical services for which remuneration could be made, but simply by loosening the restrictions and perhaps giving the Secretary of State regulation-making powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can accept the amendments, if not in the letter, then at least in the spirit of the amendments. If he can, perhaps he could use his influence to introduce similar amendments at a later stage to cover England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Worthington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) was muttering into his beard that the amendments had been drafted by the Department. I can claim no credit at all for them.

I am happy to accept the amendments in principle, but I cannot accept them today, and I undertake to bring back some amendments on Report which meet the purpose required in respect of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon.

Friend's amendment will be able, subject to regulations being made by the Secretary of State, to receive remuneration for providing a wider range of services. It would be quite wrong, of course to limit the benefit to one part of the United Kingdom, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has said that he will table similar amendments on Report which will provide for it to apply in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw his amendments and that my hon.

Those activities, I understand, have long been provided to foreign Governments on a reimbursement basis, as they are being provided now.

Is it just words on paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISABLED PERSONS (CARE OR ASSISTANCE SERVICES)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 29(6) of the National Assistance Act 1948, a local authority shall be authorised to make payments to a disabled person for the purchase of care or personal assistance services.'.—	<i>[Mr Rowe.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time. I understand from private conversation that the new clause 3 may be deemed unnecessary, but I have no qualms about having tabled it because it contains a fundamentally important principle. There is doubt about whether local authorities are legally allowed to provide money to disabled people to make their own arrangements for care. Local authorities in Hampshire, Somerset and Tower Hamlets, to name but three, already make such arrangements but other authorities continue to complain that they do not have the legal power to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, a case is being considered by the ombudsman in Humberside of a local authority that has chosen not to make this provision without necessarily arguing about whether it has legal power to do so. The Humberside Committee refused to consider the matter further by saying that it would create a precedent and require a change of policy. If we believe that the consumer voice in the provision of community care should be if not paramount then of supreme importance, it must be right to enable disabled people to take control of their care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisation representing the disabled—the Spinal Injuries Association taking the lead—have provided me with useful material from which I shall quote briefly to illustrate my argument. One severely disabled person writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I currently receive approximately £15,000 per annum to employ and administer the personal assistance I require. This money is not deemed to be taxable as income.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Direct funding to individual disabled people as a means of meeting their personal assistance needs to enable them to lead independent lives in the community, is a viable and proven solution. It is a choice that should be open to all the severely disabled people. It enables individuals to take full and active participation in life as equal citizens with the opportunities and responsibilities that go along with that.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is cost effective however it is measured and it empowers disabled people to take control of their own lives, where this might otherwise not be possible."</p></blockquote>
Although new clause 3 is confined to the disabled, I earnestly hope that over the years we shall see the development of a wide range of opportunities for these consumers to enable them to buy, with public funds, the care that they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1224</span>
It must be true, because examples abound, that individuals often know best what physical aid they need. Despite this, occupational therapists and others provide inappropriate aid which rots on the stem, at great disadvantage to the public purse and the individually disabled, It must also be true that some families will willingly contribute £200 or so to ensure that the necessary aid is available in addition to money that might be spent on the inappropriate aid that is all that the local social services department can provide. This sort of topping-up is possible only if it is accepted in principle that money should be paid to the disabled person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is not exactly central to my argument but it gives me an opportunity to mention one issue to my hon. Friend the Minister for Health which I hope she will take seriously. Among the assistance available to disabled people is assistance from people who themselves receive invalidity benefit. There has been a disturbing development whereby benefit offices claim that if a person is well enough to be able to offer assistance to others, he should not receive invalidity benefit. That is wrong. Volunteers can often choose the hours that they work, they are not subject to stress because they know that they can withdraw if they have to, and in many instances it is the best way for a person in receipt of invalidity benefit to get back to no longer needing it. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will think carefully about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to make it clear beyond doubt that no local authority may use as an excuse for not providing direct financial assistance to the disabled a legal mumbo jumbo that suggests the illegality of the idea. If my hon. Friend the Minister can assure me that that message will go out loud and clear to local authorities, my new clause may be unecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am watching the clock, and it may be necessary for me to continue my remarks later. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) has done the Committee a great service. The new clause enables discussion of possible ways of discussing community care for disabled people without taking on board the financial difficulties that many of them experience. Inevitably those difficulties will be greater than those for the non-disabled because of the extra demands to arrange care and aid, including diet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Committee to think about the aims of DIG, the Disablement Income Group. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent knows that its objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
