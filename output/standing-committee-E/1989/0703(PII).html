	<p>xxx.—REGISTRATION OF CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES</p>
	<p>(1) Any person who supplies labour or services for reward to another MAY IN ACCORDANCE with the provisions herein described at subsections (2) (3) and (4) register a memorandum of Contract for Services Agreement.</p>
	<p>(2) A Memorandum of Contract for Services Agreement shall be brought about in the following manner. A form SE obtainable from the Department of Employment shall be duly completed and signed by the parties to be charged therewith. Upon signature and on or before the date shown upon the memorandum the supplier of service or labour shall cause to be sent, either by recorded Delivery or Registered Post, authorised copies of the said memorandum to the Inspector of Taxes exercising jurisdiction over the income of the supplier that will arise as a result of the provision of such labour or services, and also authorised copies of the said memorandum to that office of the Department of Social Security which administers Class 2 and 4 National Insurance contributions in respect of the supplier of such labour or services.</p>
	<p>(3) A Memorandum of Contract for Services Agreement, shall state the name and address of both the supplier of labour or services and the person or party to whom they are supplied. The Memorandum shall state a brief description of the labour or services to be granted therefore. The issue of one Memorandum shall not preclude the issue of several other simultaneous or subsequent memoranda.</p>
	<p>(4) Any material change, variation, amendment or extension to the registered contract for services that may arise during its period of performance shall be endorsed on the Memorandum of Contract for Services Agreement, initialled and dated by the parties to be charged therewith, and on or before the date of such amendment copies of the same shall be sent to the parties above-mentioned in subsection (2) hereof.</p>
	<p>(5) No person shall be subject to tax under Schedule E of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 (or any Act repealing the said Act), nor shall any person be liable to make National Insurance contributions (either as a primary or secondary contributor under Class 1 National Insurance contributions, in accordance with the provisions of the Social Security Act 1973, nor shall any person be entitled to be treated as an "employee" nor as working under a "contract of service" for any purpose whatsoever, where the registration of a Memorandum of Contract for Services Agreement has been duly undertaken in accordance with the provisions of this Act, except in the following circumstances.</p>
	<p>(6) Notwithstanding the appropriate registration of a memorandum (or any amendment thereto) in accordance with the provisions of this Act, an Inspector of Taxes, or the Secretary of State for Social Security, may (provided subsection (7) applies) cause an inquiry to be instituted by either the General Commissioners for the Inland Revenue, or a duly appointed Inspector acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Social Security, as the case may be, for the purpose of determining whether the parties ought to be treated as bound by a contract of employment, or whether the supplier of labour or services ought to be otherwise taxable under Schedule E of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, or whether the parties ought otherwise be liable to make (primary and secondary) contributions under Class 1 in accordance with the provisions of the Social Security Act 1973.</p>
	<p>(7) No enquiry shall be instituted under subsection (6) above, or at all, unless the parties have been given written notice of the intention to institute such an inquiry, within SUE calendar months of the date of registration of a memorandum of Contract for Services Agreement (or any variation thereto).</p>
	<p>(8) In any such inquiry that arises by virtue of subsections (6) or (7) above, the existence of a duly registered memorandum (or any variation etc, thereto) shall be conclusive evidence that the parties are bound by a contract for services, unless or until the inquiring tribunal is reasonably satisfied that there is admissible evidence of at least five or more of the following factors:

	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
	<ol>
	<li>that there is a mutual and continuing contractual obligation on the parties to provide work and the provision of labour and services, that arises outside of and not by virtue of the written terms of the memorandum of contract for services.</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services is entitled to holiday or sick pay or maternity leave.</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services is entitled to be reimbursed his authorised "out of pocket" expenses by the hirer of such labour or services.</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services is not in business on his own account and works wholly under the direction and control of the hirer of labour or services.</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services provides the name to only one hirer of the same in the course of any year in which his income tax falls to be assessed or his national insurance contributions are required to be regulated.</li>
	<li>that the contract makes provision for termination by notice</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services invested only such labour and services in the hirer's undertaking, and did not otherwise stand to gain or lose from the undertaking organised by the hirer of such labour or services.</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services is entitled to benefit from any staff consultative procedures organised by the hirer or labour or services,</li>
	<li>that the contract makers provision for a pension to be granted to the supplier of labour or services.</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services receives clothing or tools under the contract.</li>
	<li>that the supplier of labour or services is contractually restrained from working for others during the currency of the contract.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(9) Nothing in this Act shall require a tribunal to determine that a contract of employment exists, even where satisfied that five or more grounds exist amongst those specified in subsection (8) above, but if so satisfied, a tribunal shall determine the proper contractual status of the parties according to the principles of law which would have applied but for the existence of this Act.</p>
	<p>(10) Any finding of a tribunal instituted under this Act shall be subject to appeal or judicial review, on a matter of law to the Court of Appeal or the High Court as the case may be, and thence to the House of Lords, with leave either of that House or the Court of Appeal. An appeal shall likewise lie on a mixed question of fact and law in any case where the appellate court considers that an inferior tribunal has given an inappropriate amount of weight to any criteria which the tribunal has used in determining that contractual status of the parties.</p>
	<p>(11) Any finding by any tribunal which becomes a final determination of the contractual status of the parties shall not have retrospective effect to the date of such finding unless the court of tribunal orders otherwise on the grounds that the parties, or either of them have acted in bad faith, and then only in respect of that party so acting.'.—[Mr. Watts.]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Watts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Slough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause seeks to resolve a serious dilemma for the Government. One of the major successes of Government policy over the past 11 years has been the substantial growth of self-employment. It is one of the Government's major triumphs. Curiously, however, the Inland Revenue seems to be pulling in the opposite direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated actors' problems of reclassification from schedule D to E earlier. Sadly, actors are only one profession among many that have been recategorised. Without amending the law, a long line of professions will be similarly recategorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue's instinct is to treat everyone as an employee to be taxed under schedule E. There may be an element of thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, notwithstanding the disadvantages of self-employed status in terms of lack of security and of entitlement to unemployment benefit. However, we saw in the case of actors that that is not necessarily the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 53 is lengthy. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will be glad to hear that I do not intend to read through it. It is a lengthy means of achieving a
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
fairly simple and necessary end. It provides the means of establishing self-employed status. A supplier of labour or services for reward may register a contract for sevices agreement with the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security. Such registration would entitle the supplier to be treated as self-employed, be taxed under schedule D, and pay class 2 and class 4 national insurance contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were merely a matter of self-determination, such a scheme would be open to abuse. A major part of the new clause therefore makes provision within six months of registration for an inspector of taxes to cause an inquiry to be conducted by the general commissioners, and for the Secretary of State for Social Security to appoint an inspector to consider the appropriate tax schedules and classes of national insurance contributions to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand, there is a fairly simple mechanism for the supplier of services or labour to make his claim to be self-employed. On the other hand, the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security have the right to challenge claims that they consider ill founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (8) seeks to provide an objective test of self-employed status on the basis of 11 typical characteristics of employment. It requires the general commissioners to find that at least five of those characteristics have been satisfied before they can conclude that the person has the appropriate status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
The new clause would provide the means for a self-employed person to establish his status without being subject to a capricious decision by a tax inspector who is taxed under schedule E. It would also establish an objective basis for the general commissioners to determine, on an application by the Inland Revenue, whether the claim for self-employed status is valid. Such a procedure would be beneficial to the further growth of self-employment which has already made such a major contribution to the revitalisation of the British economy. It can continue to make a major contribution to the further development of the economy if the obstacles to self-employment are removed by measures such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:This new clause is as broad as it is long—and it is very long, and even broader when one examines it in detail. The notion that self-employed people should be subject to the tax regime in question by what amounts to self-certification, however attractive to the would-be self-employed, cannot be viewed with equanimity by anyone concerned about the smooth administration of the Inland Revenue and the proper collection of tax. The hon. Member for Slough (Mr. Watts) must know that the examination of a single tax return already costs about £12. Under the new clause, an inquiry would go out from the commissioner and all the relevant issues would be laid before the Inland Revenue before a decision was made as to whether the schedule was appropriate. The cost of that process would be enormous and it would be an unconscionable burden on the administrative system and on the ordinary taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obviously important that those who should properly be taxed under schedule D are so taxed and that those who find themselves taxed under schedule E and believe that they are wrongly so taxed should have the means of remedying that. But they have the remedy under the existing law, and to engage in a long, cumbersome and extremely costly process to bring about the desired effect would be unjustified. It would provide too many loopholes to be exploited by unscrupulous employers who might benefit from schedule D, rather than schedule E, applying. We cannot support the measure: we oppose it because we believe it to be unwarranted and wide open to abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I must apologise to you, Mr. Cormack, and the rest of the Committee for the fact that I began to participate in the debate while I was still at the bottom of the stairs where I heard the opening remarks. None the less, I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Mr. Watts) said about the new clause. I share his respect for the self-employed and his desire to encourage and assist self-employment. However, I diverge from him in two respects. First, I restrict my remarks to genuine self-employment and would not wish to encourage bogus self-employment, which might be the accidental consequence of his proposals. Secondly, I cannot go along with the slurs that he cast—unwittingly, perhaps—on the Revenue. The Revenue simply carries out the laws that the House, and to a large extent this Committee, entrusts it to enforce and if we do not like the consequence of laws that we pass, the solution is in our hands and our hands alone. We should not blame those whom e employ to enforce those laws for enforcing them diligently. The suggestion that the Revenue has been winnowing out the self-employed is
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
manifestly false. If it has been trying to do so, it has been singularly unsuccessful, as the number of self-employed has increased by no less than 60 per cent during the Government's life and it is still raising strongly. I believe that about 3 million people now work in a self-employed capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's ingenious proposal does not go as far as self-certification or the simple option to describe oneself as self-employed if one wishes. I discussed that theoretical option in an earlier debate. However, the new clause goes a long way in that direction and far enough to mean that people will have considerable scope to define themselves, at least for the time being, as self-employed and so escape taxation until the Inland Revenue catches up with them through the second disadvantage of the proposal, which is a bureacratic and complex procedure that requires the commissioners to assume proof on various criteria. We might end up with a more regulatory approach than that with which we started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present system, in the first instance, the employer has to decide whether those with whom he has engagements are self-employed persons at arm's length. That works well in 95 cases out of 100, although inevitably difficulties arise. However, it is better for the employer to take that initial decision in respect of the self-employed than waiting for bureaucratic machinery to respond if the initial option is given to the employee to decide whether he is an employee or is self-employed. So, although I agree with the objectives of my hon. Friend the Member for Slough, I advise the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In that brief debate the Labour party has demonstrated its traditional hostility to the self-employed. The elevation of concern for administrative convenience above everything else has been shown to be the Labour party's priority. By contrast, my hon. Friend the Minister has exhibited enthusiasm and support for the growth of the self-employed, which I share. Like him, I do not wish to provide a mechanism for those who might bogusly claim self-employed status to have the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my hon. Friend's remarks as a sign that he is willing to think about a means—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would wait until the bells have finished. No one can hear him and it would be a pity to miss his pearls of wisdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall resume my speech at the point where I finished my attack on the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister said that the Inland Revenue, which I perhaps criticised, is there only to carry out the law. I suggested that the law should be amended so that the procedures that the Inland Revenue carries out could be more sympathetic to the self-employed. My hon. Friend exhibited an enthusiasm for the growth of self-employment and said that he wished to ensure that life would not be made unnecessarily difficult for those who are genuinely self-employed. Like my hon. Friend, I do not wish to provide a loophole for those who make bogus claims for self-employed status. I took the tenor of my hon. Friend's remarks to mean that he is willing to think again about ways in which the lot of the genuinely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
self-employed can be made easier. In that spirit, which is in marked contrast to that of the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>GIFTS TO HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"1. Section 24A of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (gifts to housing associations) shall be amended as follows.</p>
	<p>2. In subsection (3), the words 'subsections (2), (4) and (5)' shall have effect in place of 'subsections (2) to (5)'.".—[Mr. Tim Smith.]</p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause deals with the important matter of low-cost rural housing. In the Finance Act 1989, section 24A was introduced into the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, extending the exemption to charities already given in that Act to registered housing associations to enable them to provide low-cost housing in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has an important social objective. As a result of changes made last year, landowners are not liable to tax if they give the freehold to housing associations. However, uncertainties exist if they provide housing associations with a long lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members ask why the landowners would want to do that, and why they do not give up the entire interest in the land. The answer is that often it will be convenient to preserve the character of the use of the land and to have a long lease—say, 999 years. To all intents and purposes that is no different from a freehold but has the advantage of being able to incorporate more easily, or to facilitate the incorporation of restricted covenants, which will ensure that the land is held for the use for which it is designated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are uncertainties over the matter, and these need to be resolved if we are to succeed in developing a series of low-cost projects on cheap land. The new clause seeks modestly to make a small extension to the valuable change introduced last year, so that long leaseholds can also be transferred to registered housing associations without the impact of inheritance tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am glad to be able to tell the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) that we are happy to support the proposal. We believe that it is sensible, prudent and modest. We are somewhat concerned about the context in which it is being introduced, in terms of the current difficulties faced by housing associations in relation to the provision of low-cost accommodation in rural areas, and indeed in urban areas. Those difficulties are as a result of the Government's failure to address the repeated call both from the newly appointed chairman of the Housing Corporation—who is anxious to see the constituency of housing associations grow, as, supposedly, are the Government—and from the National Federation of Housing Associations. The association has pointed out that unless further funds are forthcoming and the £400 million set aside for the next financial year brought forward so that it can be used in this financial
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
year, there is a danger that there will have to be a complete moratorium of between six and nine months on new housing provision in rural and urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tragedy is that unless the cash is forthcoming there will be no cash available for housing programmes during that period. The opportunity provided by the decline in the market for private house purchase for housing associations to come into the market and take up the slack—to the benefit of those who currently seek to sell houses, and those who are looking for low-cost housing in rural and urban areas provided by housing associations—will be lost. Therefore, we hope that the Minister will set the new clause within the context of the wider need for enhanced financial provision for housing associations, and show that the call from the housing association movement for those moneys to be brought forward has been heeded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I support my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) on this important matter. I should like to ask my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary if he recalls a meeting at the Treasury on 28 March with my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Trotter) and some others. Having heard all the arguments at that meeting, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary agreed to consider the matter further. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has said, there is no real difference between a lease of 999 years and a freehold, except that the availability of enforceable covenants enables many housing associations to allow their houses to go to the people whom they consider more desirable, or more deserving of benefit. I believe that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary asked my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth and his fellow visitors whether that was a real problem in practice. He was told that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. In Sutton Hastoe, the housing association wanted to establish a covenant to build and maintain six houses. The housing association is a registered charity, and the covenant was designed to ensure that, as far as possible, the houses would be occupied by people who have connections with but who could not otherwise afford to live in the nearby village of Whitelackington or neighbouring parishes. Preference would be given to young people and to people brought up in those parishes. In addition, the covenant would give preference to people nominated by the Whitelackington parish council, and would include a requirement to let the houses on an assured tenancies or community leasehold basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend intend to allow further consideration of this matter? He may fear that charities may take advantage of such an arrangement, but I remind him that the Government have so benefited charities in the past few years that this would be small fry in comparison. Moreover, many housing associations are charities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Wales and the west of England. The schemes affected by new clause 61, under which rural housing is provided on a non-profit basis because a landowner has made land available to a housing association at a nominal or much reduced price, can play a small but useful part in dealing with it. In my constituency, discussions are being held about land owned by Lord Armstrong and by the Duke of Northumberland. Those discussions are proof of the genuine attempts to use the provisions that the Government helpfully included in a previous Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Technicalities of taxation mean that the job is not quite complete. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was right to point out that the inheritance tax remains anomalous. I support the hon. Member strongly in this matter, and hope that the Government realise that this is a useful provision. They introduced it, and should make it as effective as possible so that it can help to solve the difficult rural housing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure that you, Mr. Cormack, unlike other hon. Members, have never imagined that Treasury Ministers invented the theory that if one gives an inch, people take a mile, and that if one makes a concession, there is constant pressure to widen it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause illustrates that process. For a long time, satisfactory and welcome relief was available to charities on outright gifts of land. Many representations were made to the Government and, last year, we extended that relief to non-charitable housing associations, on the same terms as it was available to charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pressure has been exerted to extend the relief further on gifts to housing associations—an advantage that is not available to charities, with which the original comparison was made. Many reasons have been given for that. They all suggest that housing associations cannot be trusted to use land in the way intended by the donor. Therefore, the giver must retains some powers over the land in addition to those exercised by the housing association, and a donor should be allowed to give a lease or some other interest in land as well as outright gifts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That alternative has not been permitted to charities because it opens up the possibility of abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following simple example illustrates the sort of avoidance that section 23(3) prevents and that the new clause could open up. A gives to Charity B, a charity that he has established, a lease of some land while giving the freehold reversion immediately or shortly afterwards to his son. The combined value of the two parts would be substantially less than the whole. Without the anti-avoidance provisions, there would be no inheritance claim on the transfer of the lease to the charity. Generally, there would be no claim when the lease expired or the charity "sold" it back to the son, enabling him to merge the two interests and to benefit from their full value. The considerable tax advantage of using that artificial device could be greater than if A simply transferred outright to his son his original freehold interest in the land. The Committee would not wish to open up the possibility of such tax avoidance devices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary to persuade landowners to give land to housing associations by going beyond the provisons made in last year's Finance Bill. I have considered the matter carefully since the meeting referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Han-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am disappointed by the Minister's reply, which shows no knowledge of landowning practices in rural areas. It is part of the fabric of rural life that landowners retain, for many generations, leasehold interests in buildings that are used for charitable and public purposes. In my constituency, schools chapels and other buildings are held on leasehold terms at peppercorn rents because of the actions of landowners in the past. Landowners believe that if, at anytime—even a century hence—the land ceases to be used for charitable purposes, their interest can be resumed. To interpret the new clause as a method of blatant tax evasion is to misunderstand the problem and the disincentive that exists to someone who faces a tax bill on £50,000 for a consideration of £10,000 or a smaller, nominal amount which is received for the lease. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield should think, further about how we can pursue the matter. Instead of finding ways to make the clause watertight against abuses, Ministers are damaging a valuable initiative, and failing to recognise that they are so doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the clause is long and apparently complicated, I shall try to go through it as briefly as possible in the spirit of this evening's proceedings. It is common ground in the Committee that the concept of employee share ownership should be encouraged. In the interest of brevity, I shall not go back to the establishment of employee profit sharing schemes through the Lib-Lab pact, but it is to the Government's credit that they have sought to build on that initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In last year's Finance Act, efforts were made to establish statutory employee share ownership trusts. They differed from previous trusts because the courts determined whether they qualified for corporation tax relief. When the Government promoted statutory employee share ownership plans last year, they established a set of criteria. If donations by companies to trusts met those criteria companies were automatically eligible for tax relief. A recent article is the Law Society's Gazette said that that measure converted a possiblity of tax relief into a certainty. The measure was introduced with the best intentions, but unfortunately they have not been fulfilled. Since the measure was put on to the statute book, no statutory ESOP has been created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would remove some of the restrictive conditions attached last year to the creation of statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
ESOPs and is a challenge to the Minister that he should be prepared to accept. The new clause would make it easier for companies to create ESOPs. Subsection (1) would delete the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"resident in the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
The purpose is to ensure that employees of companies of Nissan UK, Ford Motor Company and IBM United Kingdom are entitled to share in the benefits of ESOPs, which is not possible now because of the wording of the Finance Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause will cover a large number of employees, as it is wrong in principle to deny them the benefits that other employees in the United Kingdom are able to enjoy. If the Financial Secretary is not prepared to accept the new clause, he should provide us with some rationale as to why these employees should be denied the benefit of participation in employee share ownership plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (2) deals with two possible circumstances relating to the trustees of an employee share ownership trust. The first is set out in new subparagraph (2B) of schedule 5 to the Finance Act 1989, which provides for a corporate trust that would be the subsidiary of the company that funds the ESOP. The purpose is to remove one of the hinderances preventing people, especially employees, from putting themselves forward as trustees. The consequence of failure is personal liability, but I envisage having corporate, rather than individual, liability. Provisions for the number of directors and their qualifications reflect the Government's regulations in schedule 5 of the Finance Act 1989 for appointing trustees. The other possibility for dealing with trustees appears in paragraph (3). We seek to set out the minimum requirement for ensuring fiscal responsibility. With regard to the next—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was coming on to the next paragraph. If the hon. Gentleman had not asked me to carry on, I would have moved on to paragraph (4), as I have already covered paragraph (3). Paragraph (4) follows on logically, technically tidying up the consequences of what has preceded it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (5) would change the provisions about who may benefit from an ESOP. It would allow those who worked for 16 rather than 20 hours a week to benefit. We could argue about the figures, but it would help those who are in part-time employment by making it possible for them to benefit. People who have been working in an enterprise for less than one year should also have the opportunity to benefit from ESOPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall elaborate. Paragraph (5) removes a disjunction between the mandatory terms of qualifying employees under this scheme and those who may qualify under an approved profit-sharing scheme, which ESOPs are designed to serve. At present, employees with less than one year's service are excluded from the scheme, but they can still benefit from an approved profit-sharing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
scheme trust. The disparity is anomalous. Paragraph (5) would remove that anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (6) and (2) are intended to ensure that the qualifying employee share ownership trust serves all three of existing share ownership schemes. The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) has already mentioned them—the 1978 profit sharing scheme, the 1980 savings-related scheme, and the most recent one for higher paid employees and executives. The new clause puts them all on the same level. If the Government are convinced that those three schemes are worth supporting, I hope that they will accept that we are trying to put ESOPs on a similar basis so that there are no disparities and they all operate in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Government tried to do last year was valid and laudable, but as the Law Society's Gazette of 7 March 1990 stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the government really does believe that ESOPs will be the engine room of growth in employee share ownership during the 1990s, there is a lot more work to be done in the Finance Act 1990."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that the rollover relief on capital gains tax will, in itself, be enough. The proposal would liberalise the present restrictions on ESOPs. Even if the Financial Secretary cannot accept every point that I have mentioned, I hope that he will accept some of them and that, as a result, ESOPs will take off during 1990–91 to a greater extent than they did in 1989–90</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:During last year's consideration of the Finance Bill, debates on ESOPs proceeded in a bipartisan way between the main political parties—the Conservatives and Labour parties—as, indeed, has been the case this year.

I do not wish to criticise the selection of new clauses for debate, but shall simply say that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) has not raised a single point that has not already been debated in the passage of this year's Finance Bill.

He is correct that many of these issues have been discussed at considerable length both this year and in previous years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one area in which I detect from my analysis of the points raised in the new clause, a marked and singular change in the Liberal party's position. It seeks to knock away the central purpose of ESOPs which was to transfer a measure of ownership—and, with it, control—to workers and employees of the company. The new clause would alter the trustee requirements so that it does not, in the words of one of those who probably helped with the drafting of this aspect, provide the threat of worker control which might discourage the introduction of ESOPs. Trustees would not have to be elected by or selected from employees of the company. That would be a retrograde step and would render pointless the tax relief that we introduced to encourage the adoption of ESOPs, which genuinely help the full, equitable and speedy transfer of ownership to the employees of a company. I ask the Committee to reject the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) tempts me to go on at great length as he was rude about it earlier and, in replying to the Minister, I may succumb to that temptation. Clearly, the Minister believes that the purpose of Parliament and of Committees is to allow the Labour and Conservative parties to enjoy a nice duopoly of the time, the rhetoric and the rubbish that he sometimes emits. He takes it badly when another party puts forward constructive suggestions. They have been heard before, but if they need repeating, they must have been answered inadequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an experienced parliamentarian, Mr. Cormack, you must have heard the same points time and time again. When I last served on a Finance Bill Committee, I tabled an amendment on employee participation which the Liberal party had tabled in 1975 and which the Chief Secretary to the Treasury was persuaded to approve, although he was unwilling to support it then. That we bring back the same points does not mean that they are less correct or proper. On the contrary, we are more and more committed to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Financial Secretary did not give a better response than his one small carping point, which showed clearly that he was reading from his brief and had not listened to me when I moved the new clause. I said that the number of employees required as trustees was being reduced because of the fear of personal liability, which is a disincentive. That is why the new clause proposes the possibility of a corporate trustee, one of whose directors must be an employee of the company. I should have preferred the majority of the directors to be employees of the company, but we drafted the new clause in a form that we thought that the Government would find more acceptable. We thought that that was a worthwhile effort to try to get part of the new clause accepted.

Unfortunately, any measure to get ESOPs off the ground that sounds at all radical is anathema to the Government. Their proposal last year, with all the restrictions, has resulted in no statutory ESOPs. That is the measure of their success. The Financial Secretary's rhetoric about using that as a way to increase employee participation is not borne out by experience. There is not one example of that happening in practice. By relaxing some restrictions, ESOPs should be given a chance to succeed. That was the Government's intention last year. It is regrettable that they are unprepared to carry through that intention by accepting our new clause this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause relates to a matter that was raised, but not satisfactorily resolved under last year's Finance Bill—the taxation of redundancy payments to people engaged in the public service, particularly to employees of local authorities. There is a tax exemption on redundancy payment lump sums up to £30,000 which does not apply if those sums are paid in a periodical form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In last year's Finance Bill debates, the Financial Secretary, who was then, if I remember rightly, the Economic Secretary, answered my argument by saying:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is possible for an employer to pay out £30,000 as a lump sum, tax free, if he wishes to do so, or if his employees and their negotiators persuade him to do so. 	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee</i> G, 27 June 1989; c. 690]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
He has since confirmed in a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) what was clear to us then: that local authorities, technical colleges and other local authority places of education do not have such an option because statutory instruments or the Department of the Environment preclude them from ensuring that when their employees receive redundancy payments they get the benefit of relief. In his letter of 19 September 1989 to my hon. Friend, the Minister referred to statutory instrument 1009/82 which
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provides that redundancy…payments should take the form of periodical payments which…means that they do not qualify for the£30,000 exemption."</p></blockquote>
He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is a matter for the Department of the Environment of how they wish local authority employers to make redundancy compensation payments."</p></blockquote>
We know that the Department of the Environment insists that payments are not made in the way that ensures that employees obtain tax relief. As the Minister left the Committee with a far from complete understanding of the situation last year—or sought to give the impression that in some way the employer had discretion—he should recognise this year that local authority employees cannot persuade or negotiate with their employer to ensure that they obtain the benefit of tax relief. It is a discrimination against people in the public service who are made redundant and there seems no reasonable justification for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I accept that subsection (2) is apparently trying to close a loophole whereby payments that would otherwise be tax free are not.

Last year, the Minister sought to leave the Committee with the impression that there was no problem and that employers in the public sector could, if they chose and their employees pressed them to do so, make such payments in a form that would give tax relief.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of issues relating to new clauses 67–72 and to the trust ports were debated fully last night on the Floor of the House when we discussed the Ways and Means resolutions relating to the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been made clear that the trust ports are owned by the state and not by the Government and that it is for Parliament to decide on the distribution of the proceeds of the sale. There is an argument about what proportion should go to the Exchequer but the Government have made it clear from the start that in their view, only 50 per cent should do so—and that is 50 per cent as well as normal tax charges on the remainder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The six new clauses propose that a levy of 50 per cent should be chargeable on the proceeds of the sale of securities whenever a trust port is converted into a company by means of a private Act. The Government regard that as an equitable share of the proceeds between the Exchequer and the shareholders. In making that decision we took into account the initiative shown by both the Tees and Hartlepool and the Clyde port authorities, which have introduced their own pri</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
	<p>be reduced as nearly to nil as is permitted under subsection (3) below.".</p>
	<p>(c), in line 24, leave out "three" and insert "10".</p>
	<p>Government new clauses 70—	<i>Payment of levy</i>—</p>
	<p>Government new clause 71—	<i>Information for purpose of levy</i>—</p>
	<p>Government new clause 72—	<i>Supplementary provisions relating to levy</i>—</p>
	<p>vate Bills and have made clear their intention to go ahead. We also had to have in mind the interests of the taxpayer who has not made a large contribution but has nevertheless contributed something towards the development of the trust ports in the past. Furthermore, we had to have regard for equality of competition and to not giving the ports which are to be privatised any commercial advantage through an overlarge cash injection.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the right hon. Gentleman sought to get a rough idea of the relationship between moneys contributed by the Exchequer in the past and the level of charge to be imposed by this tax, what advice was he given? Was it a relationship of 1:10,1:100, or 1:1,000? In what way does the money put in by the Exchequer in the past to trust ports compare with the level of charge to be imposed on the ports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I made clear in a few brief sentences, that was not the only factor and we are not attempting to equate the tax charge with the money invested in the past. There are three reasons for having a take: first, the money invested in the past; secondly, as I said, equality of competition; and thirdly, as I was about to say, the fact that the ports belong if to the Government to the state. The National Audit Office commented on the fact that in the case of the Trustee Savings Bank, whose ownership is analagous to those of the trust ports, it would have been open to the Government to have taken part of the proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that it is the Government's intention to secure 50 per cent of the proceeds from the privatisation of the Tees and Hartlepool ports authority and the Clyde port authority but also to apply the same regime to future privatisation. We have framed the new clauses on the basis of the legislation that has already been presented to the House. Other Bills may be presented in future and may seek to avoid the levy by various devices. If those Bills are in a different form
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
it will be open to the Government to take future action retrospectively and I give due warning that we intend there to be a 50 per cent levy and we will bear that in mind should there be attempts to alter the form of the legislation in a way that would make the levy redundant. We intend that there should be a levy of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that I have shocked the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). I am sorry to do that at this crucial hour but I do not think that there is anything very shocking in what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is much more like old times. Everybody else has gone home apart from the members of the Finance Bill Committee and some staff of the House who are compelled to stay. The Chief Secretary is back among us in his place—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And with his team.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, with his team: a full complement of supporters. We are pleased to see that he is here doing his old job—that of the Financial Secretary—and showing us all how it should be done. We welcome that as well. Last night, as the Chief Secretary has said, we debated these matters at some length on the floor of the House. Both the Financial Secretary and myself are sorry that the Chief Secretary was unable to join in our thorough examination of the issues. It is appropriate that we should end our deliberation on the Finance Bill by discussing the introduction of a brand new and rather peculiar new tax. It is ironic that it is being introduced by a Government who claim to be committed to reducing taxation and who boast about how many taxes they have abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New taxes must have a name, and when this one became known as the docks tax, the Liberals voted for oblivion. A more appropriate name for the tax—I am trying to help—the Chief Secretary with his hon. Friends on the Back Benches—would be the privatisation tax. We are being invited to agree a tax on trust ports that convert into limited companies by means of private Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new tax is the latest contribution to the Government's theories about popular capitalism. Was it triumphantly announced in the Chancellor's Budget speech? It was not. It is true that the Chancellor did not say, "Watch my lips: no new taxes", but neither did he talk about revenue enhancement. Nothing was said about this privatisation during the Budget debate nor during the Second Reading debate on the Finance Bill. The Opposition consider the Government's handling of the matter to be an abuse of the Finance Bill Committee procedures. The Finance Bill is a public Bill, not a ramp to facilitate the Government's view of the financial arrangements that should accompany private Bills, in any evident, we have our doubts about how private the trust port private Bills are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government felt that there was a genuine need to legislate for bodies to take over from the trust ports, why has not the Secretary of State for Transport pulled out his whatnot and tabled a public Bill? Instead, the Chief Secretary is using the Finance Bill as a device for washing that Secretary of State's soiled linen. The merits of private sector ownership over those of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
successor public authority should have been debated in the context of a Bill introduced by the Secretary of State for Transport, who heads the responsible Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main bone of contention between the Opposition and the Government is the status in society of the institution that is to control the bodies that are currently trust ports. The Labour party believes that those functions should remain in the public sector. If the votes on the Clyde Port Authority Bill last night are any guide, the Government believe that those functions should be transferred to the private sector. The Committee is being asked to approve a new tax to share out the privatisation proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary has argued, as unconvincingly as did the Financial Secretary last night, that somehow the state is not the Government and that something else is responsible for administering the state. I do not know what that something could be. It is not possible to divorce the affairs of the state from those of the Government, especially in commercial activities. The Government's attempt to do so is lame and feeble. There is considerable evidence that the Government are trying pretty hard to control the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, surely it is the Government who are selling the trust ports. Normally, if one sells something one keeps the money that one gets for it. It is not logical to say that, because the state owns the trust ports and the Government do not, only 50 per cent of the money should be kept. In fairness to the Chief Secretary, he has not said that it is logical. He has simply said that that is what the Government will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall draw an analogy with the Crown jewels. If the Government decided to sell them, they would probably argue that they belonged to the state and not the Government. I suppose that that is true. The Governmnent could sell them if they wanted to. If they decided to keep only 50 per cent of the proceeds, it would affect the sale price. The analogy stands true for trust ports. Of course the sale price of those ports will be affected by the taxation arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could also draw an analogy with a flotation of a successful private business on to the stock exchange. In those circumstances, the business would keep the capital that was raised. The Government would have no right to 50 per cent of the takings. That is the analogy that the port authorities, not unnaturally, are trying to persuade us is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whichever analogy is adopted, we are dealing either with the sale of state assets, in which case the Government should keep the proceeds, or with the flotation of a body whose present standing is indeterminate, in which case the new enterprise should keep the money raised by flotation. Nowhere can I see an argument that the money should be shared 50:50. To be fair, the Chief Secretary that the only way to resolve the ambiguity would be to take half each. The Government, as the Chief Secretary has confirmed, will take their 50 per cent. Of course, the Chief Secretary has the power to adjust that if he wants to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newly-privatised port limited companies would still be subject to capital gains tax and corporation tax liabilities. It is impossible to compute exactly how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
much that involves, as it would depend on arrangements for privatisation and how companies subsequently structured their affairs. The truth is that the choice of tax take is arbitrary and cannot be defended rationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Privatising our port authorities will not help regions of our country such as the Clyde or Tees and Hartlepool. There is substantial scope for raising money on the initial privatisation, and even more scope for raising it through property development immediately following privatisation. Supporters of privatisation often argue that trust ports are too inflexible and that succeeding authorities in the private sector will be more dynamic with the use of land. Supporters emphasise the scope for the redevelopment of land and the potential value of real estate no longer needed for port activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party takes the view that a successor authority could be created and operating agreements for trust ports could be extended or adjusted so to cover this function. We do not accept that the above argument is a justification for privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax treatment is initial. It will not be repeated year by year. Further profits accruing to the port authority from the disposal and development of land will be missed. The Tees and Hartlepool authorities have already boasted of their intentions. They intend to establish two separate companies: a main and a subsidiary company. The functions currently carried out by the port authorities will be discharged by the subsidiary company. It is clear that the main company will want to diversify abroad, to develop land that is currently surplus to port requirements and,' significantly, to work alongside the urban development corporations in the areas covered by the Tees and Hartlepool port authority and by other trust ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that I have his undivided and enthusiastic attention, I want to explore some matters of detail with the Chief Secretary. I am sure that he is relishing this as much as is the rest of the Committee. The tax to be charged on the gains made on transferring assets and good will to the successor company could be made on the transfer to that company—the gain being taxed on the harbour authority—or when the company left the harbour authority's tax group on privatisation under section 278 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. The capital gains base cost to the harbour authority of the shares in the successor company would be roughly equal to the proceeds received from them on privatisation. The Government surely do not envisage an automatic and useless capital loss to the harbour authorities, but perhaps the Chief Secretary could explain the accumulation of capital losses that cannot be used for tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more minor point, there seems to be no appeal procedure against the Secretary of State's assessment to levy. The Chief Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but I cannot find that in the Government new clauses. Government new clause 70 includes no such procedure. Do the Government intend there to be no appeal procedure? In the Committee discussing last year's Finance Bill, I remember a courageous and mov-
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
ing speech by the then Financial Secretary, now the Chief Secretary, for which the Opposition applauded him, about workers' involvement in industry and in employee share ownership trusts and about workers' control. He appeared to have moved from the position that we thought that he occupied and made what we considered to be a radical commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Financial Secretary has not taken those strong words with him to his new job as Chief Secretary. This measure would limit the shares that could be given to employees to a mere 3 per cent. I admit that that is an increase on the 1 per cent that an earlier draft of the clause proposed, but why should there be a limit of 3 percent? I do not understand why the Government want to discourage employee participation, unless they think that, given the vast sums that are at stake, anything more than that would be outside the financial abilities of the work force. Why not consider giving a larger share ownership in the form of an employee share ownership trust, or a similar vehicle, to which the Government claim to be committed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make my final point to Conservative Members. If they vote for the measure, they will be supporting a substantial tax on organisations that are currently in the public sector, albeit in a slightly unusual form, but that seek to privatise themselves. We oppose that move, but how many Back Bench Conservative Members are happy about a new clause that seeks to levy a one-off charge that misses the substantial gains that could accrue to port authorities in the future and is penal and unfair in the short-term?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I did not speak during last night's debate in the house because it would have been a slightly pointless exercise as we are discussing the new clauses today. It was interesting that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) claimed that the Labour party opposes privatisation of the ports. It is on record that the Transport and General Workers Union does not oppose it, or privatisation in general. That shows the dinosaur qualities of the Labour party, which persists in its antediluvian opposition to privatisation even when one of its traditional supporters favours it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I currently chair the Committee considering the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Bill. I have tabled amendments in relation to the Clyde Port Authority Bill, which received its Third reading last night. I drafted the amendments myself, with the assistance of our esteemed Clerk. I cannot pretend that I have wanted for advice since I tabled them, as almost everybody connected with the ports industry has beaten a path to my door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to trace a brief history of the trust ports' position, without going into how they came to be trust ports. When my right hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Channon) was Secretary of State for Transport, he encouraged trust ports to seek privatisation through the private Bill procedure. He did so because the trust ports do not belong to the Government. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said as much this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trust ports do not even belong to the state, although the National Audit Office has said that they do. If they did, they could not have been advised to use the private Bill procedure to privatise themselves. That would have been wholly inappropriate. Trust ports could not use the private Bill procedure if they belonged to the state. It is true that the Government have put money into the trust ports from time to time. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said, those investments vary in proportion and timing from port to port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the government cannot levy a special rate of tax on that which it does not own. No similar levy was made on the Associated British Ports privatisation, which represents a major competitor. I refer my right hon. friend to his point about equality of competition. Associated British Ports is a major player in the ports industry. If every trust port were priv-vatised tomorrow, they would not come anywhere near to equalling the competition represented by Associated British Ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Associated British Ports was privatised, the Government wrote off £81.3 million in debt. Similarly, they expressly excluded any liability to tax on the privatisation of the Trustee Savings bank. I believe that the proposed levy is also technically wrong because the new clause can give rise to 100 per cent levy. It could give rise to a levy on the proceeds raised by the equity
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
issue. For example, under the new clause as drafted, the new shareholders' funds are to be subject to the levy. It is beyond me why my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, who has many successful privatisations to his credit, should choose to penalise the new members of company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disadvantages of the new clause do not rest there. Because of the methodolgy proposed by the new clause, the transfer of assets is subject to corporation tax which, unlike capital gains tax, is not capable of indexation. I am certain that my right hon. Friend will say that the way in which the mechanism works will not result in double taxation, as the assets move from the trust port to the temporary trust to the corporate entity, but nowhere in the proposals do I find reassurance that that jeopardy can be avoided, should it arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the question of probity. The Clyde port authority has been encouraged to take the private Bill route—not an easy route by any stretch of the imagination. It has done its sums on the basis that the levy will be no more than 50 per cent. My hon. Friend the Minister for Aviation and Shipping, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. McLoughlin) told the House as much on 15 May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today is the first anniversary of the abolition of the dock labour scheme. Associated British Ports, in tonnage and traffic terms, has beaten the trust ports hands down in percentage growth since privatisation. If passed unamended, the new clauses will amount to a disincentive to privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an excellent article in today's 	<i>Employment Gazette</i> about the abolition of the dock labour scheme. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Though the study did not cover every port, the picture was the same at each port studied. All the managers and customers interviewed spoke of improved performance, morale and energy."</p></blockquote>
If these ports are put into the private sector, they will share that renewed energy and enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that the Government, who have set free the National Freight Consortium, British Airways, British Airports Authority, British Telecom and British Gas are seriously telling the Committee that the last brick on the chimney of privatisation of our ports industry in readiness for 1992 will be hobbled by a penal tax on privatising assets that no one owns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend wants to protect taxpayers' interests and to avoid the opprobrium of the National Audit Office, why will the Government not covenant the fixed assets with a development clause which would more accurately reflect my right hon. Friend's well-known zeal for privatisation? It would be less likely to slam shut forever the dockgates on the economic miracle that is just waiting to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) was right to commemorate the anniversary of the abolition of the dock labour scheme and to comment on how strange it is to introduce a tax on such a day. I do not share the Labour party's enthusiasm for the dock labour scheme or its disapproval of the privatisation of ports. I agree with the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
Isle of Wight that the proposals will deter many ports from taking a privatisation route or from making provision for privatisation to benefit their local community. Such provision would make them more readily acceptable to many people, including many local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new tax is a Teeside tax because only Teeside will be subject to it. The tax is on the assets created by people working on Teeside over many years. It is levied at a very high rate. It makes no sense and will act as a disincentive to those who wish to change the structure of trust ports to make better use of the land and more effectively to encourage the economic development of their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that the tax is a 50 per cent levy, but it is a 50 per cent levy on the market value if the market value is higher than the consideration given for the purchase of shares. That is a likely set of circumstances, especially if the port that is privatising takes steps to ensure that its ownership remains substantially in that locality by placing shares with local and regional institutions, local authorities and their pension funds and those who have a legitimate interest in the region and the area around the port. Any such measures will lead to the consideration being less than the market value, so the tax becomes more than 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) made it clear in the debate last night that he believes that the Government are making a serious mistake. He said that capital gains liabilities must be added to the liabilities of the 50 per cent levy. As the shareholders' money is added to the original value, as it was in the the Trustee Savings bank privatisation, there is the possibility of tax being levied on a market value far above the amount of money raised from the placing of shares, so it will be a tax at a substantially higher level. By that means the Government further discourage the involvement of the local community in the ownership and operation of the port in future. Advantageous terms for local communities would effectively be prohibited. The Government have made no provision for an alternative route that would assist the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's assumption is, "Here is some windfall money—let's tax it!" The natural instinct of Treasury Ministers it to tax money whenever they see it. They have found here what appears to them to be a windfall gain. The communities around the ports should benefit from that gain. A way to allow that would be to establish a commmon good fund, or local development fund, with trustees representing the local authorities, the local community, the port authority and development bodies working in the area, which could use some of the funds for developing the infrastructure on which the port depends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people who live around ports in those communities have to confront extra traffic, often on inadequate roads, and the extra pressure and disturbance that arise from a growing and successful port. Some of the proceeds could be used well to develop the port to the benefit of the port and the residents. "No, "say Treasury Ministers, "we want the money in national Treasury coffers." They produce no respectable, intellectual, moral, or political argument to justify that stance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
The Government have also pursued insufficiently the possibility of giving employees in ports an adequate entitlement to share ownership in the privatised ports. When the Government first tabled the new clause, the employee share ownership plan quotient—the proportion that they were prepared to make available for employee share ownership—was 1 per cent. That figure was increased to 3 per cent. Progress was made as somebody notice the inadeqauacy of the original figure. Why not have a larger figure? Our amendment (c) to Government new clause 69 proposes 10 per cent—on the Financial Secretary's authority. On 16 May, the Financial Secretary said about ESOPs:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think that 10 per cent strikes the right balance, representing as it does a stake large enough to ensure the employees a degree of involvement in the company's affairs".—[Official Report, 16 May 1990; Vol. 172. c.960.]</p></blockquote>
If 10 per cent was the right balance then, why is it not the right balance in this instance, when it is so easy to make shares available to employees? The Government are extraordinarily restrictive in limiting the figure to 3 percent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Isle of Wight said, what the Government are doing is very far from creating a level playing field. When Associated British Ports was privatised, the Government wrote off substantial debts. In this instance, debts must be met first by the privatising ports, but a massive levy on the proceeds of the privatisation remains. That is far from the Government's intention that there should be a level playing field. That will come home sharply to other trust ports as they contemplate whether to take that route to a more flexible structure that permits them to develop their profit facilities and the surrounding land opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems likely that the Government will discourage a development that they purport to favour and, in particular, will discourage it from taking forms that we should favour—forms that return substantial parts of these resources to the employees of the ports and to their local communities. The Government are effectively nationalising before privatising. The analogous case is that of the water industry. They ensure that they get the stake and in this case they have chosen the device of the levy. Tonight, the Chief Secretary issued the extraordinary threat that whatever action ports follow in future to find a better basis for a new privatised structure, there will be retrospective legislation. I have never before heard a Minister promise that, in future, he will introduce more and more retrospective legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman never listens</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot say that. I have argued many times on this subject with the Minster and his colleagues, occasionally with the assistance of other hon. Members. Usually, they are justifying retrospective measures that they have introduced. In this instance, the Minister says that, because of privatisation, if a port devises a new process that will give considerable assistance to the local community, and large amounts of shares are held by the company's employees, the Government will nevertheless exact 50 per cent of what the value would have been if that had not happened. They will introduce retrospective legislation to obtain tha 50 per cent—or, in effect, more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
than 50 per cent— whatever avenue is followed. That is purely and simply expropration. It would be a credit to any socialist Government, yet it is proposed by a Government who say that they want to introduce and extend privatisaiton of ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parliamentary ramifications are extraordinary. The Government are in great danger of producing hybrid Bills if they embark on that course. They nearly did so in this instance, by producing Bills that treat one case within a class very differently from others. The Government have got themselves into an extraordinary state. There seems to be no justification for their chosen course of action. If they feel—there is perhaps some basis for this feeling—that there are substantial funds that need not merely add extensively to the starting capitalisation of newly privatised ports, there are plenty of good uses to which those funds could be put—uses that are related to the ports in which the funds have been built up. That would be far better than simply clawing the money into the Exchequer and ensuring that, in every such venture, the Exchequer gets a massive slice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) felt that there was an abuse of the private Bill procedure because we have private Bills on particular ports on the Floor of the House and, at the same time, we have these provisions in the Finance Bill. As was made clear, in many respects we should have preferred comprehensive legislation. That is not possible because of the Government's timetable, but we welcome the fact that individual ports have taken the initiative of bringing forward the Bills that will enable them to operate with greater freedom and, effectively, to be privatised. However, an issue arises about the proceeds. Therefore, it seems appropriate that that matter—which relates to the public interests and what part of the proceeds should accrue to the Exchequer—should be tackled separately in the Finance Bill. That is not the use of a public Bill to promote a private one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East also said that the distinction between the Government and the state was unconvincing. It is not my distinction but that made by the courts in the case of the Trustee Savings bank. I did not, as my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) seemed to think, cite the National Audit Office as supporting this distinction. I was making another point about that office. However, the legal advice to the Government is that a similar distinction applies in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about why the levy is pitched at 50 per cent. Several different factors are involved and, of course, they include the needs of the ports. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
based his entire speech on the thesis that no money would go into the ports themselves. I agree that it is difficult to know at precisely what level the levy should be pitched. A normal capital gains tax charge of 17.5 per cent with the interaction with the levy, plus the 50 per cent levy makes a tax charge of 67.5 per cent, but that means a cash injection of 32.5 per cent. Many privatisations have been accompanied by an adjustment to the balance sheet, as my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight rightly said, but, with others, there has been no adjustment. It is not usual to hand over the proceeds of privatisation to the company, managment and workforce that is being privatised. A substantial injection of cash—32.5 per cent of the proceeds—will be given to the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was moonshine, built on nothing. It was complete nonsense. There will be cash injections for the development of the ports in addition to the fact that port authorities will be able to sell some of their assets and land and use the proceeds. I apologise to the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed for describing his speech so rudely but he exaggerated greatly because there will be considerable cash injections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary used the Trustee Savings Bank case to illustrate the distinction between the state and the Government. Can he tell us what the considerations were in that case which led the government not to impose a levy on the proceeds of that privatisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are considerable differences between the ports and the TSB cases. The TSB had millions of depositors, and millions bought shares. Furthermore, the Government had not contributed a penny to the bank in the past, so there are clear differences. I readily acknowledge that it is difficult to know at what point the levy should be pitched, but there are good grounds for saying that that it is right because there is a public interest and that part of the proceeds should be taken in the public interest—bearing in mind, as the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed rightly said, local needs and interests and the interests of the ports in future development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East suggested that, by introducing the scheme, the Government were going against the previous stand that I am alleged to have taken on workers' participation, especially in privatised companies. That is a bit rich coming from the hon. Gentleman, who has stated clearly that he is totally opposed to the privatisation of these ports. The workers there are greatly in favour of what we are doing—in favour, at least, of the ports being privatised. They will have a greater freedom which the hon. Gentleman seems to want to deny them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Isle of Wight raised a number of points. I am aware that he speaks with considerable authority because of his work on the Committee considering the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Bill. I was not surprised and that no one had made representations to him, that they were his reflections and conclusions after consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
My hon. Friend asked about the distinction between Government and state which I answered as best I could. He mentioned the contrast between what is proposed in the new clause and what happened with Associated British Ports. He was right to say that there was a debt write-off. In general in many privatisations, however, there has not been a substantial injection into the privatised company. Much depends on the facts of each case and on the health of the balance sheet. The arithmetic of the levy, with the interaction of capital gains tax, will mean an injection of funds into the ports. The difficulty will be in getting the amount right and in adjusting it to the circumstances of each port, because one charge must apply to all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I followed my right hon. Friend's argument correctly, the Government put no money into the Trustee Savings Bank and decided to privatise it via legislation. They have put money into the trust ports but decided not to privatise them by legislation, instead imposing a special levy on them. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but as I explained the choice of vehicle for the privatisation has been dictated in part by the demands of the Government's timetable and by the pressure on legislation in the house. It has not been possible to do it in any other way. We are pleased that a number of the ports have taken the initiative to bring forward their own legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East raised several detailed questions about tax. The hour is getting late, and I should prefer to give him the detailed answers in writing. However, my final point is the most important. My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight has expressed the fear—shared in a more exaggerated form by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed—that the levy would penalise the ports, thereby hindering their privatisation and development. The Government do not believe that that will be so, but my hon. Friend will be aware that we are empowered to alter the rate of the levy. In the past few days, I have had discussions with the Clyde port authority. My officials will continue those talks. We shall reconsider the rate of the levy if it emerges that it has been pitched at a level that will harm the privatisation of the ports. I hope that my hon. Friend will bear in mind that the levy must apply to all the ports and that it cannot be adjusted to suit individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed spoke about the proportion of preferential shares that would count against the levy. The 3 per cent figure applies only to the element of each share that is on preferential terms. Therefore, the proportion of the work force among whom it could be spread might be much larger than 3 per cent. That is more generous than in other privatisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the objections to the measure have been exaggerated. It is right, and analogous with previous privatisations, that the Government should take some of the proceeds. However, as I have emphasised, the Government have the power to vary the rate and I shall bear in mind some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has tried to answer an argument which is different from that which I advanced. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
did not argue that the ports would be hard up when the process is complete. Far from it: unless the tax levied against them is set at 110 per cent, and if they succeed in keeping the total levy and capital gains tax below 100 per cent, the ports will have at their disposal their original assets plus the proceeds of privatisation, minus the levy. That will give them more money than they had to start with. The argument is not that the ports will be hard up, but that the money raised should not go straight into the central Exchequer. It could be used on wider employee share ownership and the related community needs and facilities which are relevant to the port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not responded to that objection. They have said, as if to an ordinary taxpayer, "You are very lucky to be allowed to keep 75p in the pound of your money. We are being extremely generous in not taking l00p in the pound. You should think yourselves fortunate." To the communities around the ports, the Government are saying, "Think yourselves lucky that we are leaving your port with about 23p in the pound and that we are not giving you any of the money that we have taken away."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right, not only to oppose the principle behind the new tax, but to press for a Division at least on amendment (a) to new clause 69. That amendment would enable ports to dispose of their shares for a consideration below the market value. They could then place them to the advantage of the local community without suffering the same tax penalty that they would have suffered if the full market value of the shares had been realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government will not leave any room for the ports to take a constructive, sensible and community conscious course, they will find that some of the ports will not want to be privatised on a basis that is unhelpful to their local communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary and I are at one in the view that the treatment provided must be equal to each individual enterprise. It is also common ground between us that every port is unique, differing from others in terms of net assets. However, I do not believe that my right hon. Friend has thought the issues through. Despite the enormous team that he has with him, he has not been properly advised about the difficulties that he will create in trying to apply a universal tax rate across such a broad variety of individual circumstances. That is why the foundation of the proposals is shaky, and why I have proposed alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I have not persuaded my right hon. Friend, and that the Liberal Democrats are pressing for a vote. I had hoped that we would not divide and that we could return to the issue on Report. I was taught that port always follows the sun and passes to the left. On this occasion, however, I must tell my right hon. Friend that I have no ideological sympathy with the Bill whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. I should like to thank you and Mr. Coleman for presiding over the Committee so well. We admire you, Mr. Cormack, for returning to chair the Finance Committee for a second year. Mr. Crowther said that it was not the most riveting of Committees and that he would have preferred to listen to the Rotherham jazz band. We are delighted that you have returned, Mr. Cormack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to thank the Clerk, Mr. Rose, and his staff for all their assistance. I am grateful to Hansard staff, who always make sense of our contributions, with not assistance from us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been less controversial than in previous years, and I thank the Opposition for their good temper, good behaviour and restraint. They opposed the Bill critically and vigorously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my ministerial colleagues, especially my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, who has worked hard and extremely well. I am also grateful to my other hon. Friends. It is sometimes frustrating not to spend as much time on one's own pet schemes as one would like, although bad debts with banks did very well. On other aspects of the Bill, I am grateful for their good sense and restraint. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Sackville), the Government Whip, who has kept us all in order and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) more or less in order and in good relation. I thank everybody who has been associated with the friendly and constructive progress of the Bill, on both the Government and the Opposition Benches. I give special thanks to you, Mr. Cormack, and to Mr. Coleman, for presiding over the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Further to that point of order, Mr. Cormack. Perhaps I may also catch your eye for the last time in this Committee and join the Chief Secretary in thanking both you and Mr. Coleman for your courtesy, good nature and assistance throughout our proceedings. We thank also the learned Clerk— who is always constructive and helpful and, as the Chief Secretary said, does his best to keep us all on the right lines—and the Hansard reports for their assiduous work. We owe thanks to all the officers of the House whom we have kept here rather late from time to time and who have done so much to help us to be more comfortable in this Room than we have been on some previous occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always intimidating for the Opposition to see the swathes of people who come to and fro, changing in rapid shifts as the subjects change, to advise and support the Government in putting their argument. However, what the Opposition have lacked in numbers in terms of advisers has been made up for in quality, and I know that my hon. Friends will wish me to record the great debt of gratitude that we feel towards those who have worked long hours and done so much to help us. You will recognise, Mr. Cormack, that equally, we are not always as many in number as we would like on the Opposition Benches. Sadly, Committees reflect the composition of the House so we do not have as many members in Committee as there are on the Government Benches. Again, what we have sometimes lacked in numbers we have more than made up for in quality. There has been competition to serve on the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
this year within all parties and that competition has been reflected in the contribution that we have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Cormack, for mentioning how much we have missed my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and how much we regret his being stricken down by illness during the course of the Committee. Although he was not bodily with us, his discipline has nevertheless been exerted and preserved among Opposition Members throughout our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will recall my saying, Mr. Cormack, that it is 15 years since I served on a Finance Bill. I do not recall that Committee stage being quite as good humoured and constructive as the debates that we have had here and I offer these debates to Conservative Members as a worthy role model for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to finish by recording my personal thanks to all my hon. Friends and in particular to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench, who are a better team than anybody deserves to work with. They are always constructive, supportive, helpful and expert in their observations and immensely assiduous in their work. We are all fortuante in that. Again, Mr. Cormack, we all thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Further to that point of order, Mr. Cormack, I should like to endorse the thanks that were given to you and to your colleague, Mr. Coleman, by the Chief Secretary and to say how well your presided over the proceedings. I particularly value having on Thursdays a Chairman who appreciates the importance of catching the last train or plan north—a service to a number of Committee members who have constituencies a long way away. I, too, have particular reason to be thankful to the Clerk for his assistance and to all of our staff. I thank also my colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), who has contributed so excellently to the team, and those who have advised us. Some of us will no doubt be assembling in this Room in a year's time, but who knows on which side and whether we shall have had a general election by then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I do not share Mr. Crowther's passion for jazz, but there are many things that I would rather listen to at 12.25 am than consideration of the Finance Bill in Committee. Notwithstanding that, I would like to thank—on behalf of Mr. Coleman and myself—the Chief Secretary and the hon. Members for
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) and for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) for their kind words. I echo their thanks to our esteemed and learned Clerk and the Hansard reporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clerk tells me that although we have sat later than most other Finance Bill Committees for our final sitting, he at least managed to see a third of the Kirov ballet's performance this evening. I know that he is grateful to the Committee for co-operating with the timetabling so that he could do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a good-humoured Committee, as has already been remarked. I am told that we have added 30 pages or more to the Finance Bill. Whether or not that is a record, it is certainly a considerable feat. We have broken another record by being the first Finance Committee to sit in the Grand Committee Room for our entire proceedings. Whether the experiment is repeated will be up to right hon. and hon. Members to decide in future years. There are certain advantages in having a fixed location and I should like to thank the staff who helped us get over the initial difficulties and teething troubles by providing extra seats and improving the amplification as the sittings proceeded. I hope that members of the Committee will agree that it has been a reasonably comfortable room in which to meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate all members of the Committee on their good humour. In particular, I congratulate Government Back Benchers on restraining themselves more often than not, the members of the minority party on their dogged determination and persistence and the Opposition Members who, despite being in a minority, have fought a good battle throughout. I should like to single out the newcomer to the Opposition Front Bench, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), and say what a marked impression his excellent debating skills have made on us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish all members of the Committee a happy and relaxing summer and again I thank the Clerk and the staff. That concludes our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
