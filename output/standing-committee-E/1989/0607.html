INVESTMENT TRUSTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in Clause 47, page 38, line 40, after "amount", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2D) For the purposes of subsection 1(a) above, any income derived from transactions relating to futures contracts or options contracts shall where it is not excempted from tax by virtue of any provisions of the Taxes Acts, be regarded as deriving from shares or securities.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 86, in page 38, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2D) For the purposes of subsection 1(a) above, a company's income shall be regarded as deriving wholly or mainly from shares or securities if 70 per cent. of its income (including franked investment income) derives from shares or securities; provided that the Board of Inland Revenue may specify such lower percentage than 70 per cent. as they think fit for accounting periods ending between two specified dates.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2E) Where an investment trust commenced a business on a date not more than 15 months before the end of an accounting period, subsection (2D) above shall have effect in relation to such an accounting period as if for "70 per cent." there were substitued "50 percent.".'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say what a pleasure it is to be discussing these important issues under your chairmanship, Mr. Coleman? At our previous sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) revealed that he and I had fought tooth and nail for the privilege of dealing with these clauses. I am delighted to say that I won the battle on this occasion and will speak to the amendments to clause 47 that we tabled.<br><br>
The clause deals with investment trusts. I remind that Committee about their general position. They are not trusts at all as unit trusts arc, for example, but limited companies quoted on the Stock Exchange and they are old established. For example, the Bankers Investment Trust and the Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust date from the last century and existed long before unit trusts. They were brought into being to provide ways in which small investors could invest safely on the Stock Exchange<br><br>
Since the 1960s, they have largely been supplanted in popularity by unit trusts and various insurance companies' savings schemes. However, it is worth remembering that investment trusts remain very large funds. I understand that Globe Investment Trust Ltd is worth more than £1 billion. I believe that, largely for commercial rather than tax reasons, they arc closed funds—people invest in them by buying shares—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
whereas unit trusts are open funds which can increase as more investors come along.<br><br>
Overall, investment trusts have out-performed most of their rivals in giving good returns to small investors. That is partly due to their low expenses and lack of commission and front-end charges which are frequently incurred by unit trusts and other forms of savings schemes. In the 10 years to 31 December 1989, the average share index rose by 430 per cent., while average unit trusts rose by 497 per cent., which is not an outstanding performance in relation to the general rise in equities over that period. The average investment trust earnings rose by 752 per cent., so their performance was considerably better than that of unit trusts in that 10-year period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that the figures that he quoted do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that he drew? The performance of investment trusts might have been exactly the same, or worse, than that of unit trusts, but if the discount and the net assets of the investment trust had narrowed during the specific period, whatever the portfolio may have been, the performance of the investment trust would not have appeared to be better. The hon. Gentleman's conclusion does not follow from the figures that he quoted to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says is conceivable, but not necessarily true. The factors to which the hon. Gentleman referred could have been operating, but the clear indication from the figures is that investment trusts are providing a pretty good return and almost certainly a better return for their investors, when compared with other forms of collective savings. Since the 1960s, investment trusts have become less of a home for small investors, largely becauuse they have been seduced away to unit trusts as their market volume expanded. However, most investment trusts still have many investors—for example, there are more than 42,000 investors in Globe Investment Trust. Many now operate personal equity plans—which are dear to the Government's heart—as a monthly savings scheme to attract small investors back to investment trusts.<br><br>
The problem is that the investment trust sector is under threat because investment trust shares generally trade at an appreciable discount and may be taken over because they arc quoted companies. In current market conditions, pension funds may try to take them over as a cheap way of purchasing a large portfolio. An obvious example was the Coal Board's pension fund's bid for Globe Investment Trust. Public companies may take them over as a cheap form of rights issue, the most obvious recent example being Maxwell's takeover of the Philip Hill investment trust.<br><br>
It would be unfortunate if that trend were encouraged, or continued to too great an extent, because ultimately it could lead to investment trusts vanishing completely. One reason for their difficulty in fighting back, despite their good track record on investment and return, is that they are tax

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
disadvantaged compared to their chief rival, the unit trusts. That point should be remembered during our debate on the clause.<br><br>
The clause will exacerbate the disadvantage that investment trusts face. It provides advantages, to which we do not object, over unit trusts, but does not cover the problem of the tax disadvantage that faces investment trusts.<br><br>
I do not challenge your decision, Mr. Coleman, not to select amendment No. 87 for consideration, but we had hoped that the basic tax disadvantage—the 10 per cent. difference in the rate of tax—could have been discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming increasingly concerned about the extent to which I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Is he considering tabling a new clause to get round those difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always delighted when Conservative Members, especially the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot), agree with the sensible and progressive arguments advanced by Opposition Members. The course of action that the hon. Gentleman suggested is very much in our minds, and we hope to return later to the disparity in the tax treatment between unit trusts and investment trusts.<br><br>
I turn first to amendment No. 86 which is the simpler of the two amendments, although its text is longer. It would tackle the problem of the all-or-nothing regime that applies to investment trusts. Section 842 of the Taxes Act 1988 sets out several conditions which an investment trust must satisfy to qualify as an investment trust for tax purposes. A trust either qualifies or it does not. If it fails to satisfy one iota of those conditions, it fails to be accepted as an investment trust for tax purposes. No middle way is available to it. The problem is that section 842 against which that all-or-nothing nature of tax treatment will be judged is unclear. Our amendment attempts to clarify its provisions.<br><br>
Section 842(1) (a) states that a company's income must derive wholly or mainly from shares or securities. The phrase "wholly or mainly" would usually be interpreted by an ordinary individual as meaning that that income must be more than 50 per cent. The word "mainly" implies a majority, so a figure of 50 per cent. appears to be the condition laid down by the Taxes Act. However, the Inland Revenue has consistently laid down in practice that the figure is 70 per cent., not 50 per cent. The 70 per cent. test seems to have no specific legislative backing.<br><br>
Those conditions arc such that they can make or break the tax treatment of an investment trust. Given their importance, our amendment seeks to make the current practice adhered to by the Inland Revenue of 70 per cent. in shares and securities crystal clear and without demur by putting it into legislation. We arc not attempting to change Inland Revenue practice. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
want to clarify it, so that investments trusts know exactly where they stand.<br><br>
Amendment No. 84 relates to the definition of "shares and securities". There is some doubt about what that phrase covers. For example, is a certificate of tax deposit a security? At present, the Inland Revenue will resolve that question in discussion, but it is not clear in the legislation; nor is it clear what section 842(1)(e) of the Taxes Act 1988 means. The subsection is ambiguous. The Inland Revenue adopts the more rigorous interpretation: that the company's total retention must not exceed 15 per cent. of its income from shares and securities, rather than the alternative that its maximum retention should be 15 per cent. of that income, plus all income that does not come from shares and securities. Not surprisingly, no investment trust has dared to challenge the Inland Revenue view on the point, but as the legislation is ambiguous we believe that greater clarity is needed.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 84 specifically seeks to tackle this question: several investment trusts have a substantial income from futures or options contracts. It is not clear whether that income should be taxed as income, or regarded as tax-free capital gains—and if taxable, whether or not it derives from shares or securities. Several investment trusts, especially in Scotland, but also some in England, are worried about the fact that they may have lost their investment trust status in the years 1986 to 1988. We want it to be made clear what is included in the definition of shares or securities, especially as it relates to futures or options contracts.<br><br>
Given its overall importance to the life, well-being and future planning of investment trusts, section 842 of the Taxes Act must be crystal clear. The amendments seek to achieve that clarity.<br><br>
We trust that the Government will listen to our arguments on futures and options in amendment No. 84, and on the 70 per cent. proportion in amendment No. 86. These are practical considerations which worry the industry. This would be a useful moment, with clause 47, on investment trusts, before us, to put these two matters right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join my opposite number in welcoming you to the Committee, Mr. Coleman.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) suggested, rather apocalyptically, that the investment trust sector is disappearing. In fact, 30 new investment trusts have been set up in the past six months, so there is every sign of life and vigour in a valuable part of our investment spectrum.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised some specific points: he suggested that investment trusts arc at a tax disadvantage compared with unit trusts. The different tax regimes for investment trusts and authorised unit trusts recognise the differences in the nature of these collective investment vehicles. The similarities are also recognised. Both are exempted from capital gains tax, for example. It would not be right to give investment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
trusts all the advantages of their existing tax regimes, plus all those of the single tax regime for all authorised unit trusts that will be established with effect from 1 January 1991.<br><br>
Investment trusts have several advantages over authorised unit trusts. The hon. Gentleman suggested the reverse. Those advantages stem from them being companies and taxed as such. They can gear up through substantial borrowing, the interest on which gets tax relief, whereas unit trusts can borrow at most an amount equal to 10 per cent. of their assets. Investment trusts can adopt complicated capital structures, such as split-level investment trusts. They can have corporate shareholders without those shareholders facing any tax penalty. Non-life corporate shareholders in unit trusts, of which there are a few, may face a 10 per cent. tax penalty on income from United Kingdom equities. A sizeable proportion of investors in investment trusts are corporate, and, therefore, receive that benefit. Investment trusts can make new share issues, where the limit for inclusion within a personal equity plan is £6,000-worth of shares and not the £3,000 that otherwise applies for unit trusts and investment trusts with 50 per cent. United Kingdom equity investment. Therefore, the playing field is not as tilted in one direction as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury suggested.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also said that there was no middle way in the regime, it was a matter of all or nothing and that section 842 of the Taxes Act 1988 was unclear. The objective of amendment No. 86 was to put that right. He suggestes that it is unfair that a failure to meet the income test in section 842(1)(a) means loss of investment trust status and so, loss of exemption from tax on capital gains, but that is not the case. Investment trust status carries the privilege of exemption from capital gains tax. That status is determined solely by reference to tests laid down in the Taxes Act 1988 and it must right that that status is lost if those tests are not satisfied. There must be some enforceable limit on which quota companies qualify for exemption from tax on capital gains.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute what the Financial Secretary has just said, but my point is that if investment trusts are to know how to operate the conditions that must be satisfied for them to have the privilege of taxation treatment as an industrial trust must be made absolutely clear. Our amendments attempt to deal with the lack of clarity in the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to come on to that. There is leeway in the law and the way in which it is operated. Investment trusts have to derive only 70 per cent. of their income from shares and securities. The Inland Revenue said in a statement of practice that it will look sympathetically on inadvertent breaches of that rule if, exceptionally, a profit on a forward currency contract is treated as income for tax purposes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has suggested that the law is uncertain and requires clarification. Where the law is uncertain, the Inland Revenue publish, when possible, statements of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
practice on how it is prepared to interpret the law. The Inland Revenue approach to the investment trust income test was published in statement of practice 1/1988 which was press released on issue. It is not possible to say with confidence that the courts would define "wholly or mainly" in the same way as the Inland Revenue, but areas of uncertain law, such as this, seem proper candidates for statements of practice. The statement of practice has worked and has been accepted and not challenged by the industry. It is unnecessary rigidly to impose it in law, as suggested by the amendment. If the amendment were accepted, it would be unclear how the option to go below 70 per cent. would be applied.<br><br>
The Inland Revenue has also accepted that in the first accounting period after commencement the figure can be as low as 51 per cent. It is not clear in what circumstances the hon. Gentleman would wish the Inland Revenue to exercise the discretion provided and to adopt different rules. The amendment makes matters uncertain, rather than clarifying them.<br><br>
I now turn to amendment No. 86. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said that doubts existed about the meaning of shares and securities. The Inland Revenue told the Association of Investment Trust Companies that a certificate of deposit was not a security. That is now clearly understood. The hon. Gentleman also claimed that the 15 per cent. test set out in section 842(1)(e) of the Taxes Act 1988 was uncertain. It is not. It is interpreted in the way that he explained. The AITC knows how it is applied.<br><br>
The amendment would facilitate passing the income test and thus attaining investment trust status and exemption from tax on capital gains. That could lead to unwelcome abuse. I am glad of the opportunity to clarify points that are generally recognsied by the industry. I am happy to make matters even clearer, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has not tackled whether futures and options would count as shares or securities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 30 per cent. of income that does not have to derive from securities can come from dealing in futures and options. Leeway is, therefore, already incorporated. If futures and options deals are hedging deals, they produce capital gains, which are not counted in the measure of income from which the 70 per cent. is judged. That would not use up any of the flexibility that could be used for trading the remaining 30 per cent. in options and futures. They have more flexibility than most other investment media.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary will perhaps enter the Committee's record book for creating the concept of a tilted playing field, which he denied existed in the comparison between the tax treatment of investment trusts and unit trusts. We shall return to that later. The Opposition believe that disparity exists and that the confidence with which the Financial Secretary claimed that it did not, is misplaced.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not deny that the playing field was tilted; I claimed that it was not as tilted in one direction as the hon. Gentleman suggested. I suggest that the playing field is tilted in several directions simultaneously, which cancel each other out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The concept develops more ramifications by the minute. Our discussions will become even more interesting.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary has failed to tackle either of the points raised by the Opposition. The first point was about the lack of statutory backing for the 70 per cent. figure imposed by the Inland Revenue. The Financial Secretary said that the 70 per cent. figure had been issued as a statement of practice. He did not deny that no statutory backing existed for it. I hope that when he returns to his office, he will realise that it would be wise to enshrine that important figure in legislation rather than to operate by practice note.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary claimed that amendment No. 86 created extra uncertainty. The amendment seeks to remove the uncertainty that exists about the words "wholly" or "mainly" in the clause and to substitute the 70 per cent. provision. New subsection (2E) provides a get-out, which contains specific provisions for new investment trusts that have commenced their business not more than 15 months before the end of an accounting period. That is very clear and allows important flexibility for new trusts.<br><br>
When I probed the Financial Secretary about whether futures and options counted as shares or securities, he seemed to say that they did not, but that some flexibility existed when they were hedging provisions rather than a major part of a substantive portfolio. Many people outside the Committee will read the Financial Secretary's words with care. Whether and in what circumstances futures and options count as shares or securities is important for investment trusts when making tax calculations. The Financial Secretary's response was unsatisfactory. I hope that he will reconsider both the 70 per cent. issue and the need to be clearer about futures and options, and that he will return to those matters later. In order to assist progress, I beg to ask leave leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Clause 47 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed. That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause simply inserts schedule 8 into the Bill. Schedule 8 and clauses 48 and 51 cover securities and the labyrinthine tax system which deals with them.<br><br>
It is worth noting the comments of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which expressed the matter extremely well in its observation about tax. It mentions last year's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
changes and those proposed for this year in the whole securities tax regime. The IFS states that, as a result of the changes last year and this year,
<br><blockquote><p>"there are ordinary debts and securities: sterling and foreign currency securities: qualifying and non-qualifying corporate bonds: convertible and non-convertible securities: securities issued at a deep discount and those not so issued: deep gain securities and non-deep gain securities, each of which may be subject to some different form of tax regime. And if the proposals put forward in the latest consultative paper"—</p></blockquote>
which are largely the proposals that we are discussing—
<br><blockquote><p>"are adopted we shall have qualifying and non-qualifying convertible securities and qualifying and non-qualifying indexed securities."</p></blockquote>
All of those different forms of security attract different taxation rules. It is surely nonsensical to have so complicated a system. The Institute adds:
<br><blockquote><p>"The challenge that faces us is to sec if there is not an easier way to achieve a rational regime for taxing securities, without the layer upon layer of technical complication and obscurity."</p></blockquote>
I very much endorse that conclusion. The provisions of clause 48, schedule 8 and the other clauses that we are about to discuss will only deepen the complexity of the problem. I hope that, in the tranquility of the next few months, the Government will consider rationalising the taxation regime for securities so that it is simpler and more comprehensible to ordinary people.<br><br>
It is important that we understand the effect of the clauses under consideration, and that requires a little background. Until the early 1980s, the tax treatment of bonds issued at a discount or redeemed at a premium was not clear. The general opinion was that such bonds were not usually attractive, because the issuer might not get a deduction for the discount or premium and because the return for the investor would usually be taxed. Such bonds became more attractive when indexation allowances meant that capital profits would often be assessed as a nil or small taxable capital gain. The Government decided in 1984 to allow issuers a deduction on a yield basis year by year for any discount or premium, but still to tax investors only on a receipts basis where a security was issued at a deep discount—defined as 15 percent., or over 0.5 percent. a year—and provided that certain strict conditions were met. By 1989, those bonds had proliferated, partly because they were sometimes linked to conversion into equities. The investor accepted a low interest rate, thus producing cheap finance for the issuer and either a premium on redemption or shares instead of any principal repayment.<br><br>
In 1989, it was thought right that the return on bonds issued at a discount or redeemed at a premium should generally be taxed as income, not as capital gain, even when the bonds were not deep discount securities. We supported that decision, believing it right to switch the taxation regime from capital to income taxing the profit as capital gain would usually have produced little, if any, tax due to the indexation allowances and the non-liability of overseas residents to capital gains tax.<br><br>
Therefore, in 1989, the deep gain legislation was introduced. We supported that: it was broadly an anti-avoidance measure and attacked certain securities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
which the issuers did not want to be deep discount securities and for which the existing regime was too generous. Even at the time, it was realised that the deep gain rules had to be drawn widely to catch all kinds of securities where the uplift—whether on a sale by a holder or on redemption—should be taxed as income rather than gain and that as a consequence, many exceptions would be needed to exclude innocent cases. The net was being drawn wide to catch the non-innocent but, in the process, exceptions had to be included to allow the innocent to survive. As a result, the Finance Act 1989 excluded from the net any deep discount security, all shares, qualifying indexed securities as defined, certain types of gilt and all convertible securities as defined—which broadly meant a quoted convertible issued before 8 June 1989. The significance of that date is that it was when the Finance Bill Committee debated the matter. The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) will remember it particularly well because he was active in our debates.<br><br>
However, that left subsequently issued convertibles caught by the deep gain legislation if they were issued with an option to redeem at a premium exercisable by the investor at the appropriate time. It was felt that the premium in such cases had to be regarded partly as income, because it was a guaranteed profit, but that part of the return might be akin to gains on the underlying equities which should be taxed as capital. Consultations were promised by the Minister during our debates last year. Those consultations took place and the basic principle that the Government adumbrated in the consultation document that they issued was that any guaranteed income element should be charged as income whereas the balance should be taxed as capital gain. That is a principle with which we concur because it is a sensible regime and broadly follows the regime set out for deep discount securities.<br><br>
As we embark upon this part of the Bill, I thought it appropriate to set out the background as clearly as is possible with such complex legislation. We broadly support the thrust of schedule 8 but we have a number of detailed questions which will be more appropriately discussed under the amendments to it. As to the general principle, we accept the division between income and capital which the Government seek to enshrine in the measures on convertible securities but we wish that they would sit down sensibly, over a sustained period, and come up with a more rational and easily understandable tax regime for securities—not to let any sharp practice through the tax net but to ensure that people are clearer about where the tax treatment of securities lies. At the moment, it is undoubtedly far too complex.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should leave clause 48 out of the Bill because then we need not bother considering schedule 8, which is excessively complex. As my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary knows, 1 raised the subject of the complexity of tax legislation in a recent Adjournment debate. The schedule is a good example of unintelligible, complex tax legislation which simply increases compliance costs for taxpayers and also presumably increases costs

for the Inland Revenue. Will my hon. Friend tell us how much extra revenue the schedule will raise? Perhaps I should put it the other way round and ask how much revenue would be lost if we did not agree to it.<br><br>
I have received a letter from 120 Cheapside. Do you know who lives there, Mr. Coleman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not either. The letter is written on rather smart paper and does not bear a company name. I do not think that it is from Lonrho, which is further up the road. [Hon. Members: "Down the road."] Yes. It might be from a merchant bank—[Hon. Members: "Schroder."] My hon. Friends tell me that it is Schroder, so the letter comes from a reputable source. It says that it is
<br><blockquote><p>"particularly ironic that Schedule 8 of the current Finance Bill absorbs 13 pages to introduce the most complex legislation to deal with what by any standards must be one of the most trivial issues."</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to cite some of the points just made by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith).<br><br>
Before we agree to such complex legislation, we should have an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A consultative document entitled, "Tax Treatment of Convertible and Equity Indexed Securities" was issued by the Inland Revenue in October 1989. In response, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales made representations in November 1989. This measure goes a long way towards meeting the institute's comments, particularly on relief available to the issuer in these circumstances. I regret, as does the institute, not having the opportunity to comment on the measure before its inclusion in the Bill. I have said on previous Finance Bill Committees that for issues as complex as this one, where the contents of the schedule take up many pages, responsible organisations should be able to comment in advance of its inclusion in the Bill.<br><br>
The measure is perforce complex—I accept that legislation on this matter is bound to be. It must have come as a surprise to certain members of the Committee that the shortest clause in the Bill relates to the longest schedule. Nevertheless, the schedule contains a number of traps for the unwary which go beyond what is necessary to protect the Inland Revenue. For example, a holder of a qualifying convertible security who was expecting to convert his holding into ordinary shares and thus not incur a liability to tax on income could find himself so liable through events over which he had no control and which probably could not be organised to allow him to convert his holding into ordinary shares beforehand.<br><br>
Paragraph 5(3) of schedule 8 provides that a prohibited event occurs if the security ceases to be quoted. That could happen if a company was in financial difficulties. A prohibited event can also occur if 10 per cent. of the securities arc owned by linked
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
companies. With transfers, someone could find that he has no control over an event yet become liable due to certain transfers by trustees described in paragraph 19 or death as provided by paragraph 16.<br><br>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales suggests that securities held by someone before one of the prohibited events which I mentioned should retain the status of qualifying convertible securities while in the hands of that holder so that he can convert them into ordinary shares without penalty. The institute want to delete paragraph 16 and to put personal representatives and legatees in the same position as the deceased had been so that they can covert their holding to ordinary shares without being charged income tax. Beneficiaries for whom trustees have transferred securities should be in the same position as trustees. Many accountants, including me, do not understand why the issuer should be permitted to introduce an acceptable replacement put option but not be allowed to state that publicly in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of those who have contributed to the debate have concentrated on the schedule's undeniable complexity. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) mentioned the debate which he instigated, and to which I had the privilege of responding, in which he called for greater simplicity and for consultation on tax legislation. The measures are the consequence of consultation. We are dealing with a complex matter. It has been created by sophisticated people constantly adapting instruments to different circumstances to meet their customers' needs. Sometimes such people try to exploit tax loopholes and advantages. We must allow them to produce instruments that are sophisticated enough to cope with the real world without creating opportunities for tax avoidance.<br><br>
We had extensive consultations about that aspect. I have a letter from another City institution which is less ashamed of its identity—S. G. Warburg. It is addressed to the director of the savings and investment division of the Inland Revenue and says that that institution wants to
<br><blockquote><p>"thank you and your colleagues in writing for the effort you have all put into re-designing the taxation of convertibles since last year's Budget.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We very much appreciate the seriousness with which the Revenue sought out, and the flexibility with which it listened to, the thinking of the market. And the result, as expressed in the Press Release, seems to be an excellent advertisement for the consultative process. We were pleased to be invited to help."</p></blockquote>
There are several views on the subject. We would all prefer a simpler solution if it were possible. We would look favourably upon any simplifying amendments, but I suspect that they could not capture the sophistication inherent in schedule 8. We arc therefore lumbered with this complex legislatioin. None the less, it will allow the City of London to remain supreme in the field.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) shared the anxiety about the schedule's excessive length and queried the provisions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
that govern the announcement of further put options. The method of separating income from capital relies on the known put option premium also being a measure of the investor's expectation of what he will receive. If the issuer were permitted to give early notice of a future put option opportunity, that would be quickly reflected in the market value of the bond but would not be included in the computed income elements on which the investor is liable to income tax. The complex rules minimise the scope for such manipulation, but they permit the issuer to build into the terms of issue a facility to offer further put options, provided that he does not announce the terms prematurely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's explanation of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). However, I hope that he will bear in mind that when finance directors meet owners of securities, having seen that the share price has not performed well and knowing that after a period everyone will take the same market decision, it will be extremely difficult for them to accord with the vague terms, to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred, about having that further option. When meeting institutional holders, for example, it is difficult not to give that pointer, which is specifically not allowed under the provisions of that paragraph of the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those in business and in the City are used to the fact that in many circumstances they are not allowed to talk about the future as they might wish to and as might be demanded of them by those present at meetings. They are used to being patient and so will be well-trained for acting in the same way in these circumstances, otherwise they will be breaking the law or rendering their instrument invalid.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes referred to the possibility that events out of the owner's control could create tax liabilities, such as transfers by a trustee's death. No income charge on conversion will arise, even if qualifying status is lost. It may be necessary for me to write to my hon. Friend and elaborate on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 1 want to underline a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes made, as it requires further reflection. Under paragraph 5(3)(f), most of the variations are within the control of the issuer, but some arc not. if ICI. for example, were to buy 11 per cent. of the securities covered by that paragraph, different terms would apply than if ICI bought 5 per cent. and a subsidiary bought 6 per cent. That would breach the schedule and would affect not just ICI's shares but the ownership of third parties which had no influence on ICI's decision to purchase in its own name or in its own name and that of a subsidiary.<br><br>
Paragraph 5(3)(f) deals directly with that. Will my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary consider writing to me and to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes because this serious, detailed and complex point deserves more thought?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to my hon. Friends the Members for Richmond and Barnes and for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) on the matter, but my answer will be roughly along the lines that the phrase "connected persons" does not mean two persons connected with each but unconnected with the issuer of the bond; it refers to a connection with the issuer of the bond, so, consequently, two subsidiaries of ICI buying someone else's bond do not trigger off the consequences that my hon. Friend supposes. However, I shall elaborate further in correspondence with him.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"provided that where any interest payment date would otherwise fall on a non-banking day no breach of the conditions in this subparagraph or subparagraph (10) above shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of the interest in question being payable on the immediately preceding or next succeeding banking day."</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In introducing the first amendment that we discussed, the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said that there had been a great competition between himself and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) about who should deal with that part of the Bill, that they had tossed a coin and he won. In the competition between myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) about who should deal with these amendments, we tossed a coin and he won. That is why I am moving this amendment. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has already done me and the Committee a great favour by providing the background to these clauses and the anomalies that they were intended to correct. So attentive were his hon. Friends that they have made my task that much easier.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
I endorse the comments made by the hon. Members for Islington, South and Finsbury and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) about this schedule and the ever-increasing complexity of our taxation law. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said, the schedule goes on for 13 pages. The Law Society has drawn attention to a discrepancy. In some respects, there may be comparability between what is being done for convertible securities this year and what was done in the previous year for deep gain securities, but there are discrepancies between schedule 8 to the Bill and schedule 11 to the Finance Act 1989. That cannot make<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
life easy for those who have to operate the system in practice.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury gave many examples of different tax regimes that apply to different forms of securities. I certainly endorse the arguments that have been made in favour of simplifying taxation law. Many provisions developed as anti-avoidance measures. At the time, it was proper for the Treasury and Inland Revenue to ensure that transactions that could lead to gain for individuals were treated and taxed as income rather than capital gains. When it was advantageous to characterise gain as part of capital rather than income, it was accepted on both sides that there was some purpose in anti-avoidance legislation.<br><br>
Over recent years, however, rates of capital gains tax and income tax have been significantly equalised—no doubt, the Government will take credit for that. The Financial Secretary did not answer the question put by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on how much revenue would be lost if the schedule were not enacted. I suspect that we are reaching the stage where taxing under capital gains as opposed to income tax would make little difference. That puts an even greater question mark over why we should be spending time and wasting paper promulgating such detailed and complex legislation.<br><br>
The amendment would delete the condition that at the time the security was issued it should be quoted in
<br><blockquote><p>"the official list of a recognised stock exchange."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to establish more precisely what the Inland Revenue is worried about. If it is the use of convertible securities to avoid income tax, one would have assumed logically that that should apply across the board, not merely to quoted securities.<br><br>
I did not serve on the Finance Bill Committee last year, but I understand that provisions relating to qualifying corporate bonds were extended to all securities, not merely to quoted ones, because of perceived abuses. It would be interesting to find out why that provision was adopted in 1989 and covered corporate bonds, but docs not apply this year.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to try to find out more about the Government's intentions. It highlights one small issue, and related amendments highlight others. The stand part debate on clause 48 revealed how detailed and technical we have become. One often finds that, when one tries to stamp out one abuse or anomaly, several others spring up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall address my remarks to amendments Nos. 91 and 94 which have been grouped with amendment No. 153 because they also relate to paragraph 2 of schedule 8.<br><br>
The purpose of paragraph 2 is to define the conditions under which a deep gain security is regarded as a qualifying convertible security. It seems odd that in subparagraph (8) reference is made not only to a deep gain security but to a deep discount security. Our amendment, which would delete that subparagraph, is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
purely a probing amendment because we want the Government to explain why they included both deep gain securities and deep discount securities. Surely, we are concerned only with securities that are deep gain securities solely because of the put option, which is the case covered by subparagraph (8)(b), and we do not see a need for subparagraph (8)(a) to be in the schedule. If a security is already a deep discount security and treated as such within the tax regime, surely it should be left as one and taxed under the deep discount security rules. There is no need to include it within the provisions of that subparagraph, which should appropriately deal with deep gain securities, so we ask the Government to tell us why they included both.<br><br>
Amendment No. 94 relates to paragraph 2(11) which provides that one condition of relief for a qualifying security is that interest is payable at precisely six-monthly or annual intervals. That cannot be done if the interest payment date is not a banking day, and our amendment would solve that minor anomaly. The provisions in subparagraph (11) are unfulfillable in some circumstances and we merely seek to make them fulfillable.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will accept both amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) reiterated the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith)—I apologise for not answering it earlier—about the revenue implications if the schedule were not enacted. It is not possible to quantify that, but indexation relief results in much lower capital gains tax than income tax on the equivalent income, hence continuing schemes would be invented to convert capital into income. That is the reason why, when there is an opportunity, people invent schemes to convert capital into income and, no doubt, they would do so on a significant scale if allowed that opportunity. The potential losses are quite substantial.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland asked why last year's legislation covered all securities while this year's cover only quoted securities. This year's legislation is relieving, unlike the deep gains legislation. Quoted securities have prospectuses setting out all conditions, and, effectively, the condition that they be quoted weeds out many tailor-made tax avoidance securities that would otherwise be created. This is, therefore, a useful and simple way of weeding out tax avoidance options without going into long specifications of them and trying to imagine what they might be. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that that is a virtuous intent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) asked why paragraph 2(8) was necessary. The various conditions in paragraphs 1 and 2 of schedule 8 mean that, without the new schedule, most qualifying securities would have been deep discount rather than deep gain securities. This is an inevitable result of the fact that the new rules, and particularly the formula for calculating income elements, arc largely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
derived from the deep discount provisions. However, paragraph 26 of the schedule amends schedule 4 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to ensure that a bond issued on or after 1 August 1990 cannot be a deep discount security if it is convertible into share capital. In effect, that means that paragraph 2(8)(a), on deep discount securities is the operative condition for most bonds issued between 9 June 1989 and 31 July 1990 whereas paragraph 2(8)(b) on deep gain securities is the operative condition for all bonds issued on or after 1 August 1990. I am sure that my explanation has made the matter thoroughly clear to the hon. Gentleman and shows why this part of the legislation is necessary. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman's amendment is essentially a probing one, but were it adopted, it would wreck the schedule, which 1 know is not his intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his lucid explanation of the reasons for the inclusion of deep discount securities in subparagraph (8)(a), but he has not dealt with the provisions of amendment No. 94 which deal with the problem of a precise time period falling outside a normal banking day. I should have thought that that was a simple matter and not beyond the Financial Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I apologise for not doing that. The matter is simple and I can almost claim to understand it. Amendment No. 94 is unnecessary because paragraph 11 of the schedule defines an interest payment day as
<br><blockquote><p>"a day on which interest is payable under the security."</p></blockquote>
When an interest payment day falls on a non-working day, nothing prevents interest from being paid immediately after or before that day. That common wording is used elsewhere in this sort of legislation. Although the amendment attempts to be helpful, its intent is already met by current practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for responding to that point. He drew a distinction between this year's and last year's provisions. Last year's applied to bonds that were quoted or unquoted. I think that he was trying to say that if this formula for defining a condition were not adopted, another formula might have added a further two pages to the schedule. I prefer that reason for rejecting the amendment.<br><br>
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said of schedule 8:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not think that the problem warrants such complex legislation and we consider that it should be withdrawn."</p></blockquote>
Many members of the Committee would agree with that.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 124, line 41, leave out from '(b)' to 'become' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"there were no arrangements in place at any time prior to the relevant day by virtue of which it was likely that the security would".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 4 provides a limited ability for a qualifying convertible security to remain a qualifying convertible security even if a new provision for redemption is created. One restriction on that under paragraph 4(3)(b) is that the new provision must not have been indicated to the holder by the issuer. The principle is right and fair but we are worried that the word "indicate" is vague and we propose to tighten up the wording and make it clearer.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
There is a well-established test in the group relief and advance corporation tax rules which serves a similar function and is fairly well understood. Amendment No. 93 replaces the vague indication test which the Government have inserted into the subparagraph with something more precise based on the test accepted in other widely used legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. Before the Financial Secretary stands up, may I ask whether it would be in order for him to cease using the phrase "tailor-made tax avoidance measures"? If he is recommending that I should go into business marketing them, perhaps he will exempt me from any capital gains tax or corporation tax thereupon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Financial Secretary will have heard the hon. Gentleman's words. however, the use of his name in this Committee is surely a compliment to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 1 am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) for drawing that point to my attention—first because it gives me an opportunity to apologise to him and secondly because it forewarns me that I should not use that phrase on the Floor of the House where Mr. Speaker might also have reservations about its use.<br><br>
The point that I made earlier in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell)—who has left the Room—is relevant to the amendment. I explained that this element in the schedule is necessary because the amount which is taxed as income rather than capital gain is calculated on the basis of the existing put option and premium. If issuers were allowed to give early notice of future put opportunities, these would be reflected immediately in the market price—but not in the computed income elements—and any uplift would be taxed as capital. While we wanted to prevent such conversion of income to capital, we did not want to stop companies from incorporating, in the terms of the issue, the necessary facility to offer further options in future.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
The present wording steers a course between these two objectives by preventing issuers from offering implicit or explicit undertakings about future put options, while minimising the extent of any interference with normal issuing practice. The alternative wording proposed in the amendment may shift the balance between the objectives—depending on how it is construed—but it makes it no easier for the requirement to be monitored or complied with. In short, it does nothing to improve the present draft. Although I am always well disposed towards the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and am anxious to accept his amendment, its acceptance would not help us to achieve his objective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely satisfied with the Financial Secretary's response because the problem is not whether the provision will be easier to monitor or comply with but whether we are all absolutely certain what the provision is. We are worried about the potential for ambiguity and the width of definition of the word "indicate". However, it may be better for us to allow the Government to include their wording in this provision. Perhaps they will keep a careful eye on how the provision is operated to see whether the phrasing is sufficient to avoid the nod and wink sort of indication that new provisions for redemption might be created in future. We are anxious to avoid that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 92, in 8, page 128, line 2, after 'time', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'and for the purpose of paragraph 5(3)(f) above a company shall be regarded as holding a security at any time when it is beneficially entitled to it.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with paragraph 5. which states that a security shall cease to be a qualifying convertible security if one of several events happen. One condition is if 10 per cent. of the securities of that type in issue are held by linked companies. That is the terms of paragraph 5(3)(f). The usual test is not whether the company holds 10 per cent. of securities, but whether it is beneficially entitled to 10 per cent. of securities. Our amendment would ensure that the usual test of beneficial entitlement should be used instead of simply providing for the holding of 10 per cent. Such a provision is not as tightly drawn as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) will find that paragraph 10 already provides that a person will be treated as holding a security if and when he is entitled to it. That provision includes a company, and covers the point at which the amdendment is directed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the provisions of paragraph 10(5). Schedule 8 has been my bedside reading for many a long night. I am not entirely sure that my argument about beneficial entitlement is met as paragraph 10 refers simply to entitlement at a specific time. In the interests of progress, perhaps it is best to leave that matter as a potential disagreement to

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are linked, and refer to paragraph 12 in part II of schedule 8. They would make the chargeable event at the time of transfer subject not only to the two conditions in subparagraph (1), but to a third condition—that the amount obtained on the transfer exceeded £50,000. I am advised that it might be almost impossible to calculate the income element of a gain without either a sophisticated actuarial table or a computer with an appropriate program.<br><br>
Inserting a gain amount for which the provisions would not apply would help the person with a small investment. The condition should not apply unless a significant amount of tax is at stake. It should not necessarily oblige someone to resort to professional advice. It is important to emphasise that that gain would not be tax free; it would be subject to capital gains tax instead of income tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to press the amendment. The Minister underlines the point that I made in response to the previous amendment—if some practical means can be found to help the small investor, we will welcome it. There may well have to be some arbitrary cut-off point, but the complex nature of these arrangements makes some help necessary, and I hope that attention will be given to a practical means of providing it.<br><br>

DEEP CAIN SECURITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6.00 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 39, line 3, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'In the ease of a security issued on or after 9th June 1989'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 157, in clause 50, page 40, line 5, leave out from 'price' to end of line 6.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that one of the purposes of clause 49 is to take account of those occasions when the deep gain provisions have had some unintended consequences. They were initially retrospective in effect and caught all securities when they were issued, including those that had been issued before the legislation was mooted. In cases of insolvency, people have been caught out by events beyond their control. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) mentioned them in the clause 48 stand part debate.<br><br>
The provisions of clause 49 are welcome to the extent that they attempt to deal with circumstances where some unforeseen and unintended event has taken place. My amendment seeks to discover why the relief in the clause applies only to securities issued on or after 9 June 1989. That seems rather unreasonable given that the general provisions apply to all securities—even those issued before the 1989 legislation was published.<br><br>
Why have the Government picked that cut-off point? I know that it is not an arbitrary choice, as it relates to the date when the provisions were debated in Committee on last year's Finance Bill. Why is the limited relief in clauses 49 and 50 limited to those who have securities issued after that date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pondered the import of the amendment. If I understand the hon. Gentleman, and am right in identifying the line of the legislation to which he is referring, I think that there may be some misunderstanding by one of us about the nature of the date chosen.<br><br>
Securities issued prior to that date are grandfathered, and are treated not under the subsequent legislation but under the pre-existing legislation and so do not need the protection that the hon. Gentleman appears to be seeking to give them. If that is not his purpose, perhaps I could write to him with further explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was generous enough to suggest that his misunderstanding equalled mine. This is an unusual reversal of roles, in which, instead of me asking the Financial Secretary to go away and think about it, he might reasonably ask me to do the same. I shall certainly do so and see whether I should pursue the matter further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 150, in page 39, line 10, leave out 'or'.<br><br>

No. 152, in page 39, line 14, at end insert 'or—
<br><blockquote><p>(d) the provisions of the security under which the redemption is made were only intended to protect the position of the holder of the security in his capacity as a creditor of the issuer and the obtaining of a tax advantage by any person was not the main benefit, or one of the main benefits, that might be expected to accrue from the provisions.'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to make life simpler, unless a substantial amount is involved. Perhaps I am too optimistic, but I hope that the Financial Secretary will accept that the amendment has some merit in cases in which the amounts involved are relatively small.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the purpose of this group of amendments, which is to ease the position of so-called small investors in convertible securities. The amendments would do so by exempting from a charge to income tax any transfers of qualifying convertibles when the amount obtained was not more than £50,000.<br><br>
I realise that the new rules are rather complex; that is necessarily so. They are particularly difficult for those who do not have access to legal and commercial advice and the amendments are motivated by concern for such people. However, convertible bonds of the kind dealt with by the new schedule are relatively specialised instruments. They tend to be bought and sold in large lots and used by financially sophisticated institutions and individuals. The problem that these changes seek to address is likely to be very small, if it exists at all.<br><br>
It is difficult to justify the imposition of an arbitrary distinction between transfers which exceed £50,000 and those which do not. Why should a transfer which brings the investor £49,999 escape income tax when one which brings him £2 more would be subject to the full charge? That is, of course, the difficulty with any such provision when a limit is set. As the limit would be set by reference to the size of the proceeds from the sale of bonds, what would prevent a large transaction from being fragmented into a series of smaller ones which would escape the charge? That would encourage large holders to sell bonds in small lots shortly before the exercise date for the put option.<br><br>
Although the amendments are well intentioned, they are wholly impracticable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his endorsement of our good intention. He said that whenever such limits are set, some people fall on the wrong side. I suggest that those who fall into the poverty trap are more harshly treated when they fall just on the wrong side than are those who feel that they have a grievance because they fall on the wrong side of a £50,000 limit.<br><br>
I realise that the Financial Secretary will not give way on this matter, but I hope that he accepts the general point. Perhaps after further consideration he will see a way, either before Report or before next year's Finance Bill, to give some relief to small investors.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 133, line 32, after "security", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Where sub-paragraph (2) above applies and the amount paid on redemption does not exceed £50,000, the company shall calculate the chargeable amount in respect of the security being redeemed, and within six months of the redemption notify that amount in writing to the person redeeming the security.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment was tabled almost as a fallback because we envisaged the response to the previous group of amendments. The purpose of the amendment is to give practical assistance to the small investor who may not have professional expertise immediately available or the wherewithal or means to undertake the calculation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem with this amendment is essentially the same as with the previous group. It would place the burden of calculating the investor's tax charge on the issuing company, but only when the proceeds are £50,000 or less. It is far from clear how that could be justified. How would the company calculate that chargeable amount when it would need to know for how long the investor had held the security? How would the duty be enforced on the issuing company, which may be a foreign company? Once again, I fear that the amendment qualifies as being well intentioned but impracticable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that, with this amendment, I have not got hold of the wrong end of the stick again.<br><br>
Amendment No. 151 relates to the definition of the word "debt" as contained in the Insolvency Act 1986. The amendment deals with events of default other than those that result from pure insolvency. An example of such a default might be the failure to pay interest on another debt owed by the company. The problem is how to achieve a succinct definition of such debts. It has been felt that the Bill's definition is not sufficient to cover all circumstances in which insolvency might arise—for example, it does not cover the insolvency, not of the issuer, but of a subsidiary, sister or parent company. I hope that the Minister is satisfied that the amendment would rectify that deficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) did not address any of his remarks to amendment No. 152, to which I wish to speak.<br><br>
Clause 49 states that a security shall not be regarded as a deep gain security—which is normally less desirable for both issuer and investor—if a deep gain would only materialise on an early redemption caused by the issuer failing to comply with the terms of the issue of the security, or becoming insolvent, or being taken over.<br><br>
We do not object to the clause's basic premise, because the normal deep gain rules would apply to a deep gain arising in some other way. However, it is possible that some ingenious tax planners might use the clause to arrange for securities that ought to be deep gain securities to cease to be so by imposing on the issuer artificial conditions which he is certain to break.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
In that way, the realisation of tax avoidance would be ensured and the deep gain regime escaped.<br><br>
Amendment No. 152 would nullify the strategy by which the avoidance of the deep gain regime is deliberately sought by the imposition of artificial conditions that seek a tax advantage. We considered tabling an amendment on this point, but decided that that possibility was remote and that close monitoring was preferable to a specific amendment.<br><br>
Some people attempt to arrange their affairs to avoid the deep gain regime. Will the Government either accept that amendment or monitor carefully what happens when people fail to abide by conditions or use the regime for tax avoidance.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To respond to the question asked by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), the caluse does not cover all possible force majeure events, but it deals with the principal provisions that appear in the terms of issue of existing securities. This sensible and reasonably comprehensive list parallels the provisions that apply to qualifying indexed securities elsewhere in the deep gains schedule.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) is right to draw attention to the avoidance possibility. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland attempts to incorporate an anti-avoidance provision, but if clause 49 were amended in that way, it would create uncertainty as to whether a particular force majeure provision was admissable. The amendment contains a subjective element.<br><br>
Clause 49 provides a high degree of certainty. It allows issuers to make provisions for redemption at a premium in the circumstances to which such arrangements usually apply. A bond does not become a deep gain security provided that any redemption clause is wholly at the issuer's option—rather than that of the investor or the trustees—or that the amount payable docs not constitute a deep gain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) for omitting to speak to amendment No. 152. The Financial Secretary accepted the possibility of an avoidance loophole. He did not say whether he considered it a serious possibility. He said that the amendment would cause uncertainty. Does he believe that some other plugging measure, which would remove that abuse with greater certainty, should be introduced later?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I meant to imply that amendment No. 150 opened up the possibility of wider abuse by extending the scope of admissable redemptions. The Opposition attempted to close that gap, but did not succeed without causing uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow what the Financial Secretary says. The unamended clause contains the possibility of an avoidance loophole, which should be plugged. But those matters could be raised more appropriately later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
QUALIFYING INDEXED SECURITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 39, line 42, leave out "10" and insert "5".<br><br>
Amendment No. 89 is a probing amendment. Why was the 10 per cent. figure chosen? Clause 50 deals with qualifying indexed securities which cannot be deep gain securities and are therefore relieved of the taxation regime that applies to deep gain securities.<br><br>
One of the seven conditions that a security must fulfil to be a qualifying indexed security is that it is either indexed in a given way to the retail prices index or issued before 8 June 1989, quoted on that date and indexed to a stock exchange index such as the FTSE 100. The provision could be said to be tailor made because the issue was raised in detail and with lucidity in our debate last year by the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor).<br><br>
Clause 50 allows a security indexed to a stock exchange index that has been issued after 8 June 1989 to be a qualifying indexed security provided that it was quoted at the time of issue. However, another condition that must be satisfied is that the interest payable on the security and the amount on redemption must be indexed "precisely and without restriction". Clause 50(4) relaxes that requirement if the terms of issue guarantee that the amount payable on redemption will be 10 per cent., or less, of the issue price—a 90 per cent. loss of principal. Why is that provision necessary? An indexed security should be indexed precisley and specifically to the chosen index. Will a bond issue become more attractive if the issuer guarantees that a lender's loss will be restricted to 90 percent.? Why have 10 per cent. rather than 5, 15or 50 per cent? Clause 50(4) attacks no real, practical existing problem. If the Government have something in mind, they should tell us. We are mystified as to how 10 per cent. was chosen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to this probing amendment. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the normal presumption is that a qualifying bond has to reflect the value of the index over the whole range of potential values. We received representations that it was theoretically possible for the underlying index to reach zero and for the bond not to constitute a debt. To ensure that it would constitute a debt, there must be a floor redemption value. The figure at which that floor is set is arbitrary—we chose 10 per cent. as a good round number, but it could be 5 per cent. or 15 per cent. People do not buy bonds anticipating that they will go down in value, but they need the assurance that bonds will at all times constitute a debt for other and extraneous reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's admission that the figure is arbitrary. However, as he

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
has shown that the principal is not affected by the arbitrary nature of the figure, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise one brief point on clause stand part. Clause 50(7) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The amendments made by this section shall be deemed always to have had effect."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the entire clause is retrospective in application. Why is such sweeping retrospection included in the clause? Why are the amendments to have effect not only for securities issued after Budget day, but for any securities issued before then? We have speculated that perhaps the Inland Revenue has already identified issues for which the clause deliberately has a retrospective implication. If so, we should like to know. Will the Minister tell us briefly why this provision is in the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks a good question, as is his wont. Although no specific cases are known which make this retrospective provision necessary, it is inserted for tidiness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary did not have much notice of that question, but an issue of principle is involved. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) has done the Committee a service by drawing our attention to subsection (7) which had escaped my notice.<br><br>
This is a sweeping measure and I do not believe that it complies with the Rees rules. Lord Rees, as he now is, set out rules in the late 1970s when we had the misfortune to be under a Labour Government who were inclined to introduce retrospective legislation. Lord Rees established criteria against which any proposal should be judged. There can be circumstances in which it is necessary to have retrospective legislation, but there must be good justification for it in each case.<br><br>
I know that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has had this matter sprung upon him, but we are entitled to a slightly better explanation than the one he gave. Perhaps we should consider bringing forward an amendment on Report to leave out subsection (7), unless there is an improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Support comes from unusual sources. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will recall that last year we discussed at length retrospection in tax legislation. Opposition Members accept the principle that in general, retrospection is not to be undertaken, although particular burning issues where there has been severe abuse may justify its use. However, we would never say that such a sweeping retrospective provision should be included in a clause simply for tidiness. I cannot accept that as a sensible reason for including retrospection in tax legislation and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
I hope that the Government will think again about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if my response to the question was rather too succinct, but I assumed that everyone in the Committee realised that we were talking about a relieving provision, not one that would retrospectively put an onerous burden on people. Under the Rees rules, relieving provisions can be as retrospective as one likes. In any case, the clause does not affect the start dates of the various provisions and no past tax bills would be affected, so it is cleared under the Rees rules on another point, because the clause refers only to future events relating to securities, regardless of when they were issued in the past. There is no reason to hold over my head the sword of Damocles of an amendment on Report. Obviously, I accept that any mention of the word retrospection rightly touches sensitive nerves in all of us. Hon. Members will want to look at my words to make certain that I was not acting as heinously as the impression my first rather brief answer may have conveyed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not entirely accurate in claiming that this is a relieving provision because strict conditions are included in the clause which must be met if relief is to be achieved. The important issue is the nature of those conditions, so I would not describe it as a matter merely of providing relief. Furthermore, the Minister has not dealt with the point that the clause contains a start date for the new qualifying indexed securities of 8 June 1989. Even for the sake of neatness, tidiness or any other justification that he might offer, it is not necessary to have total retrospection for ever. He amplified his earlier answer and we shall look carefully at what he said. We may want to return to the issue, but we do not believe that that part of the clause was carefully or well drawn.</span></p>

DEEP DISCOUNT SECURITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in clause 51, page 40, line 26, after "'it", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that this subsection shall not apply if at each such dale the yield to maturity in relation to the security in question (as defined in paragraph 1(1)(1H) would be the same".</p></blockquote>
First, I apologise to the Committee for the fact that the amendment is slightly technically defective because it refers to (1H) when it should refer to (1h). Nonetheless, it can usefully be discussed.<br><br>
Clause 51 deals with the deep discount securities regime. Normally, to make it work there must be a fixed redemption date and price. Only then can the fixed yield to maturity on the bond be calculated and, along with it, the interest element for each year which the issuer may deduct in his tax computations. Accordingly, where there arc two or more possible redemption dates and prices, it is usually impossible to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
say what the yield to maturity is and to what deduction the issuer is entitled each year.<br><br>
At present, it is probably the case that bonds of that type qualify as deep discount securities, provided that the discount is deep whatever redemption date is chosen. The clause appears to be an attempt by the Inland Revenue to get rid of the problem by saying that such bonds cannot qualify as deep discount securities at all. Deep discount securities can perhaps best be regarded as a legalised form of tax deferral. In principle, we wish to limit their availability.<br><br>
We support the general thrust of clause 51, but in one instance the evil which the Inland Revenue seems to be aiming at does not exist. Amendment No. 90 deals with when the yield to maturity is the same, whatever redemption date is chosen. Therefore, the issuer's tax position would always be known. We accept that, when there are two possible redemption dates and the yield is uncertain, the provisions of clause 51 should apply, but they are unnecessary when there are two possible dates and the yield is known.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I shall cite two brief examples to illustrate my argument. A security that should be caught by the provisions might be issued on 1 January 1991 at £1 million and redeemable either on 1 January 1994 at £1,423,821—a yield of 12.5 per cent.—or on 1 January 1996 at £1,842,435—a yield of 13 per cent. The issuer's tax deduction for 1991 would be either £125,000 or £130,000 and, for 1992, it would be £140,625 or £146,900, depending on which redemption date was eventually used. That state of uncertainty is undesirable. One option would be to give the lowest possible duduction and, if necessary, catch up on redemption. However, the Government have chosen the other option and have provided that that security cannot be a deep discount security. Broadly speaking, we agree that, in such circumstance, that should apply.<br><br>
The second example concerns a security which is issued on 1 January 1991 at £1 million and is redeemable either on 1 January 1994 at £1,442,897 or on 1 January 1996 at £1,842,435—in either case at a yield to maturity of precisely 13 per cent. In the first example, the yield would be cither 12.5 per cent. in the four-year period or 13 per cent. in the six-year period. In the second example, the yield would be identical at 13 per cent. over either period. Whatever date the security is redeemed, the issuer's tax deduction would be known to be £130,000 for 1991, £146,900 for 1992 and £165,997 for 1993. Accordingly, there would be no uncertainty because, whatever redemption date was used, the yield would be the same. There is no reason why such a security should not continue to qualify as a deep discount security.<br><br>
I hope that those two examples have helped the Committee to identify the precise point at which our amendment is aimed. When there is genuine uncertainty and a potential difference in yield between two redemption dates, we agree with the provisions of clause 51, but when there is no uncertainty and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
yield is identical even though there are two possible redemption dates, the provisions should not apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am attracted by the elegant mathematical symmetry of the hon. Gentleman's proposal. We all have our sources of emotional satisfaction and mine comes from mathematics. However, I am dissuaded from accepting the amendment. Deep discount bonds with multiple redemption dates are virtually unknown in practice. Interest in them arose only because of the possibility of avoiding the deep gain rules. The caluse closes that potential loophole and the hon. Gentleman would not wish to re-open it. His amendment is unnecessary because no one really wants such securities other than for tax avoidance purposes, and if they did, the amendment would not achieve its purpose. Many complex amendments would be required and the result would defy the hon. Gentleman's overriding purpose of restricting the complexity of the Bill. The amendment would add to its complexity for limited gain. Despite my admiration for the hon. Gentleman's mathematical facility, I do not recommend that the Committee accepts the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the amendment is technically defective, to some extent, the Minister's argument for the need to reduce complexity in this area of taxation. However, we have perhaps flagged an area for possible future consideration. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

"(1A) Where any person carrying on a ring fence trade, in consequence of a demand pursuant to an agreement binding that person and one or more others in relation to the exploration and operation of an oil field, pays an amount to another person (whether or not the operator of the field) in circumstances such that it is unlikely that any appreciable part of the payment will later be returned to him. that payment shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as abandonment expenditure incurred at the time of the payment by the person first above named, where it is paid as a contribution towards the future costs of closing down of. or any part of, an oil field by way of the demolition of machinery or plant which has been brought into use for the purposes of that trade and which is or forms part of an offshore installation or a submarine piple-line; and where this subsection applies, subsection (5) below shall apply with the necessary modifications.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(1B) Subsection (1 A) above shall not apply—
<ol>
<li>where the person in question has an interest in the oil field of 15 percent. or more, or</li>
<li>where the main reason, or one of the main reasons, for the making of the demand or the payment was the obtaining of a tax advantage for that person.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
As we move from deep gains to the deep seas, the Committee will be conscious of the passage of time and will wish to proceed with alacrity. However, it is important to make several points because they cover matters of considerable national interest.<br><br>

We are anxious that the oil tax regime should be guided by various principles. Amendment No. 138 and amendment No. 139 which we shall discuss later, are shaped by that anxiety. We wish to avoid the distortions and anomalies that have arisen from the piecemeal way in which the oil tax regime has come into being and the way in which the three oil taxes—royalties for the pre-1982 fields, petroleum revenue tax and corporation tax—relate to each other. The various reliefs applicable to them are fraught with hazards in terms of anomalies and distortions. It is important that those anomalies and distortions are ironed out to achieve fiscal neutrality.<br><br>
The second principle is that we should maximise the yield to be obtained from an enhanced overall level of production from the oil fields and recognise the contribution to be made not only by large operators, but by small operators. Both should be encouraged by the taxation regime to maximise their yield.<br><br>
That brings me to the third principle. It will be especially important to safeguard the environment when abandonment operations take place in the North sea. The implications of abandonment on the environment must be taken into account. Our amendments deal directly with those three principal concerns.<br><br>
When discussing amendment No. 138, it is helpful to study all the provisions that deal with the oil industry and petroleum revenue. They do not seek to deal with the petroleum revenue tax treatment of abandonment expenditure or the deduction of such cost for royalty purposes. They allow 100 per cent. deduction, for corporation tax purposes only, of all abandonment expenditure and a three-year carry-back if it cannot all be used in the first year. That is achieved in clauses 52 and 53. Clause 54 would allow petroleum revenue tax repayments to be taxed for corporation tax purposes when received, and not for the years that the original petroleum, revenue tax deductions were claimed. Finally, the provisions allow for the interest on the petroleum revenue tax repayments to be capped. We broadly welcome all those measures, but our amendments deal with our three principal concerns.<br><br>
We are worried about the new relief in clause 52 for abandonment costs because it give no additional quantum of relief in that area, but relief such as is currently available faster and allows it to be used more effectively. We welcome the extension of the relief. Under the old system, if an operator in the North sea closed down his operations and incurred abandonment costs, he would not have received relief because he would have ceased to trade when he incurred those costs. New section 62B, introduced by clause 52, ensures that such costs will be regarded as having been incurred on the last day of trading, so as qualifying for relief. Unfortunately, the new relief favours major operators in the North sea with large fields who arc best placed to use the 100 per cent. allowance immediately and who will no longer have to use it over several years. Abandonment relief will not be increased for a small field that may have been in decline for some years and may not have made corporation tax profits for several years. Small fields
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
pay no petroleum revenue tax due to the operation of oil allowances. A distortion appears in the existing regime as a result of the interplay of various forms of taxation. The reliefs and allowances available work against the interests of operators of small fields who get no effective relief for abandonment costs.<br><br>
Will the Financial Secretary consider whether it might be worthwhile to extend the carry-back period for abandonment costs to allow the recovery of earlier payments of corporation tax? Although the traditional period for carry-back is three years, would it not be right, bearing in mind the anxiety about the environment and the maximisation of output, to encourage some marginal fields to stay open slightly longer by extending that period beyond three years? Otherwise, there would be a temptation to shut down those marginal fields earlier to maximise the amount of corporation tax repayment.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
The Minister should consider that argument. We hope that he will have a positive response to give to the industry's small operators, in relation to which amendment No. 138 is designed especially, but not exclusively, to bite. Hon. Members who are interested in such matters will know that small operators are often required, under joint venture agreements, to put money into a joint fund to guarantee eventual abandonment costs. That is quite right. The public demand that protection of the environment, and the industry has demonstrated its responsibility by giving it readily. However, there is no tax relief on the money that is placed in those special funds set up by the joint venture agreements. The major fields are not affected by that, as they are able to place the same sums in parent company guarantees to ensure that eventual abandonment costs are paid, but the minor fields need to put by cash or, more expensively, buy bank guarantees. No tax relief is available for those payments until abandonment is underway, even though the money has effectively been spent. Amendment No. 138 would mean that such payments would qualify for relief before they were used by the joint venture in demolishing the fields assets.<br><br>
Because we recognise that there is a potential for abuse, we have included an anti-avoidance restriction and a limitation on use to participators with an interest of less than 10 per cent. The amendment draws attention to a particular problem for the small operators, and we urge the Committee to accept it.<br><br>
We arc aware of the context of the debate about the oil industry and petroleum tax revenues. Suitably chastened by my experience of quoting figures earlier this afternoon, I hesitate to go into numerical detail about the present industrial context, although 1 am sure that it must be in order in this Committee to quote such figures verbatim. They show that oil taxation yields in 1984–85 totalled 9.5 percent. of total taxation, at around £ 19 billion. Yet the IFS has predicted a figure of under £5 billion per year in the 1990s. Our total fuel trade deficit was 15.4 million tonnes in the first 10 months of 1989, giving a total of approximately 18.5 million tonnes for the whole year. That is a turn-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
around from a surplus of £6.42 billion in 1986 to £76 million for the first 10 months of this year. Taking into account the fact that £220 million was spent on energy from France, we are in deficit for the first time. That is a cause for anxiety. We must ensure that the provisions that we are debating will maximise the use of available resources. That means extending the life of marginal fields, encouraging small operators and, at the same time, protecting the environment. Bearing in mind those arguments, we urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to supplement the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). The 100 per cent. allowance for corporation tax against the costs of abandonment of united Kingdom offshore oil and gas fields is important. In principle, we all want proper provision for the industry to abandon its platforms. The ideal would be a clear seabed policy—the complete removal of all parts of the platform and its associated works after clompletion of the extraction.<br><br>
The oil industry has already had a profound impact on the ecology of the North sea—an impact that should not be allowed to outlive the industry. We must put things in perspective. It will be many years before the major North sea oil fields are exhausted and their facilities are no longer required.<br><br>
At present, the only case in the United Kingdom continental shelf where the government have had to consider an application for abandonment is, of course, a result of the tragic Piper Alpha incident two years ago, but we are not just dealing with the immediate short term—we must also provide for the future. Clause 52 and some of the Bill's other provisions do not go far enough. The Untied kingdom Offshore Operators Association is worried that the three-year carry back permissible under clause 53 does not go far enough. The Association wants a five-year carry back.<br><br>
My worry is rather different—that there is too little incentive for companies to ensure that oil fields arc exhausted before they arc abandoned. That is an important matter. We should do nothing to encourage operators to close fields down too early. An operator may be inclined to close a field because of the Bill and the allowances it makes available, yet it could still be profitable, oil or gas remaining to be extracted. The decision might hinge on the benefits afforded by the environment allowance. Valuable oil or gas production could be lost as a result. In view of the importance of our energy resources, that should not be encouraged. Surely hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to avoid premature abandonment and to maximise recovery of oil and gas resources. Unfortunately, the Bill will not achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is useful and I hope that the Minister will respond to it positively, even if he cannot accept it, and take on board some of its points. It is worth stressing the importance of the oil industry to the country and to constituencies such as mine. As
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) suggested, abandonment will not have to be faced in the immediate future. It is important that fields arc continued with as long as there arc reserves that can be brought to the surface at a reasonably economic rate, which is what the amendment would ensure.<br><br>
Concern has been expressed, particularly by the fishing industry, that abandonment should not be carried out haphazardly. When the oil industry began its operations in the North sea, it sited a number of platforms in what were previously fishing areas and, as a result, fishing activities were cut off. In the long term, the fishing industry would like a total clean bed policy so that it could again fish grounds that had once been fished. I suspect that that will not be possible, but everything that can be done by way of tax incentives to help clean up the North sea after the oil industry has ceased its operations can only be good for the ecology of the North sea and those whose livelihoods for many centuries to come will depend on fishing its natural resources. These measures, with others that we have not yet reached, are particularly welcome in achieving that end.<br><br>
The amendment would help the small independent companies whose contribution to the development of North sea oil assets is not praised enough. They have played an important role in the development of the North sea and the help that the amendment would give them would be welcome..<br><br>
My maiden speech in 1983 was on a measure designed to help the oil industry and to encourage the further development of resources. The petroleum royalties relief measure was introduced that year and has successfully stimulated oil production. At the time the industry was complaining that in the previous nine years it experienced 13 changes in the tax regime. Since then, there has been much greater stability. Different aspects have been treated seriously by the Treasury and proper consultation with the industry has taken place.<br><br>
We are approaching the period of abandonment. I welcome the measures in the Bill that will allow it to be done to maximise the development of existing reserves. After the oil industry has gone, the North sea, which will be with us for ever, should be restored as well as possible to its natural state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the broad welcome given to the abandonment measures by the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) and other Opposition Members, although they obviously have their own ideas for further improvement. The hon. Gentleman made a couple of general observations. He said that we arc allegedly in deficit on oil, but I understand that that is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in deficit in energy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Energy is more difficult to measure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) spoke of the need for an incentive to ensure that oil fields arc exhausted before they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0098">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
abandoned. I would put it slightly differently. It is important to remove artificial disincentives, which is the intention of many aspects of these provisions. We want to remove fiscal factors that might cause artificially early abandonment, and we believe that we shall achieve that objective.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) and for Glasgow, Central referred to the need for a clean bed policy. Clearance requirements will be set by the Department of Energy under the Petroleum Act 1987 powers and in accordance withinternational guidelines. It should not be the objective of the Finance Bill to try to influence that. A legally obligatory abandonment expense will be met by these fiscal provisions.</span></p>
<p>7</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary and I are not at odds on this, but I think that this is a matter for the Finance Bill, as a tax regime can be set. The intention of these measures makes it more likely and more feasible for a clean seabed policy to be implemented. If the tax regime can help that, people in the industry are more likely to be willing to carry it out.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those in the industry do not have to agree; if it is law, they just have to do it. [Hon. Members: "Ooh!"| That is the normal understanding of the law. The purpose of this measure is to ensure that when they are compelled to do something, they get tax relief. My point is that it is the Committee's job not to try to lay down the precise clearance provisions that should apply, but to ensure proper fiscal treatment. That comes under a different legal provision.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brent, South put forward the case for tax deductible alientated funds. He recognised what many people do not, namely, that there is no overall fiscal gain from such funds. They give front-end relief instead of back-end relief, and the net outcome on a discounted basis is exactly the same. He suggested that other side effects would make them beneficial for small companies. I acknowledge that, but we believe that there are disadvantages with alienated funds. For that reason, I reject the amendment.</span></p>
