<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
<p>[Continuation from col. 926]</p>
<p>8.30 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned, unanimity was breaking out. We had two excellent speeches, one from each side of the Committee, in support of the wide-ranging group of amendments on clause 41 which, by and large, urged local authorities to consult in the preparation of their plans. I wish to speak specifically about the ones on housing.<br><br>
In a nutshell, the amendments write into the Bill the expectations that are quite clear in the White Paper and in statements by Ministers. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) quoted from paragraph 5.7 on page 42 of the White Paper. There is an even earlier reference on page 6, which says that
<br><blockquote><p>"local authorities will be expected to produce and publish clear plans for the development of community care services, consistent with the plans of health authorities and other interested agencies."</p></blockquote>
They can only do that if they have first consulted the health authorities and other interested agencies.<br><br>
At the weekend I was reading a speech that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health made at a conference organised by INSIGHT and Community Care. She referred to the framework that will need to be in place by April 1991 and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It should identify the needs of local population; set strategic objectives and priorities for meeting them and set targets for collaboration with other agencies … Local authorities will also be expected to show 'how they have involved service users and carers in their needs' and plans will need to broadly fit in with those of the local health authority and Family Practitioner Committee."</p></blockquote>
The amendments convert the exhortations of my hon. Friend the Minister into a specific obligation in the clause. In clause 41 as drafted the local authorities have to consult with no one at all when they draft their plans for community care services. That clearly is at variance with the whole philsophy of the legislation, which is to make the service more consumer-oriented and to involve those who provide the care in the drafting of the plans. The amendments therefore impose an obligation to consult, but some of them also provide the forum in which such consultation might take place, with a specific proposal for a committee set up by the local authority with a specified composition.<br><br>
Some two weeks ago I spent an evening attending a meeting of the Ealing community care forum, which is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 928</span>
exactly the sort of organisation envisaged by the amendments. The meeting was attended by representatives from such organisations as Age Concern, Help the Aged, Mind, the Carers National Association, the local housing associations and community health council—exactly the sort of people who need to be involved in the assessment of need and the drafting of plans. The sorts of people who would attend that meeting and who should attend any meetings on community care know more than almost anyone else the shortcomings of the existing system—its inflexibility and its extravagance at times, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent has referred. They have an invaluable fund of knowledge about the present scene.<br><br>
Such people also have a clear perception of what should happen in April 1990. They have a clear insight into the needs of the clients whom they serve and they are broadly in sympathy with the philosophy behind the Bill, which is to have consumer-oriented packages of care rather than obliging people to take what is currently available.<br><br>
They also have an interest because many of them are service providers. They would like to provide the sors of services that are envisaged themselves, to bid for the contracts and, they hope, to win them. It would be very short-sighted if local authorities did not consult the sorts of organisations in the sort of forum that I have outlined if they are to make a success of the policy. There is a valuable resource in there, and a Conservative administration has alrady done much to bring voluntary organisations into the planning machinery. The joint consultative committees and the partnership committees set up in the inner cities have representatives of voluntary organisations on them, and it would be very odd if we let the Bill go through without ensuring that the voluntary organisations were part of the decision-making progress.<br><br>
I touch briefly on the role of housing associations. There are four paragraphs in the White Paper on housing, and one could say that not enough emphasis was placed on the role of housing. Without bricks and mortar there is no community care. Paragraph 3.5.4 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Social Services authorities will need to work closely with housing authorities, housing associations and other providers of housing of all types in developing plans for a full and flexible range of housing."</p></blockquote>
That is why two of the amendments place a specific obligation to consult housing authorities and housing associations.<br><br>
Housing associations will be crucial, not only in the provision of housing generally, but also in meeting some of the needs envisaged in the White Paper. Already many housing associations such as Stonham, Leonard Cheshire and Carr-Gomm in London are meeting the special needs that are targeted under the legislation, and they should be part of the decision-making process so that they can explain to the social service authorities what they can provide and what they need. Many housing associations are increasingly meeting the needs of the elderly, people with disabilities, people leaving long-stay hospitals, people with AIDS or HIV, people at risk of domestic violence and young people leaving care, and it is essential that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0855">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 929</span>
involve those organisastions in the decision-making process.<br><br>
The Minister may say that of course they anticipate such organisations being involved but they do not seek to put it in the Bill. If it is not to be in the Bill, we need to be satisfied that there will be some other way of obliging the local authorities to indulge in this process. Otherwise they might take a few short cuts, simply consult the statutory bodies and leave out the enormous resource in voluntary organisations.<br><br>
I am relatively relaxed about the ways in which we meet the objectives, but I am convinced that we must in some way ensure that social service departments go through that consultative exercise before they commit themselves to the plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) said in suggesting that the amendment merely write into the Bill some of the fine words of the White Paper and give them legal standing. I should be a little less relaxed about the alternative of being assured in some other way that they would be given legal standing in the Bill. If something is written into the Bill and is there in the law, there is a necessity for it to be observed and it cannot be changed by a change of administration or Minister. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to that point and incorporate some of the amendments in the Bill rather than giving bland assurances in search of the withdrawal of the amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 27 is very relevant when taken with the points made about the housing sector. It says that local authorities
<br><blockquote><p>"shall consult with service users, both directly"—</p></blockquote>
and I underline "directly"—
<br><blockquote><p>"and via their representative community and voluntary organisations, in drawing up their plans."</p></blockquote>
I wish to refer specifically to the basic need of the elderly and of disabled people for a home, which is not the same thing as a house or a roof over an individual's head.<br><br>
I agree wih the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton that there is not enough about housing in the White Paper. But amendments Nos. 603 and 605 are perhaps even too modest and do not go far enough. If they are taken with amendment No. 27, which refers particularly to consultation with direct users of the services, carers and their representatives, they begin to mean something in terms of the way in which we deal with housing need.<br><br>
We have been given many examples over recent months and we come across many examples in our practical, day-to-day experience, both as Members of Parliament and previously, about the way in which the needs of those who will use the service are often overlooked in the planning of services. The 1988 DSS report concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"The low level of priority afforded the service [for the deaf and hard of hearing] was clear and senior managers generally demonstrated little knowledge or understanding of the work. The lack of intelligence and analysis of factors influencing the development of provision was noticeable."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 930</span>
That is not a criticism of the professionals dealing with those tasks. It merely reflects the fact that those who use the services and the carers who live and work with them, who know what the needs are, can help to translate those services into services that meet the needs of individuals. We must not expect overwhelmed professionals to deal with the translation of users' needs; consultation with those people should be built in as a requirement, not as an afterthought.<br><br>
I call in aid the terms of the circular issued by the Welsh Office—I notice that that brought a freshness to the eye of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales—which seeks to recommend ways in which the White Paper, and subsequently the Bill, should be implemented. I refer to "Caring for People: Community Care in the Next Decade and Beyond", the draft planning guide issued by the Welsh Office on 26 January.<br><br>
Before commenting on the circular, I should say that it is difficult to understand how any Minister could contemplate—I hope that no Minister will—rejecting amendment No. 27, as it is so modest and so much in line with what is expressed on the Government's behalf. Indeed, the overall philosophy paragraph, which appears as annex 1, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Welsh Office, local authorities, health providers, including General Practitioners, housing agencies, the private sector and voluntary organisations to work together in partnership to provide those elderly people in Wales and their carers in need of care and support with the necessary services to enable them to lead, as far as is possible, full and independent lives in line with their wishes in their own homes or in 'homely' settings within the community."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to accept the obligation—set out in his own cirucular—to partnership and consultation, and to write them into the Bill. He should make them a legal requirement on others as well as on himself. The Minister says; it is there in his circular; now he must put it into action by accepting the amendment.<br><br>
The obligation being placed on local authorities through a circular of this sort will deliver to the Welsh Office a wealth of human experience and advice, which it needs if there is to be a comprehensive plan for elderly and disabled people which delivers their day-to-day needs.<br><br>
I am worried that this may not happen in practice, given the housing needs of those affected by this part of the Bill. I asked the Secretary of State for Wales a series of questions; I am sure that the points that I am making in respect of Wales are paralleled in England and possibly also in Scotland. I asked about the way in which the needs had been determined, what sort of analysis had been made, the process that had gone on and the categories of accommodation that had been identified. The reply given by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in his usual helpful way was:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government attaches high priority to the provision of all types of special needs housing."</p></blockquote>
But he went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is for local authorities in conjunction with other housing providers to assess current and future housing needs within their areas. It is esential that housing authorities play a major role in the production of social care plans as part of the care in community strategy to assist this process."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 February 1990; Vol. 167, c. 9.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0856">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 931</span>
That is fine as far as it goes, but that answer ignores the involvement of users of the services themselves and carers in the process.<br><br>
8.45 pm<br><br>
I am sure that, if asked, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary would agree that it is important for them to be involved. But it does not spring to the front of the mind, and it did not spring to the front of the mind of either the Parliamentary Under-Secretary or whoever drafted the reply for him, otherwise it would appear in that answer.<br><br>
The elements of consultation for which amendment No. 27 argues should be part of the Bill so that it becomes as natural as breathing and it is automatic in a local authority for a civil servant or a Minister to say, "We have got to answer that requirement of the Bill in the way that we respond in every matter that comes before us." That is why it is important for it to be built into the legislation.<br><br>
Referring specifically to the housing need element again, I looked at the draft circular, particularly with regard to disabled people. As I have said, it is not just a case of roofs over heads or even roofs with easy access over heads, but of accommodaiton needs of all the people. In the circular the Welsh Office says
<br><blockquote><p>"that social plans should be prepared and published by social services authorities."</p></blockquote>
So far, so good.
<br><blockquote><p>"They will be expected to produce the plans jointly with health authorities and family practitioner committees, and in consultation with representatives of voluntary and private sectors, housing authorities and housing associations—the latter working within supporting guidance set out by Tai Cymru. In preparing the plans they will be required to take carefully into account also the views of users of services."</p></blockquote>
I have two questions. How will it be guaranteed that that is an essential part of the process, as required in amendment No. 27, and how will it be done?<br><br>
Page 9 of that same circular gives cause for some concern when it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the first instance, authorities' housing strategies should contain a clear summary of the achievements proposed for each client group for the financial year following the one in which the HSIP is submitted."</p></blockquote>
That is all right as a piece of planning language and as a requirement laid down in the planning process where we are number crunching on future requirements. But I am concerned at the danger of classifying people into a box labelled by age and a particular form of disability, and failing to realise the flexible and personal nature of the service that is needed.<br><br>
The same circular goes on the following page to refer to the timeframe:
<br><blockquote><p>"Plans should cover a 3 year period; that is, the first plans should cover the years 1991/92 to 1993/94 inclusive."</p></blockquote>
But there is a need for great flexibility to meet the individual requirements of the individual disabled or elderly person. That is the most important point of all. I illustrate it by reference to the case of Colin Griffiths
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 932</span>
of Penarth, whose mother came to see me in my surgery a couple of weeks ago. Colin is a tetraplegic following a recent tragic accident. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There appears to be a Welsh sub-committee going on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your protection, Dame Janet. I was referring to the case of Colin Griffiths of Penarth. Colin tragically became a tetraplegic following an accident in which he received horrific injuries. I thought that his mother was coming to see me because of the housing problems and need for adaptations and help for him that the family was experiencing. I though that a church elder was coming to see me with her because he was concerned to raise funds. In fact, they came because they were determined that Colin should live the independent life that he wants. In coming to see me they reflected his determination—and we are talking about an individual with horrific injuries—to do something for others in his own situation. He was concerned about other young tetraplegics and he demonstrated that he had a will to have the maximum possible independence for himself and wanted to help others to do the same.<br><br>
Anyone involved in the planning or housing processes would have made the assumptions that I made before I talked to Colin and his family. Despite being a tetraplegic, he wishes to live an independent life and help others in the same situation. He also wants to see an expansion of voluntary and statutory services that will help people like himself. His attitude reflects the importance of specifically referring back in the Bill to users of services and the carers who deal with them day to day.<br><br>
There is a question of cost within community care systems, because if Colin is to live an independent life he will need 24-hour care. However, he wants to be independent and not be a drag on his family and on carers, who will become elderly as time goes on. There is therefore a need for the service in housing as well as in other aspects of care to be properly funded, flexible and set within structures that deliver a proper understanding of the needs and aspirations of disabled and elderly people.<br><br>
That is what care in the community is all about. It is not just about putting people into a box that is perhaps more suitably shaped than boxes have been in the past. It is about seeing those individuals as people with specific needs and as whole human beings. In the past people in Colin's position had the alternative of a Cheshire home or a geriatric nursing home. In recent years the Welsh Office, local authorities and the voluntary sector have worked together for respect the disabled. I acknowledge the way that that has worked in Wales and pay tribute to it because it has brought together all those sectors as equal partners trying to find a way forward. It still has some way to go in listening to the voices, individually and collectively, of the users of services and the carers. That is the direction in which the Griffiths report was taking us, and if amendment No. 27 and the amendment of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton are accepted, an important step forward will have been taken.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0857">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 933</span>
The young man to whom I have referred has the determination and necessary family support to manage his own affairs, and the significant point is that he wants to manage his own affairs. There should therefore be built into the Bill a right for him to be consulted and involved. It is important to involve people like Colin Griffiths in his own future, and people in representative groups have the knowledge and experience to do that. Without that, the planning process will be arid and will fail to meet personal needs.<br><br>
I appeal to the Minister to accept amendment No. 27 as well as some of the other amendments in the group. Let us build consultation in to the Bill so that it can be guaranteed in the planning processes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support a number of amendments in the names of Opposition Members and amendments Nos. 774 and 775 standing in my own name which give the Government an option of looking at ways in which the consultation procedure takes place when social services departments are drawing up plans for community care.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will recall that I raised the issue of consultation, especially with voluntary organisations, with her on the Floor of the House. She said then that the Government would consider ensuring that there was proper consultation between social services departments and voluntary organisations. I am grateful to the Minister for giving me through the Welsh Office a copy of the document that the Department of Health has produced. It shows that the idea of consultation is being carried through. We welcome that document but, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) said, we should also like to see a provision on the face of the Bill.<br><br>
Committee members have laboured under the difficulty of seeing how the Bill squares with the White Paper and how the latter squares with ministerial statements. That process is even more difficult for those carrying out the process—the social services departments, voluntary organisations and the independent sector. The Government's plan for social services departments needs to be examined. The White Paper says that those departments will act not only as direct providers, but will develop purchasing and contracting roles. That means that they will become enabling authorities. Social services departments will not provide services on their own, but will look at other ways to provide them, in which case there must be collaborative planning.<br><br>
I am not trying to repeat the ideological battle for the amendments, which took place earlier. An ideological gulf divides the Committee. There cannot be an absolutely level playing field anywhere. There has to be an emphasis. The Government believe that the private sector should play an increased role, and the local authorities a reduced role. The Government should be honest and admit that. Some of the sedentary comments by Conservative Members make plain the Government's aims, and are in line with what the Opposition have been saying.<br><br>
I have not put the intellectual or ideological arguments because the clause will be accepted. However,<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 934</span>
we expect the necessary collaboration to achieve the aim to be written into the Bill. The social services departments in my own constituency held two one-day conferences at which the voluntary sector and the health authorities come together. Those groups know that they have to collaborate if community care, as described in the Griffiths report and in the Bill, is to work. They have started to identify the areas of difficulty that have to be addressed.<br><br>
The voluntary sector has said that it is supplementing the work of local authorities. It is providing not a complete service, but part of a service.<br><br>
9 pm<br><br>
Under the Bill the voluntary sector will be expected to provide the whole service in some areas. That gives it greater responsibility, which gives rise to two main considerations. The first is the resources that will be available to the voluntary sector under the provisions of the community care proposals. The voluntary sector needs to know in the planning stages, when it is talking to local authorities, whether it can discharge its new functions. According to the White Paper, if there is no voluntary or independent involvement in a local authority area, the Government expect the local authority to stimulate it. In other words, if there is a gap in the provision, local authorities are obliged to fill it by stimulating voluntary and independent sector participation. In those cases it is even more necessary for the voluntary sector to be involved at an early planning stage. The voluntary sector is therefore asking itself whether it will be satisfied with the resources that will be available to it to carry out its duties under the procedures.<br><br>
Secondly, hitherto the voluntary sector has been asked to supplement the activity of social services departments, but the new responsibilities will call for new skills. Who will provide the training for the new voluntary sector involvement? It is essential that training is discussed at the planning stage.<br><br>
It is essential for health authorities and those involved in primary health care to be involved as well. That is happening in several areas, as the Minister knows. The example that I gave from my own area has been repeated elsewhere. We have heard examples from other members of the Committee. We want the Government to go one step further and tell the Committee that they are prepared to put into the Bill a commitment to collaborate and consult. After all, consultation means that one will not necessarily take everything on board. It will be the local authority's plan, and it will be statutorily responsible for it. It is therefore necessary for the Bill to oblige local authorities to take in the voluntary sector at an early stage.<br><br>
One of the benefits of early planning is that it identifies the gaps in the service. In Gwynedd, we have found that there are gaps in the voluntary and statutory agency sectors which we can begin to fill. It is no good if the gaps are identified when the plan is in place, because as the statutory agency—the local authority—begins to discharge its functions and finds those gaps, the service that it provides will not be the first class one that is essential for the elderly and disabled.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 935</span>
The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) referred to ethnic minorities and the need for the plans that are being prepared to take account of their needs. In parts of Wales there is also the linguistic issue. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales will confirm what I say. It is essential in those areas of Wales where Welsh is the main language that the plans that are being prepared deal sensitively with the issue. It is not an issue on which there is a black or white answer.<br><br>
Wales is a multilingual community, where people who speak different languages have different needs, and it is important to identify them. Among many elderly people, the first and, in some cases even today, the only language is Welsh. They have a right to have services through the medium of that language. The Secretary of State says that the patient is king. If that is so, the needs of the patient should be met in terms not only of delivery of care but the language that is used. People in the private and voluntary sector should receive that care in their own language.<br><br>
Finally, I commend to the Minister a quotation from an excellent document prepared by Dr. Norman Vet-ter at the centre for health studies at the Welsh school of pharmacy in Cardiff. He wrote about the new approach to community care which is enshrined in the ideas of Sir Roy Griffiths. Speaking about the Griffiths approach he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Such an approach will require professionals and non-professionals working with elderly people to acquire new skills, mostly because of the need to learn a little of each others' skills, and the most difficult skill of all—listening to what others have to say."</p></blockquote>
In the light of those comments, it is important for the Minister to assure us that the Bill will include a requirement for consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this move to debate the community care plans, which are a vital aspect of the Bill. We set out the purpose and contents of those plans in great detail in the White Paper, and no hon. Member who spoken has underestimated their importance and significance. Particularly encouraging is the extent to which such good progress has already been made. Most speakers have spoken about authorities of which they have experience or organisations with which they are concerned that have already made good headway and are thinking through how they will respond to this major opportunity.<br><br>
It is a new world. Fifteen years ago I became the vice chairman of an organisation called the National Council for Carers and their Elderly Dependents. That has now become the Carers National Association, and I resigned the moment that I appointed a particularly high calibre director in the form of Jil Pitkeathly. The Carers National Association and many others involved in caring, have offered guidance to many of us on the Committee and the association often offers help to the Department. It makes a major contribution which is taken seriously across the country. Recognition of the role of carers enshrined in the White Paper and of all our proposals for community care is a major step forward.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), who has particular knowledge and experience
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 936</span>
in this area, spoke about the practical importance of discussing provision with service users and carers before plans are fixed. I have referred already to my visit to Birmingham last week, and the point made then was that often when one speaks to service users and carers, it is not necessarily more of a service that they want but provision of the service in a different way. What they need is information and reliable and practical services. We have every reason to believe that local authorities welcome the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to plan and provide services to bring people together and to harness the goodwill of those in their area to provide for this important group.<br><br>
There is contention because we are reluctant to write on the face of the Bill the precise mechansims for consultation and to state precisely which groups should be considered. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) referred to the Welsh language problem in his area. Should something like that be enshrined in the Bill? There is a danger—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that it should be enshrined in the Bill. It is the sort of thing taht should be included in the planning procedures of local authorities and voluntary organisations. If the Bill included a consultation procedure, such matters would be provided for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comment. It exemplifies what could happen if groups, organisations or procedures were specified. Instead of being a framework for making community care plans, the Bill would become a straitjacket. We want people to think broadly about their communities and to undertake their task in a creative fashion. They should not feel that they are working through a check list and that when they come to the end of it the job is over and done with.<br><br>
Groups have been mentioned and I endorse the need to keep in close touch on the matter of housing, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) suggested. I welcome back to the Committee my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims). His amendment was moved admirably by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Kent. In making community care provision, health and housing authorities must collaborate with relevant groups, but it would constrain provision rather than enable it to be made if the precise requirements were enshrined in legislation.<br><br>
We shall follow the excellent example of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Wales and issue a consultation document on community care plans. I commend the Welsh version to members of the Committee. It is a consultation document and is open to discussion. Our consultation document will take into account the views of members of the Committee, of directors of social services and of local authority associations. Heeadway is being made within the Department in discussing with those groups the best way forward. We want to ensure practical, effective community care plans, taking all aspects into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's reference to the Welsh Office circular is highly relevant, especially in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0859">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 937</span>
relation to amendment No. 27. That document reflects the need for amendment No. 27, as a statement of the principle, to be incorporated in the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that there is an overwhelming necessity to write it into the Bill. The importance of consultation and working with groups in the community is endorsed throughout our discussion of communtiy care plans. It is in the White Paper and in the guidance. It would be inappropriate to include in the Bill an organisation such as the community care advisory committee or an elected body, or to specify formally the groups that should be consulted. However, hon. Members are entitled to ask what safeguards there are. They may say that the words are fine but want to be sure that there are powers to transform them into reality. My reply is that the guidance is important because of the flexibility that it offers and because it allows local innovation and diversity. There are safeguards because under clause 44 the Secretary of State has a direction making power to call for reports. The SSI, too, has an important role. The hon. Member for Monklands, West referred to the recent SSI report on disabled people. It has a major part to play in monitoring community care plans and the development of the service after 1991.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Member's will understand why I am reluctant to accept the amendments. We do not want to write on the face of the Bill who should be consulted. Hon. Members's contributions will be taken into consideration in the guidance.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I accept my hon. Friend's desire that the Bill should not necessarily include a formula for a certain percentage of different kinds of consultee. I hope that as the community care policy develops, there will be a growing transfer of responsibility for expenditure from the direct hand of the local authority to user groups. There is no reason why the increasing sophistication and self confidence of user groups should not be translated into responsibility for considerable sums of public money. In many cases they would make better use of it than other people.<br><br>
Let us suppose that a local authority—through incompetence, ideological anxiety, or simply because the director of social services crossed some consumer representatives—was guilty of a dereliction of duty because it did not consult. How will it be possible to convict that local authority of an offence if the Bill does not state that local authorities should consult? I am edgy about relying wholly on the good will of the Minister—in whom I have full confidence—and on guidance, which may not be sufficiently strong to constitute a standard against which to measure dereliction of duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will have direction-making powers. He can call for reports and issue directions. The guidance as set out will be backed by his powers and his ability to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is short and simple. The Minister gave reasons why certain proposals should not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 938</span>
include the simple principle outlined in amendment No. 27, which fits the Minister's expressions of concern and intent. The amendment states that a local authority
<br><blockquote><p>"shall consult with service users, both directly and via their representative community and voluntary organisations, in drawing up their plans."</p></blockquote>
That would not limit or constrain the local authority or bring about the dangers that the Minister mentioned. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, the only interpretation can be the Government wish to escape a legal responsibility to consult service users, directly and via their representative community and voluntary organisations, in drawing up their plans. That would be such a terrible admission that I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ian Grist)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that the mental handicap and mental illness strategy for Wales does not depend on the statutory provision that he calls for? Nevertheless, what he asks for is carried out under those strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I referred to those strategies and to the failings of the draft planning document that the Under-Secretary circulated, which misses out that point, despite it being Government policy and despite it being in the White Paper to which Ministers pay tribute left, right and centre. Why will not the Minister accept the simple proposition that local authorities should be required to consult service users, both directly and via their representative community, and voluntary organisations in drawing up their plans?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to what my hon. Friend the Minister said. She seemed to say that of course we want local authorities to consult, but that we do not need specific amendments, because too many of them specify either forms of consultation or people to consult. She said that we have reserve powers under clause 44, by which we can make local authorities consult, if they do not do so. On re-reading amendment No. 27, I believe that it would be better to write into the Bill that they should consult, rather than to rely on reserve powers that will be activated when it is too late.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister reflect on amendment No. 27 between now and Report? I think that I am right in saying that one of the local government Acts placed an obligation on local authorities to consult with business users before the uniform business rate was fixed. That was a precedent for local authorities to consult. We could have an academic argument about who are the business users, but we have overcome that in the legislation. If local authorities are obliged to consult with business users before fixing the UBR, I do not see why they should not be obliged to consult with service users before drawing up their plans for the community organisation of care.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister reflect on existing precedents to consider whether there is a way of writing the proposal into the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution. The key point is that amendment No. 27
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0860">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 939</span>
refers to consulting service users. We have all agreed that that is important, but it is important, too, to consult housing authorities, health authorities, carers, voluntary organisations and the independent sector. My worry is that by specifying one group we would imply that that is the most fundamentally important one, as opposed to a range of others whom we believe it is important to consult. I shall continue to consider the matter as we proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand my hon. Friend's argument about not writing such matters into the Bill. The entire and central thrust of legislation is that it should deliver a better service to the consumer. I should gladly give up all the other organisations to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred if we could write into the Bill a demand that local authorities should consult consumers. for that reason, I shall vote in favour of amendment No. 27.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In many ways, it has been an astonishing debate. The Minister did not respond to the strong feelings and logic of the Bill, the title of which includes the words "Community Care" but excludes the community from consultation. Instead of participative democracy, local plans will be imposed on people, including service users, without their having a say in the provision of those services.<br><br>
I am not convinced that plans should be imposed in that way. Clearly, other members of the Committee feel the same. The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) introduced an interesting Welsh dimension. I thought that we had made it clear, in the most gentle way possible, that the report from the Department on the non-implementation of a Bill, which is essentially about consumers, was absolutely devastating.<br><br>
The Minister did not mention the report. She made a brief reference to disabled people and that was it. Such vagueness at local level about drawing up plans is entirely unacceptable, even when we know the main thrust of the Bill. I accept that when considering other amendments, people may have thought that the drafting was wrong or unclear. But this one is clear, crisp, uncomplicated and consistent with what we are told is Government strategy, so we would be failing in our duty if we did not ask the Committee to accept it. I ask the Committee to accept it, or to have a Division, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I am in some difficulty as amendment No. 27 is not my amendment, although I moved the lead one in the group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 27 is one of a large group of amendments that we have not yet reached. It has been discussed because we have grouped them. We must now decide the fate of amendment No. 717, which I understand was moved by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), although I was not in the Chair at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. I apologise for not knowing the exact procedure. Given my hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 940</span>
Friend's clear remarks that she expects local authorities to consult widely, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I wonder whether you, or the Clerk, could guide us to the point in the running order when we will reach amendment No. 27.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the order in which it is printed in the amendment paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that that you could help to point out where that is, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The page no. is 664. It is an amendment to clause 41. If the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is anxious that we vote on it, I shall make a note now and call it formally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that it would come in after amendment No. 590, which I do not think will be moved, and just before amendment No. 28.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I try to help hon. Members who wish to move amendments formally, if they give me advance notice. It will be easier for me than anyone else to check when we get there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to tell my hon. Friends and other members of the Committee that they have made their position clear. I have said that there is a strong, overwhelming commitment to make the community care plans an effective tool and that consultation is a fundamental first step in the provision of plans. In view of the strong views expressed by my hon. Friends, I shall reconsider the amendment and come back at a later stage when I have thought through an appropriate way forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Rowe, do you wish to seek leave to withdraw the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of my hon. Friend's clear commitment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 941</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not make heavy weather of the amendments, which deal essentially with timing. Under amendment No. 501, the terms that are published for the provision of community care would last three years. I hope that there will be no difficulty in accepting that proposal. It is lifted from the White Paper entitled "Caring for People", paragraph 5.10 of which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In particular social service authorities will be expected to set out … their strategic objectives for community care in the next three years and how these relate to national policy objectives".</p></blockquote>
9.30 pm<br><br>
That three-year commitment was repeated in the speech to which I referred a few moments ago, it is now in the safe hands of <i>Hansard,</i> so I cannot quote from it yet. A three-year plan would be of specific value to voluntary organisations in that the associated packages of care that go with it would give them more certainty than a one-year plan.<br><br>
The consultative process that has already started will reveal a vast scale of need that has not yet been met. It will not be possible, in year one, for local social service authorities to meet that need. It would be helpful if local authorities could show over two or three years that provision was being built up to meet that need. Furthermore, it would be reassuring for all those concerned if there was a three-year plan which was moving towards the target that we all want to achieve.<br><br>
Amendment No. 503 makes a minor drafting point. If the Secretary of State is to ask local authorites to publish either new plans or modifications to their current plans, that should be carried out prior to the financial year in which the plans become operational. If the plans are published or modified halfway through a financial year, clearly difficulties will arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), but we are reluctant again to set down in statute the precise timing arrangements for the plans. The guidance will outline exactly what that planning should be. As my hon. Friend knows from the White Paper, we envisage a three-year planning overview and we want to give the Secretary of State enough flexibility to call for plans between certain times. The guidance will deal with the matter. It is important that the plans of local authorities coincide with the financial year. In that way, they can be used as a useful tool in the planning of services and their relationship with resources, and the implications that may arise form that. For those reasons, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be unchivalrous of me not to respond to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Minister. I have a modest amount of good will, a substantial part of which I have already run down in the post-dinner sitting. However, against my hon. Friend's clear explanation why it would be wrong to have a three-year plan written into the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 942</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 502, in page 41, line 34, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the national objectives for community care services published under section (National Standards and Objectives for Community Care Services)"."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take new clause 10—<i>National standards and objectives for community care services—</i>
<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) The Secretary of State shall publish and from time to time review a report on the national standards and objectives for community care services (in this section referred to as the report).</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Before publishing or reviewing the report the Secretary of State shall consult with such organisations as appear to him to be representative of local authorities, the users of community care services and their carers, voluntary organisations providing community care or housing services and people of ethnic minority origin.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) The Social Services Inspectorate shall examine local authority plans for community care services and the provision of services under those plans and shall have regard to the report in undertaking such examinations.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Implicit in the giving of responsibility to local authorities is the possibility of differences in the level of care and how it is delivered. A lively local authority set up could not be established unless we accept that there would not be strictly uniform standards across the nation. However, many people in need of community care would not accept wide variations in the quality of care that they can expect. It is clear that the Government have accepted that premise because they have published, for example, national guidelines for the conduct of residential homes. They have also stated that they are prepared to produce national guidelines on a number of other issues.<br><br>
Part of our intention in tabling the amendments is to ask my hon. Friend the Minister for Health to make it clear that the Government will maintain their distinct and unequivocal commitment to raise the standard of community care across the nation. Another of their objects is quite straightforward and I briefly touched on it earlier. There are groups in our population whose needs are discernably special, but whose numerical weight is freqently too small to command premium attention from a local authority. That is true of people who suffer from alcohol dependency. Many of them and their families spend a large amount of time in trying to conceal their problems from other people and often from themselves as well.<br><br>
Many ethnic minority groups have often individual problems. I shall not try to single them out because a member of an ethnic minority is as much entitled to expect individual attention to be given to his or her problem as anyone else. There are also collective problems, especially with newly arrived groups, which are clearly discernible as worthy of special attention. Part of the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that such groups are not overlooked and that their special needs are properly catered for in the provision of the community care plan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I find myself in a position which is similar to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and other members of the Committee. Our clear intention is to provide a high standard of community care. The role of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0862">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 943</span>
the social service inspectorate in monitoring community care plans and the power of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to call for reports or to issue directions are mechanisms for ensuring that standards are maintained. Particular groups will not be overlooked and I hope that we can satisfy my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent that we intend to reach the national objectives of community care that were set out in the White Paper. As I have made clear throughout our proceedings, our investment in producing guidance and promoting high standards is not confined to the Department. Many academics and voluntary organisations are examining the range of the provision of care throughout the country.<br><br>
To write a further requirement into the legislation would be an additional unnecessary formality because of the monitoring ability of the social service inspectorate and the right of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to call for reports and use his direction making powers. However, I thank my hon. Friend for having drawn the Committee's attention to the importance of consdidering the national perspective as well as the local and immediate one.<br><br>
I hope that my comments will have satisfied my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a service were developed in a local authority area for people who have multiple handicaps, such as those who are deaf and blind who form a tiny proportion of the population, can we be sure that, under the new system, every effort will be made to generalise the excellence of that system? At present, many such services are developed in isolation and they remain isolated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is enormously important to highlight good practice and to condemn bad practice. Too often, hon. Members know when there has been a disaster or that a local authority has not behaved as we would wish. I agree with hon. Friend that it is important to spread good practice and I shall think about further ways in which we can ensure that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I note the grouping of the amendments, but I intend to speak specifically to amendment No. 28. Amendments Nos. 272 and 757 propose the publication of an annual report to Parliament. That is important, but it offers the encouragement of review as a spur to performance and, in my view, that is not good enough.<br><br>
On the other hand, amendment No. 28 would be a positive, creative and even vital step towards enabling people to take charge of their lives. It is basic to the concept of care in the community that people should be able to control their destinies, and, to do so, they require information about what is available to them.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
The amendment would require the local authority to
<br><blockquote><p>"'publish information for the public, service users and carers on the range and quality of services to be provided, how and where to apply and how and where to complain.'."</p></blockquote>
That requirement sounds so simple that it might be taken as being obvious, but anyone with any experience of users of services will appreciate how complex it can be to find the right service and the right place to complain.<br><br>
The White Paper states that local authorities should make their community care plans public documents. The amendment would ensure that the information that is vital to the consumer is public, and is published with the purpose of being available to and understandable by those who have to use the service.<br><br>
Under current provisions, it is difficult for the consumer to know what services are available and where to complain should a service be of an inadequate standard. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have referred to inadequate services, and I should therefore expect the amendment to commend itself to all members of the Committee.<br><br>
The problems will become worse under the Government's proposals, which are intended to result in a wider variety of service, and it is therefore all the more essential that people should be able to find their way around.<br><br>
If they reject the amendment, the Government would be saying that the prime responsibility for finding out what services are available and what is missing would rest with the public, the service users and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 946</span>
carers. That, surely, is unaccetpable. For all those people acess to services depends on information and information depends on professional contact. So far as I am aware, no local authority has a concerted policy on information for users of services or their carers.<br><br>
I commend to the Minister a good report from the Wales carer's campaign, with the title, "The Idea and the Reality." I hope that the Minister is already familiar with the document, as it illustrates the seriousness of the matter and the confusions that arise.<br><br>
If an individual needs help, which of the professionals involved is to provide the signpost to the required service? Is it the general practitioner? Is it the social worker? Is it the health visitor? Is it the district nurse, or the community mental handicap team member or the social security officer, or the citizens advice bureau? I have been involved with the CAB for many years, and I know that the bureau is all too often the residuary where all those responsibilities end up because no other body has the full range of knowledge. The information could come from any one of the sources I have listed.<br><br>
Similarly, how and where does someone using the service complain? Unless he or she knows the way round the services it can be difficult to know where to start. Every Member of Parliament, in his surgery, has met people who have come with complaints that seem straightforward, but who do not know where to start to look for solutions. The lack of knowledge is all the more important when we are dealing with elderly and disabled people.<br><br>
In the past couple of weeks members of the Committee have been speaking about the way that things can go wrong in the public and the private sectors. There msut be clarity about where to go to make a complaint or to ask for help.<br><br>
In the Wales carers' campaign report—which I would commend also to United Kingdom readers—there are three specific recommendations. The first is the idea that social services departments and health authorities should make all carers and service users fully aware of the services. One must agree with that as a point of principle, but that requirement must be delivered, which is why we have tabled the amendment to write the words into the Bill. It is a requirement that could be demanded by users, enforced by the Secretary of State and delivered by the local authorities.<br><br>
The campaign had two other specific requirements: first, funding from the Welsh Office for a Wales carers' handbook, so that there could be a document giving the signposts, which would be of use not only to users of the service, but to carers, professionals, the local authorities and the Welsh Office.<br><br>
The other suggestion was for a pilot project in one or more counties to test and develop information systems. I am more concerned with the delivery of information systems to young people which take a great deal of time to meet the needs of those who were meant to use them. We do not expect things to be done overnight. But we do expect a response from the Department of Health and the Welsh and Scottish Offices. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0864">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 947</span>
amendment would give a valuable instrument to the carers, their families and to the responsible Secretaries of State.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us what has been happening? There should have been developments. Those matters have been brought into the public view. But people are only told about the services that the professionals know about. Often, professionals are isolated. For example, unless they have a wide-ranging interest in people's needs, GPs may not be aware of the services available. Professionals may come only once across individuals such as the young man I mentioned earlier. They may have common factors, but each situation needs to be dealt with separately. A knowledge of the services available is required if the services are to be targeted as individual needs.<br><br>
Many people needing such information have little or no access to professionals. Often, people caring for the elderly will approach a social service department. Unless they are lucky, they are unlikely on their first attempt to find a fully informed person. They may retire uninformed simply because individuals and receptionists cannot be repositories of all knowledge. Specialist information should be available to fit individual needs.<br><br>
Over many years, I was involved in inter-agency work, cutting across health, social work, education and other agencies. Year after year, there was a constant need for renewal of information and contact. It does not happen once and remain in perpetuity; it needs to be renewed. It needs to be set in the Bill as a touch-stone.<br><br>
There is a need for continual renewal. The obvious does not work unless the context is created in which it can happen. People need help—nearly always in crisis situations. Carers approach professionals because they need something immediate. Disabled and elderly people approach professionals because illness and affliction exceed their capacity to provide normal care.<br><br>
Whether disabled and elderly people get help depends on their condition, where they live, the structure of the local authority and their luck with their professional contacts. We need to guarantee the availability of information as well as services. People need to understand the services available. They need to be published. That is a simple and logical progression.<br><br>
Even if the Secretary of State allocated responsibility for communicating the information to one profession, keeping up to date would be a problem. People in the caring professions have a wide range of experience to impart, but information dissemination is not part of their training. The process should not be left to chance.<br><br>
The carers' report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Only in one health authority and one social services department in Wales were interviewees"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the people surveyed—
<br><blockquote><p>"aware of any general update service or in-service training for staff, and then only on social security benefits."</p></blockquote>
Benefits represent only a small part of the requirements of the individual. The report continued:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 948</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"South Glamorgan has recently appointed a carers' information worker under the aegis of the Welsh Office elderly initiative but the worker has reported that it often takes a long time to pull together all the relevant information on available services."</p></blockquote>
If the task is left to one communicator it will be a matter of pushing a stone up a hill, whereas if there is a basic requirement in the Bill for the local authority to act in the context of its departmental responsibilities there is a chance that information will be available to those who need it.<br><br>
The report also describes how Gwent has developed a computer-based directory of services for people with a mental handicap and Powys social services department has produced an A-Z of services for people with a mental handicap. The latter was a personal initiative rather than the result of corporate policy. Described as having been written in a couple of hours one afternoon, it represents no real investment in a coherent information service, however worthy the intention.<br><br>
In a community work context I have been the person who pulls together information in that way, so I know how time-consuming an occupation it is and how vital it is that the process is part of the local authority's strategic planning. It must be included in the local authority's description of its services and of those of all other agencies operating in the area. The amendment would achieve that.<br><br>
In a text written for the King's Fund in 1984 Maureen Oswin wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"Methods of getting information to parents about formal care facilities are very inconsistent. It depends very much on local developments and the interest and enthusiasm of individuals and professionals who want to be involved."</p></blockquote>
After five years of the Government's programme of care in the community carers in Wales feel that that description still reflects current reality.<br><br>
The Spinal Injuries Association says,
<br><blockquote><p>"The problmes will be exacerbated under the Government's proposals as they are intended to result in a wider variety of service provision."</p></blockquote>
Variety is good only if one has a map to show the variety of options open. Without such a map choice is not a reality.<br><br>
There are two requirements for an adequate system. First there must be a legal requirement in the Bill. Secondly there must be the resources. Resources will be provided from the local authority or the Department only if the Bill requires the information to be made available. With no mechanism in any county in Wales to inform professionals of available services, even carers in regular contact with care professionals may be unaware of, and therefore denied access to, support services. They are victims of a vicious circle of mutual ignorance. I ask for a requirement to publish to break that vicious circle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Does my hon. Friend agree that failure to get the provision right would not even save money? The relationship between the carer and the disabled person could break down and they could both end up institutionalised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is true. My hon. Friend has come to the kernel of the problem. Knowledge is power, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0865">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 949</span>
unless knowledge and information are placed in the hands of users, carers and their representative organisations, we shall not be able to break that vicious circle of ignorance. I trust that the Minister will take a small step towards breaking the cycle by accepting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Amendment No. 757, in my name, would require the publication of an annual report so that local authorities' achievements in identifying and meeting needs will be known both locally and nationally. A composite picture would be built up across the country to enable Members and Ministers to evaluate the position and make better-informed judgments on the pattern and delivery of care.<br><br>
Among the items that I have specified for inclusion—</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.15 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Fifteen minutes after the break, I shall keep my remarks brief. They were going to be brief enough at 10 o'clock. I was telling the Committee about the heads of items that I should like to see included in an annual report. They are perfectly straightforward, as hon. Members and the Minister will see from amendment No. 757. They would provide information about the level and nature of identified needs; about identified needs that are not being met—that is extremely important—and about the use of resources, contracting, and the quality of services. I hope that the Minister will concur that that would be an extremely useful means of ensuring an adequate flow of information, particularly if the report were to be made available on a statutory basis.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister has found the amendment. I always become panicked at this time of night because on a previous occasion in this Committee, at about this hour, I moved an amendment and it became clear that the Minister and I were not talking about the same amendment. None the less, we did a good job of politely exchanging views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It was a good debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am glad that the hon. Gentleman thinks that it was a good debate. He spotted the trouble coming that evening long before many of the rest of us.<br><br>
A report containing the information to which I have referred would be made available to all those involved—the voluntary organisations, the statutory authorities, the service users and the carers—so that we may have integrated and co-ordinated an approach as possible. I hope that the spirit if not the substance of the amendment commends itself to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I can see the intention behind the amendments: hon. Members want more information to be provided. The hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 950</span>
Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) spoke at length abut the carers' handbook—the Wales carers' campaign report—and I shall look at it myself. I assume that it is a further example of the efforts that are already being made to provide necessary information. There is no doubt that carers respond better when they know what is available. The provision of information is fundamental to providing and improving the service.<br><br>
As to the question of including requirements for the provision of information in the Bill, we have already made it clear that local authorities will be required to produce and publish their community care plan. That will be an important tool and will provide a great deal of information about the services and how the planning has been undertaken. In addition, they will have to make clear the arrangements for assessement, which we shall discuss later this week, and for complaints procedures. The comments of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) about the precise information that he would like to see in the report to be produced by local authorities will be further matters for consideration when we bring forward our guidance on communtiy care plans. To go into such detail in the Bill would be inappropriate and would lead, inevitably, to a reactionary process. In terms of providing information for carers and users, the annual community report will be a force for good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Amendment No. 272 states that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall annually lay before Parliament a report on the progress made by local authorities".</p></blockquote>
I assume that in this important area of her responsibilities, my hon. Friend the Minister will want Parliament to have such a report once a year. I should simply like her to say so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:When we were discussing the powers of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and the role of the social services inspectorate, I made it clear that the inspectorate would have powers to monitor standards, issue directions and provide guidance. It is not our intention to lay down a formal requirement to report to Parliament annually. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will want to satisfy himself, throught the social services inspectorate, that good practice is being undertaken and will be disseminated, but without the formal requirement of an annual report to Parliament.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 41, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) where a plan has been agreed by the local authority and the district health authority and a philosophy of services has been accepted, the local authority may refuse the registration of residential facilities for community care if the additional provision proposed does not fit in with the agreed care plan.".</p></blockquote>
I tabled the amendment to help promote the best available care for vulnerable groups of people in respect of whom the local authority and the district health authority have already agreed and adopted a philosophy of care. Those two expert bodies are already working closely and have developed a care
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0866">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 951</span>
plan that takes into account the individual needs of certain groups. I believe that the local authority should have the statutory right to refuse unsuitable private development that would upset the agreed plan and be detrimental to vulnerable clients.<br><br>
I tabled the amendment because of a local situation which has disturbing implications for the care of mentally handicapped people. Recently in my constituency, private developers submitted plans to the local authority for building a 40-bed nursing home for people with a mental handicap. The co-operation between the local authority and district health authority in Calderdale has greatly improved the living conditions and quality of life of those people. The authorities have set out clear guidelines for all those caring for that group of people, which have been followed with exciting results. The planning application runs directly counter to those guidelines and the agreed care plan.<br><br>
People with mental handicaps are not sick; they do not need nursing. They have many problems, but being treated as sick in a nursing home will not help them. Historically, people with mental handicaps have not been treated equally or accorded normal human dignity. We are now supposed to be much more enlightened about caring for them.<br><br>
The planning application was initially turned down by the local authority on planning grounds. But the developers could appeal to the Department of the Environment. We know from past experience that the Government favour business over community interests. So the decision to refuse the application could be overturned.<br><br>
The site is unsuitable for caring for the mentally handicapped. It is 100 yards from the Sowerby Bridge main sewage works and until recently was used as an industrial and domestic waste tip. It is virtually an island, with a canal on one side and a river on the other. I would not want to live in a private house there, let alone build a nursing home. The brown rat population there has massively increased. That has dangers for people in good health.<br><br>
It would be madness to move those patients to that site. It is isolated from shops and the local community. There are no amenities there. The design is inappropriate for mentally handicapped people. The planned building would have narrow corridors. People in wheelchairs would find it difficult to move about inside the building, and almost impossible outside. They could not perform unattended simple tasks such as shopping. The site smells bad. Passing it has sometimes made my eyes water. Planning permission has been refused, but without the amendment there is every likelihood that it will go ahead.<br><br>
The local philosophy of care supports the use of the small, family-sized home. Such homes should be dispersed throughout the community. We already have-some good ones. The mentally handicapped hospital in question is being progressively phased out. It is situ-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 952</span>
ated on a moor. It is isolated and the patients should be moved. If the scheme went ahead it would interrupt the plans of the local authority and the good progress that has been made in moving the patients into the community so that they could lead some sort of normal life. We would swap a public for a private institution.<br><br>
This important amendment would stop such schemes, which are unwanted by local people, patients' relatives and the residents of the mental hospitals themselves. That development contravenes the locally-agreed care plan, which has worked well and has given mentally handicapped people a good quality of life. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I support the amendment because my own local authority is worried about the problem of dual registration. The authority has a residential care policy that allows a maximum of about 40 beds in homes. The local authority has the sympathy of the area health authority and the planning authority but there is nothing in the legislation that could solve the problem. While those authorities are in sympathy, they are lukewarm about trying to enforce something that is not enforceable. A 62-bedroom, part-residential scheme is proposed for a site where a 32-bedroom home already exists. It is planned to build a 32-bed nursing home in Thurnscoe hall where there is a 40-bed nursing home. There are plans to build a 40-bed residential home and a 61-bed nursing home in Valley Part, Wombwell, and in Church St., Royston, there are proposals for 60-bed nursing home and a 40-bed residential home. That is not acceptable and does not bode well for the care of aged persons. The amendment would help local authorities, because people who proposed to build residential homes would adhere to the local authority plans rather than evading them by making a dual registration application.</span></p>
<p>10.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:We are indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon). She highlighted the difficulties of connecting the registration powers over local authority residential homes and health authority nursing homes with the planning system. In a small part of my constituency there are 1,000 people over 75. Planned accommodation tends to be concentrated in particular parts of cities and neighbourhoods. If we allow that to continue, we shall recreate the problems of the large, long-stay hospitals in which people become disconnected from networks of relatives, friends and neighbours. Community care should be based near those networks. How does the Minister visualise dealing with that problem? The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) and I have discussed it before, as his constituency is not unlike my own. He is familiar with the pattern of concentrating residential homes in certain neighbourhoods, thus taking advantage of sites and housing patterns, especially large terraced housing. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands the need to avoid those large concentrations of residential and nursing homes and that he will explore mechanisms to prevent that. Facilities

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 953</span>
should be properly distributed across cities and local authority areas. People who find themselves in residential care should be able to maintain their community and neighbourly connections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I hope that you had an enjoyable visit to north Wales, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It was most agreeable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) is right to say that his constituency and mine share some similarities. He has identified the point that his hon. Friends were trying to make, but the amendment would restrict the development of private sector residential accomodation and is therefore not acceptable.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the process by which large, turn-of-the-century houses are converted into nursing and residential homes. That is taking place in my own neighbourhood. The homes are private and the people who own and run them must attract custom. Unless they sell out to the completely open market, the Bill will oblige them to seek contracts from the local social service authorities, who in turn will ensure that residential care clients are placed in accomodation that is close to their homes, relatives and neighbours. Private investors who ignore that requirement will not get the local authority contracts and will go out of business if they cannot attract clients in some other way. The private sector takes that risk, and the restrictions proposed by the amendment would only confuse the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That reply acknowledges the problem but advances no mechanism for solving it. How does a local authority provide a reasonable distribution of facilities across its area? How can it avoid concentrating facilities in some neighbourhoods?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I suggest that the amendment would provide no solution, as it restricts the number of private residential properties that are available. The local authority would have even less choice about the placement of patients or clients.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Minister draws attention to the amendment's deficiencies, but he has not defended the deficiencies in the armoury of measures that the Bill makes available to local authorities. Apart from the community care plans in clause 41, the Bill contains no mechanism to achieve the legitimate goal of preventing the concentration of such facilities in certain neighbourhoods. How can local authorities give a positive guide to private development? They may have planning powers, but they are limited. A planning application cannot be refused on the ground that, although a location meets traffic and road safety requirements, it already contains too high a concentration of a particular provision.<br><br>
Similarly, a local authority's powers of refusal under registration relate to quality. But we are discussing the location, not the quality, of provision. There is a gap in the system. We are trying to ensure that some neigh-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 954</span>
bourhoods do not become flooded with a type of private residential provision to the detriment of other neighbourhoods, to which clients and patients may belong and from which they will be cut off. How is that problem to be solved? The Minister keeps on acknowledging it, but offers no solution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I do not want to go on and on, but the hon. Gentleman entices me to do so. I mentioned contracts, which would cause the privater sector to expect that the requirements of specific areas would be met through local authorities. Housing associations, and voluntary agencies would also be involved in joint care plans. Difficult questions cannot be answered overnight, but we are talking about an ongoing programme and an ongoing policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am puzzled by the Minister's answer. Is he really saying that part of the system of contracts provided for in the community care plan could accommodate the possibility of a local authority saying, "We wish the private sector to make provision in the east end rather than the centre of Newcastle for community care" and being able to engineer a situation whereby further requests to provide accommodation in central Newcastle could be refused and deliberately directed to the preferred area in the east? No such mechanism is provided for in the Bill. It is precisely its absence that has prompted my hon. Friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I would have appreciated a proper reply to my serious arguments. Restriction to the private residential sector makes the provision unacceptable to Opposition Members. The Minister gave a pathetic answer. He acknowledged the existence of problems but gave no answer to them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) rightly said. I shall raise the issues again later. For the Committee's convenience, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, wihdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 714, in page 41, line 40, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) shall, in addition, in the case of local authorities in Wales, establish procedures for consultation with every other relevant local authority in Wales in pursuance of those duties laid upon them by virtue of sections (a), (b) and (c) above and jointly submit to the Secretary of State for Wales annually a document giving a strategic view of the community care needs and services in Wales.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(e) shall, in addition, in the case of local authorities in Wales, submit from time to time to a Standing Conference of Statutory and Voluntary Agencies convened for the purpose such care plans as determined by sections (a) and (d) above for review and professional audit."</p></blockquote>
May I reflect the spirit of courtesy with which the Minister noted your welcome return to the Committee, Dame Janet. Rwy'n falch i glywed eich bod wedi mwynhau eich ymwcliad â gogledd Cymru ac wedi dod yn ôl i'r pwyllgor heno.<br><br>
Once again, I rise because I wish to help the Government to make the legislation workable and sensible to those whom it affects. The amendment would provide a framework for co-operation and consultation within

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 955</span>
Wales. It proposes a workable pattern with due flexibility and responsiveness to the Welsh context.<br><br>
Wales has specific needs. The Welsh Office as well as the Welsh local authorities have specific responsibilities. Social service and health matters overlap, but the Welsh Office fulfils the function of regional health authorities. That is why the pattern suggested in the amendment should be accepted.<br><br>
In the few days that it has been publicly available, the amendment has received ready support from a range of organisations, including the Social Care Association, the Welsh branch of the British Association of Social Workers, the Welsh Association of Community Health Councils, the Welsh Council for the Disabled, the Welsh Carers' Alliance and Age Concern (Wales)—and that without a real canvass. That has been a genuine response to the amendment. It demonstrates the positive value of the structure that it proposes for Wales. Indeed, it has also been commended by other organisations such as the Association of Directors of Social Services and the Spinal Injuries Association.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to guarantee that local authorities and the Welsh Office will consult and plan strategically. Nothing is wrong with having that principle enshrined in the Bill. Indeed, clause 46, which relates to Scotland, goes down the same road to some extent. The principle is both accepted and legislated for. Guidelines are issued by the Welsh Office and it is expected that there will be a structure of consultation and involvement but that expectation has no statutory force unless the amendment is accepted.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
It is clear that plans for the elderly and the disabled need to be both local and strategic throughout Wales. The guidance notes, which are informal, say that the social services authority should formulate a plan to meet local needs and then pass it to the Welsh Office. That is not good enough. The Welsh Office also has a responsibility to judge the adequacy of collaboration and standards achieved. The amendment gives real force and effect to the Government's own stated objective of planning to meet both local and strategic needs, of ensuring effective consultation and of integrating the service.<br><br>
Paragraph (e) of the amendment ensures professional audit and the involvement of statutory and voluntary bodies in the whole process which is the only way that a strategy can take on real meaning and permeate all levels of the service in Wales. If all local plans are determined aside from a process which assesses strategic needs and meets strategic requirements that cannot work.<br><br>
Paragraph 7 of the Welsh Office guidance describes a separation of strategic community care plans into separate compartments both geographically and by social need which is directly contrary to the whole direction of change which the Bill, the Griffiths report and the White Paper are about. Paragraph 7 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Social care plans should therefore concentrate on other client groups, namely people who are elderly, people who have physical or sensory disabilities and people who are suffering from chronic or terminal illnesses … who need care in domiciliary settings."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 956</span>
That contradicts clause 41(l)(a) which requires an integrated local plan which includes the mentally ill and mentally handicapped. The direction of change should take us first to integrated planning, secondly to care in the community and thirdly, to meeting real needs. Often an individual falls into several categories. Individuals do not fall into just one category when they require care, but several, and they often cover from one to another. A mentally ill person grows old and an old person can become mentally ill. There are many examples of movement across the boundaries and of inclusion in more than one category. Provision for that is missing from the Bill and the guidance notes from the Welsh Office.<br><br>
If community care means anything, it means integrated personalised responsive services. I have already underlined the word "responsive" and the need for individual plans if care is to be what it sets out to be. That is not what is set out in the planning guidelines for Wales. paragraph 8 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is vital, nonetheless, that social care plans should be fully complementary with the parallel, but separate, plans for the development of mental handicap and mental illness services. This is of particular importance in relation to those who have a mental handicap or a mental illness who become old. The aim should be to ensure that there are no gaps between services nor unnecessary duplication, and that services are available to meet people's individual needs."</p></blockquote>
The problem is that parallel does not mean integrated, parallel lines never meet. The Bill is supposed to create a situation where people do not fall through the gap. The whole process needs to be brought together in an integrated approach to ensure that there are no gaps.<br><br>
The Government rely heavily on the voluntary sector, as has been demonstrated both by our discussions here and in many debates in the House in recent months. The voluntary sector is the key to the implementation of care policies. It involves people who have devoted years of their lives to caring for people, often initially for a problem within the family. The carers acquire a depth of knowledge about care needs which do not, and cannot, exist in professional bodies. Co-ordination is also important. A lack of coordination and integration will spell disaster, with the spread of the types of provision and choice heralded by the Bill.<br><br>
Many good developments have taken place in Wales, some in all-Wales strategies and others in local authorities. The South Glamorgan care-for-the-elderly hospital discharge scheme is a good example of providing for those who were falling through the gaps. That scheme is under-funded and viewed by professionals, as well as by the Minister and myself, as a vital, effective and cost-effective service. It requires resources to match its needs.<br><br>
The scheme illustrates the worry about the philosophy behind the White Paper and the Bill. The amendment ensures that planning is integrated and involves the voluntary sector. The amendment also ensures that public debate take place over a period of time. Such matters cannot be dealt with overnight. All the organisations and people involved must be consulted, to create a workable system. The Welsh Office, national bodies, local authorities in Wales and voluntary sector
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0869">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 957</span>
organisations have shown goodwill and commitment to the consultation process. The positive pattern of experience to date commends the pattern suggested in the amendment, which everyone could support.<br><br>
Earlier, reference was made to an elderly person with mobility problems following a stroke who was receiving the services of some 12 different agencies, but still felt that his voice was not being heard in all the professional assessments. Without wishing to curtail the power and responsibility of the local authority or the Welsh Office, the amendment seeks to create a pattern within which his voice and that of those committed to forms of need or disability can be heard, and to create a workable system, responsive to the needs of people locally and strategically throughout Wales. I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman said some nice things about the various strategies in Wales. Of course, we want proper consultation to take place between local authorities when they prepare community care plans. Hon. Members have heard several times about the Welsh Office draft planning guidance booklet. It says how plans should be drawn up and who should be involved and consulted. The draft guidance makes proposals for joint work and consultation with a range of statutory and voluntary bodies and users' interest groups.<br><br>
In the second paragraph, we say that when preparing plans the views of users of services must be taken into account. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) overlooked that. That is much wider than the requirement in the amendment. Where there are cross-boundary issues, we expect local authorities to consult each other and other agencies. Currently, as the hon. Gentleman said, we have the experience of the mental handicap and illness strategies, with residents who come from a wide area having to be taken into account. This could be an unwelcome statutory straitjacket.<br><br>
I was pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman say that everything could not be achieved overnight, because that is the point of continuing with the present mental handicap and illness strategies—although we envisage them being eventually integrated into the totality of our proposals. Nor can I see the point of statutorily requiring authorities jointly to submit their assessments to the Secretary of State. County plans, taken together, could do that in any event. If authorities wanted to make joint representations, well and good.<br><br>
Our guidance on social plans has been issued for consultation, as Welsh Members will know, and we shall issue the final version this spring. As part of that consultation, senior Welsh Office officials will be holding meetings in each county involving a full range of interests. Also, senior officials will be meeting representatives of the key all-Wales voluntary agencies with an interest in community care. The Welsh Office now has regular meetings with directors of social services, and I meet the chairmen and directors on a regular basis too. We also hold regular meetings with the Wales Council for Voluntary Action and with key voluntary organisations. In short, there is already a plenitude of consultation and discussion.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 958</span>
To establish a formal standing conference of statutory and voluntary agencies to vet plans, as the amendment requires, would simply exemplify the well-known Welsh tradition of forming committees. I sit on a number of committees and chair a number myself. When I look around a committee room, I reckon that 50 per cent of the people I see are chairmen of other committees—half of which I also sit on. That is a habit in Wales.<br><br>
Effective joint working at county and local levels is important; the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth stressed that himself. The social service inspectorate will monitor plans and the strategic planning of services. That, together with the arrangements that I have already outlined and the success that we have already had with our Wales strategies, shows that the amendments are unnecessary and top heavy. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I assure the Minister that I have given a more careful reading to his document than he supposes. Paragraph 2, to which he referred, states that in preparing plans, the views of users of services must be taken into account. However, on my first reading I wrote in the margin the word "how" with a question mark after it. It is that question that I have sought to answer in my amendments.<br><br>
Also, as I drew to the attention of the Committee, in paragraph 8 the Minister's advice seeks parallel development rather than integration. The very ethos of that paragraph illustrates the need for a system to ensure that there is integration, overlap and proper consultation.<br><br>
The Minister suggested that local authorities could somehow get over the problem by talking to each other. If we are not careful, one authority will simply talk to the authority next door. The point of our amendment is to suggest that the voluntary sector should be involved in areas of overlap—in strategic decision-making as well as local decision-making. The users and the voluntary organisations should be used in an open process of discussion at an all-Wales level.<br><br>
If the Minister looks again at the amendment he will see that it does not propose a committee. We did not propose a formal body that would be in place for ever and a day. We proposed the type of standing conference arrangement that would bring together a body for a purpose—to consider the plans on an integrated basis when they were ready to be considered. When the local plans had been produced and the Welsh Office had considered them, it would be time to discuss them on an integrated, all-Wales basis.<br><br>
In some of his remarks, the Minister expressed sympathy with the aspirations behind the amendments, so I hope that he will agree to consider them, together with existing practices, to see whether our proposals could be incorporated into a system of dealing with the latter stages of planning and consultation in a way that will satisfy us. In that hope and with the intention of returning to the amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p>11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 745, in page 41, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) shall, in consultation with relevant health authorities, identify staff currently in the employment of any such health authority whose duties and responsibilities may be significantly affected by the local authority's proposed plan, and shall incorporate in the plan measures to secure the continued employment of such staff.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to gain assurances on behalf of nursing staff who will be affected by the transfer of responsibilities from the health authority to the local authority, for care in the community of the elderly and the mentally handicapped. In "Community Care: An Agenda for Action", Sir Roy Griffiths states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is important that the skills of staff formerly employed in long stay hospitals are not lost, as patients are discharged and responsibility for their care passes to another authority. Such staff are likely to have direct personal knowledge of individual former patients and their needs, as well as a wide range of skills which are equally valuable in a community care setting. There are legislative and other problems which inhibit the smooth transfer of staff between agencies at present, which can delay desirable changes."</p></blockquote>
Sir Roy Griffiths clearly wants something to be done. He continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are a number of options for local action in regard to staff. They may be seconded to the local authority which has the advantage of being a flexible approach. There can be locally arranged transfers to local authority employment with no redundancy compensation and with the retention of NHS superannuation scheme membership, which can be an important consideration for the staff concerned. Finally, the health authority can make the staff redundant followed by engagement of the same staff by the local authority. Each of these options has its own advantages and disadvantages."</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt that the Government and previous Administrations have spent large amounts of money on training nurses in the skills of caring for people, which were recognised by Sir Roy Griffiths. He urged that Government should take action as local management should have clear and detailed guidance. The unions involved, such as the National Union of Public Employees, the Confederation of Health Service Employees and the Royal College of Nursing, are all worried that the Government have not been more specific in how they envisage the transfer of nursing staff into the community.<br><br>
The local authority may wish to take over the employment of nursing staff. If so, the unions wish to see acceptable terms of transfer and conditions. We believe that nurses should not be denied any of the benefits that will accrue to those who remain employed by the DHA. For example, nurses who look after people with mental handicaps have long valued their entitlement to retire at 55. It can be hard both physically and mentally to care for such clients, and I doubt whether hon. Members—certainly not Opposition Members—would want them to lose that round.<br><br>
We are anxious to ensure that the statutory accountability of nurses to the United Kingdom central council is protected if they are transferred to local authority employment. Respect for that accountability would be a vital safeguard in ensuring high standards of nursing care in future. Moreover, it is important that nurses working in local authority environments have access to peer review. They must have a professional chain of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 960</span>
management to ensure that, in professional matters, they have access to managers with nursing experience.<br><br>
It is important that nurses employed by local authorities are given time off to attend the mandatory refresher courses that will soon be required by the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting. We, the Royal College of Nursing and other nursing unions believe that nursing staff will be fundamentally important if community care is to become a reality. The Government must clarify how such staff will be affected by the transfer to local authority employment. Will the Minister, even at this late stage, assure us about that? We are discussing many dedicated people who deserve the best treatment that we can provide. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) is most worried about the future of nursing staff. However, the amendment covers more than nursing staff. It refers to collaboration between health authorities and social services authorities. Our worry is not confined to health authority staff who are employed in long-stay care. A raft of disciplines such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy fall within community care. New exciting therapies involving music and art are being developed to treat people who are recovering from strokes and so on. If there is not adequate interworking between health authorities and social services authorities, the future of employees in that sector could be at risk.<br><br>
I am indebted to a private sector initiative in Newcastle, which has sought to identify the patterns of provision of the local authority and the health authority, and bring them together. As for speech therapy provision, the city is one of the national centres of excellence. One speech therapist deals with adults and the elderly in the community, with about 100 clients aged 65 years or more during the year out of a total of 240 clients. That is a substantial case load to be borne by one health authority member of staff.<br><br>
Another therapist manages the communications aid centre, where an estimated 100 young physically handicapped clients receive advice and assistance throughout the year. That service extends to clients beyond the city boundary and the district speech therapist estimates that only 20 per cent of the clients live in Newcastle. This causes much anxiety: how is this service, which will be one of the growth areas of provision if community care takes off in the way that we seek, to be provided? Not only are these members of staff employed by the health authority now, but most of their clients do not even come from Newcastle. How are we to stitch together the community care plans of all the neighbouring authorities to ensure that the provision continues and is the basis for further development?<br><br>
One of the great weaknesses of the network of services provided for in clause 41 is the point of collaboration between social services authorities and health
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0871">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 961</span>
authorities. Inevitably, and inescapably, given the system of contract that we have examined in the NHS part of the Bill, we know of the squeeze that there will be on health authority budgets. There is a danger that services will be passed from health authorities to the commuity care sector, and that the local authorities, possibly because the networks of staff serve more than their own local authority areas, will attempt to force the provision of services out of the area for which they are financially responsible, and back into the NHS sector.<br><br>
The White Paper acknowledges the problem: The necessary machinery must be laid in place to ensure that a raft of provisions does not disappear because neither the machinery of collaboration nor the will, nor, much more likely, the resources to stitch the network of provision together, have been provided.<br><br>
We do not wish to use the amendment only to debate the narrow point that it raises. We wish also to press the Minister on what machinery she visualises will engineer the necessary collaboration between health authorities and social services authorities? What safety nets does the hon. Lady intend to provide in the form of regulations if the collaboration, for whatever reason, does not ensure the continuity and development of these specialisms?<br><br>
In Newcastle, nursing care, speech therapy, occupational therapy and all the other community care services are provided by health authorities. It is a centre of excellence. These matters have already been explored there to some degree. We have a network of community homes for the mentally handicapped that have arisen out of the health sector. This provision replaces much of the long-stay care provided in large institutions.<br><br>
The NHS part of the Bill will lead to the enforced disposal of these community homes for the mentally handicapped by the Health service sector. They will have to be provided by voluntary housing associations or other bodies. There is much anxiety about how the network of joint health and social services provisions will be maintained and developed. If the staff cease to exist, or finance cannot be found for them, the provision will collapse. There must also be machinery behind the employment of the staff. What mechanism does the Minister envisage being created to ensure that collaboration between health authorities and social services authorities will continue on the proper basis between health authorities and social services authorities? How will the Minister engineer the finance into the hands of one or other authority to ensure that that provision continues on a co-ordinated basis?</span></p>
<p>11.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The amendment is important. I want to draw attention to a dispute that took place in Brighton, not Kent, in conditions where such arrangements were not clearly set down.<br><br>
The amendment relates to incorporating in the plan
<br><blockquote><p>"measures to secure the continued employment of such staff."</p></blockquote>
The Bill does not refer to paragraph 7.13, 7.14 or 7.15 of the Griffiths report, to which my hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 962</span>
Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) referred. Paragraph 7.14 provides three ways to resolve the problem. First is the secondment of staff to the local authority from the district health authority. A second option is
<br><blockquote><p>"locally arranged transfers to local authority employment with no redundancy compensation and with the retention of NHS superannuation scheme membership."</p></blockquote>
the third is to make staff redundant
<br><blockquote><p>"followed by engagement of the same staff by the local authority."</p></blockquote>
Sir Roy Griffiths thought that that was most important. His words are clear. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is inexcusable for general progress to be halted because of this issue. I therefore recommend that central government make a clear decision on the action to be taken."</p></blockquote>
The Griffths recommendation was that there should be action, and we assume that he thought that action would be included in the Bill. Yet the Bill makes no reference to it.<br><br>
That will inevitably lead to trouble. I have talked to Health Service workers in the union that sponsors me—the Confederation of Health Service Employees. We are now getting the early sounds of inevitable industrial action and conflict as the changeover takes place. I warn the Government not to go down that route. We need a provision in the Bill to clarify people's rights.<br><br>
I want to trace the developments in a specific case so that Ministers can see what happens when there is no relationship and no proper consultation. The case involves the Brighton and Hove area group housing association. To trace the history of the case it is necessary to go back to the birth of what was labelled the Foremost Project, launched in 1983 by Brighton health authority, which aimed to move people with learning difficulties—mental handicap—out of large institutions into small, well-staffed group homes in the community where they could develop their individual lives and a greater degree of independent choice. The health authority worked with the social services department of East Sussex county council in establishing the scheme. The idea was to put the houses eventually under social services management. Phase I of Foremost was for younger clients—now young adults—with Phase II from 1985 catering for older adults. Besides being warmly endorsed by people throughout the Brighton area, the Foremost concept and the way that it was carried through won national recognition and a RIPA award for mangerial innovation. So it worked.<br><br>
During 1987/88 Brighton health authority officers began to refer to the possibility of transferring Foremost I to a housing association rather than social services. Two factors combined to push Foremost in that direction. First, cuts in BHA funding left it with a large shortfall on the Foremost programme. Staff were told that one of five houses would have to close—the usual sort of thing when cuts are in prospect. Secondly, impending changes in Government rules would cut benefits available to long-stay patients in accommodation owned by health authorities, but allow much higher DHSS board-and-lodging allowances if it were owned by a housing association.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0872">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 963</span>
In December 1987, the county council's social services committee agreed to develop links with the Brighton, Hove and Area Group Housing Association—BHAGHA—with a view to being able to "maximise DHSS benefits". The partner which the county council chose for that important role was modest indeed. BHAGHA has been a registered housing association since 1976. By 31 March 1988, according to official returns to the Housing Corporation, it had built up its stock to a grand total of three properties, comprising 18 bed spaces. Its one house in Brighton and two in Hove had a combined value of £163,000. A few years earlier there had been a scheme to add eight more properties, but it came to nothing. Apparently, residents in the three houses included people with psychiatric problems, but support for them consisted only of volunteers paying visits. BHAGHA, in effect, employed no one.<br><br>
By 11 February 1989—the deadline by which Foremost workers had to sign BHAGHA contraccts—51 out of 55 then in post had refused to do so. The Foremost staff were under intense pressure from their employer. One activist commented, "We were all scared". However, they decided to make a stand on one basic demand: a guarantee of full collective bargaining rights, with recognition of their trade unions. The purpose was simply, as one shop steward said, to have an avenue if things went wrong in the future.<br><br>
Foremost's underlying concern throughout had been for the standard of service to its clients. But with the Brighton health authority and BHAGHA making no response to the many concerns about Foremost's possible direction, trade union representation was the one means staff had left to defend the service and the vulnerable people whose future depended on it.<br><br>
This problem was drawn to my attention in the middle of last year when I received a telephone call from a COHSE official in the Brighton area. Anyone who had the pleasure of attending last year's Labour party conference in Brighton would have noticed a line of placards along the front of the conference building. Those placards belonged to workers who were being forced to transfer under the conditions laid down, and were angry about it. They have had a great deal of publicity in the Brighton area. They have been on television, radio and in the newspapers. There have been arugments in the local authority and district health authority. Early-day motions have been tabled in Parliament, and the Secretary of State has been asked about it on the Floor of the House. All that arises from the fact that unless the system is defined in a form acceptable to both sides, it will not work. Without any clear guidance about how the transfer is to take place, there will invevitably be conflict.<br><br>
I should like to quote from a letter from the Foremost Staff Co-ordinating Group which was sent to right hon. and hon. Members to solicit their support and 10 minutes of their time. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Although Foremost is a relatively small service, in the light of the Griffiths report and the white paper 'Working for Patients', this dispute is not only of national significance, as Health Authorities and Social Service Departments throughout the country establish a variety of contractual arrangements with the voluntary and private sectors, where there are few guidelines and no overall national precedents"—</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 964</span>
this is a comment on the absence of definable way of avoiding conflict—
<br><blockquote><p>"but also, as an unreasoned attack on the basic priciples of trade unionism, it is a dispute of general and urgent significance to the whole of the labour movement."</p></blockquote>
The letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite worries about the ability of BHAGHA to maintain the quality of the service, in April all the staff accepted posts within BHAGHA, conditionally only upon the continuance of trade union rights. With BHAGHA so far refusing this guarantee only one house has transfered to date, but recently"—</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister notes what happened—
<br><blockquote><p>"one house has been closed, the people living there moved back to hospital".</p></blockquote>
Matters degenerated so much in the conflict that people had to be moved back to hospital because of the absence of proper guidelines laid down nationally or of legislative requirement.<br><br>
The letter goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"the staff temporarily redeployed into the remaining three houses whose transfer date is the 30 November 1989 …Our offer to transfer with full trade union recognition is still open, but neither Brighton Health Authority, East Sussex County Council or BHAGHA are approaching it.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In community homes such as these, the staff, the human involvement and interaction they create, represent 99 per cent of the service. Staff work long and unsocial hours, nights, weekends and bank holidays. We are not well paid and there is a high incidence of back injury—a familiar story in the caring professions.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We enjoy the work and are committed to the service, but these conditions are both a measure and the full extent of our flexibility. We are not prepared to see our conditions worsened (BHAGHA have already proposed to lengthen our working week) and we are not prepared to lose our only united voice, our only avenue when things go wrong.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>For the last year we have been negotiating positively for a solution. We have approached ACAS, we have suggested secondment,"—</p></blockquote>
as embodied in the Griffiths recommendations not included in the legislation—
<br><blockquote><p>"we have explored every possibility, and we will continue to press for the best possible solution for the service."</p></blockquote>
The letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has been a long dispute and has achieved a small degree of publicity in professional journals, but this may be the first of many disputes throughout the country in similar services over similar issues."</p></blockquote>
If ever there were a sign to the Government of impending conflict over the issue of a clearly-defined policy on these matters, or provisions in legislation, it exists in this dispute. Ministers must deal with that.<br><br>
Mr. Whitehouse, who ran the operation in the Brighton area, and I crossed swords on the matter. He tried to reassure me, but could not assure me that there would be immediate acceptance of the trade union representational requirements of the people wanting to transfer. He talked about decisions being taken later. He did not rule out recognition, but failed to understand the anxieties of people who were moving from one service and from being under one type of managerial control to another. He failed to understand that that creates conflict and worry for the people involved in those transfers.<br><br>
The Government must intervene. If in two or three years' time hon. Members have to ask questions on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0873">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 965</span>
Floor of the House about the dispute that arose over the transfer from one organisation to another, the Bill's objectives to secure a peaceful changeover will have been negated. I ask Ministers to consider this case. It is an example of what can happen when things go wrong. No member of the Committee would wish matters to turn out like that. Ministers should be positive in responding to the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The amendment would write into the arrangements for community care plans considerations of the staff involved. This is not an appropriate place to include provisions for staff. We have in mind the users of the services and their carers, as opposed to the staff. I think that all Committee members agree that the provision of high-quality services and the commitment of staff are inter-related, but the amendment is not appropriate in the context of this clause. Opposition Members have spoken with feeling about the issues involved for those whose employers or work will change. I do not think that any hon. Member would seek to set in aspic the working conditions of any group. Patterns of care change, and people hold different views about appropriate forms of care. I hope that, under the provisions of the Bill, home care will increase. That will involve redeployment, retraining and changes in working practices.<br><br>
The cases mentioned by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) are a matter for the employing authorities. Good managers will ensure that their staff are properly briefed and that communications are good, not only for the sake of altruism but so that they can provide the best contribution. The cases are complicated, so I shall study the record to see whether I can make any further points to the hon. Gentleman. In some areas local health authorities or social services departments have made excellent progress. I understand that in Exeter, Denbigh and Clwyd, for example, alterations in people's employment have proceeded without difficulty. However, I shall look at the cases again to see whether there is room for further guidance or advice.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) will withdraw the amendment. It would not be appropriate to include staff matters in the important community care plan provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I do not understand why provisions relating to staff cannot be included in the Bill. It is not written on tablets of stone that staff should not be considered. It seems commonsensical to look after staff, and if the Government were serious about good quality care they would do so.<br><br>
I was especially interested in the case outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). I remember speaking to the people involved when I was at the Labour party conference. I believe that staff transfer will become a major issue over the next few years.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

In clause 41, community care services are narrowly defined. Unless the definition is broadened, services that several hon. Members regard as community care services will be excluded from the Bill. The amendments would include in the Bill community care services that are defined in other Acts.<br><br>
I shall speak first to amendment No. 600. The White Paper makes it clear that people who are old or who suffer from mental illness, mental handicap or physical disability may need long-term care. It also states that people with drug or alchohol-related disorders, multiple handicaps or progressive illnesses such as AIDS or multiple sclerosis, may also need community care at times. Unless services for those groups are defined in the Bill, community care plans will be drafted without taking their needs into account. The services that they need will not be developed. The definition of community care services should be widened to ensure that all vulnerable groups and community care needs are considered. Amendment No.600 deals with some of the groups that I just mentioned.<br><br>
Amendment No.601 broadens the definition of community care by including part of the Local Govenment and Housing Act 1989. The Committee has dicussed housing. The White Paper makes it clear that people with increasing disabilities can stay in their homes only if their homes are adapted. Some of the adaptations come under section 101 of the 1989 Act. The amendment would ensure that the broad provision of adaptations for people with disabilities—a key feature of community care provision—is covered by the Bill. Therefore, they would be considered in the development of community care plans, service provision and assessment procedures.<br><br>

Amendment No. 602 deals with the provision of agency services for the elderly and the disabled who want to repair, improve or adapt their homes. Those services are provided under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. I think that we are agreed that we want to encourage elderly people to stay at their homes for as long as they can. The amendment would enable them to do so. If we want to include agency services in the Bill, the definition of community care services has to be broadened—again.<br><br>
Amendment No. 499 clarifies the relationship between the Bill and the Children Act 1989. The White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The two programmes are consistent and complementary … There is no intention of creating a division between child care and community care services; the full range of social services authority functions should continue to form a coherent whole."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is inconsistent to exclude from the Bill the childrens' services covered by the Children Act 1989.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have caused offence, by omission, to my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). Rwy'n falch i glywed bod fy ffrind anrhydeddus hefyd wedi ymweld â Bae Colwyn, ond yn siomedig iawn iddeallt bod neb wedi galw i weld fy Mam. I am rather disappointed that neither you, Dame Janet, nor my hon. Friend found the time to visit my mother while you were there.<br><br>
The Opposition's amendment would ensure that care in the community also means care for the community. It aims to ensure that community care plans include services for people who are vulnerable due to their social conditions, rather than to any specific disability or chronic illness which are dealt with in the amendment of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). Our amendment refers to people
<br><blockquote><p>"who are vulnerable as a result of violence or physical or sexual abuse, or who have an unsettled way of life."</p></blockquote>
Those problems can give rise to a need for support and practical help from local authorities or from voluntary organisations. People suffering such problems require community care in spite of the fact that their need is social, rather than mental or physical.<br><br>
The Committee should consider both sides of the problem. The experiences of people with mental illness living in the community show that if they are not given the support that they require to live an independent life, and are not helped to integrate into society, many problems can be created. One individual was teased beyond endurance. It is not unusual to read in the press the consequences of such cases.<br><br>
I recall talking to a hospital superintendent at a mental hospital in south Wales. After one of the first waves of movement to care in the community, he said that when he came into the centre of Cardiff it always worried him to see some of his ex-patients among the down-and-outs there. Clearly, they had not moved from an institution to care in the community, but to being uncared for.<br><br>
Problems can arise when someone with the social problems that I mentioned ends up, rightly and prop-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 968</span>
erly, being rehoused. If that person is rehoused without the support services, disaster can result.<br><br>
In recent years as a local councillor and since becoming a Member, I have dealt with several cases of a person who was in care being rehoused in a flat alongside elderly people. The result has been a disaster on both sides of the equation. Such people need to be rehoused, but with the care and support to enable them to live independent lives—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I ask the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) to take the matter seriously. If he had seen the misery that has resulted for elderly people in such circumstances, he would be willing to be patient for a couple of minutes to consider the problem and the need to cater for it in the Bill. Such people need support in the community, but in reality not just in theory.<br><br>
The result of such cases has sometimes been misery for old people, who have had to be involved in court cases and in giving evidence to remove a problem from their community. But for the person who has been rehoused alongside them, it means the fresh experience of failure and rejection and the collapse of a situation which, with appropriate care and support, could have been turned into success. In other words, it is a failure for the individual, disaster and misery for his neighbours and failure for care in the community. The vulnerable individual needs proper support services if care in the community is to work and the community at large should provide such support to meet the needs of the individual and those of the wider community.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will recognise the problem and widen the scope of the Bill for a small but significant element which is important if community care is to work properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims<span class='memberconstituency'> (Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:I apologise for detaining the Committee, but these are important matters which we may not have another opportunity to discuss. I wish to supplement the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Action (Sir G. Young) by inviting the Minister to tell us the Government's intentions for low-incidence disability. That is the expression used in the "trade" for those who need special care, but whose numbers in any one area are such that it is unlikely that one authority could provide such care. I have in mind especially the deaf-blind, of whom it is estimated there are 3,000 between the ages of 16 and 49, although there may well be more. In national terms, that is a relatively low figure. It is estimated, however, that there could be 30,000 or more people with multiple disabilities, including sight and hearing impairment and learning difficulties.<br><br>
The problem is that someone with a low-incidence disability such as deaf—blindness cannot fit into a service designed for other needs. A service for the mentally handicapped will not be any good for someone who is not intellectually imparied but has communication and mobility problems. A service designed for hearing impaired people is probably of no use to someone who also has limited vision. Similarly, a service designed for a visually impaired person will probably depend upon hearing. There is a danger that deaf-blind people, who are especially isolated, may be placed in the wrong service.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0875">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 969</span>
There are several such cases, which I shall not describe to the Committee, but the name of Beverley Lewis will be fresh in people's minds. The problem is that for such cases the service may need to be provided from more than one local authority area, either by a voluntary organisation or by a consortium of authorities. For example, local authorities have no experience of designing care arrangements for the deaf-blind. Thre are five further education centres for them, which are all run by voluntary organisations. So far as I know, no local authority has established a group home that is designed for deaf-blind people. Who will deal with them and how will them be cared for?</span></p>
<p>11.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell<span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:Is it not also a question of who will pay for them? It may be appropriate to consider the sort of central funding that is offered for cases of mental handicap.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Whether such people have to be funded centrally or by their local authority is another problem.<br><br>
Care for the deaf-blind may require co-operation between local authorities, and between those authorities and voluntary organisations. I do not suggest a large bureaucracy, such as the children regional planning committees, which were generally considered to be not the greatest success. It is important that there be some mechanism. There should at least be guidance from the Department to local authorities about coordinating their efforts, especially with voluntary organisations. Perhaps within a consortium of local authorities, there are enough people with those disabilities to go to a home that a voluntary organisation would be willing to run, but somebody has to get the parties together. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell us the Govenment's thinking on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:As hon. Members will be aware, the policy objectives of the White Paper are to help to improve services to all vulnerable people, which includes the groups mentioned in the amendment. We should be loath to write in the specific groups for which services should be provided, because we are considering the overall, comprehensive range of services for those who need community care. Local authorities are responsible for planning, assessing and seeking to meet those needs.<br><br>
In the clause we seek to define community care services. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) mentioned the services provided under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. They are the responsibility of local housing authorities, and it would be inappropriate to ask social service authorities to plan for them. The last Act mentioned in the amendment is the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, which relates to local authority functions under section 29 of the National Assistance Act 1948, and it is therefore already covered by the definition of community care services in the Bill.<br><br>
Several hon. Members have suggested that the provision of suitable accommodation might have to be an intergral part of the package of services that disabled people need for successful community care. Social ser-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 970</span>
vices authorities will need to consult housing authorities, both statutory and independent, when drawing up their plans. I assure Opposition Members that we shall cover that aspect in our guidance. That goes back to what we said earlier about the importance of working closely with housing authorities.<br><br>
The amendments that would bring the planning for children services into the clause would blur the distinction that many hon. Members spent most of last year seeking to establish, which was to bring together all the local authority responsibilities for children under the Children Act 1989. The local authorities, functions under the Act include planning, indentifying children in need, providing information and meeting their needs. We shall issue further guidance on children but it would be wrong to confuse that issue by bringing them into this category.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) spoke about low-incidence disability. The outcome of the community care proposals and the DHAs' new role in planning for the health needs of the resident populations will provide a more effective mechanism for ensuring that people with low-incidence disabilities are given the recognition that they need. With the contracting system it will be possible to place them in voluntary institutions of the sort that my hon. Friend mentioned. As he will agree, many of them have done excellent work, especially in providing services for groups that are easily overlooked by the general range of services.<br><br>
In the White Paper we make it clear that many volutary organisations will benefit from the clearer contractural arrangements that local authorities will make with them. We envisage their continuing to prosper. When bringing forward our guidance on plans, and on assessment, we shall make sure that all the groups that hon. Members have mentioned are given the recognition that they need. That will be the most appropriate time to draw it to local authorities' attention and to ensure that the boundaries between the different service providers are properly recognised and understood, so that the best quality care can be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That was a helpful response. There is no disagreement about the objective. If my hon. Friend the Minister can give me one assurance, I shall be happy to withdraw my amendment. An agency that provides advice on care and repair for the elderly may be funded under legislation that is not mentioned in the Bill but which is included in my amendment. Will the Minister assure me that the social services department will not tell that organisation that it will not consult or include the organisation in its plans for community care because the community care services that it provides do not fall within the Bill? Will my hon. Friend assure me that that will also not happen in the cases that I referred to in my opening remarks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Will the Minister also respond to the points that I made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Community care plans are developed to arrange the provision of community care

services. If the services to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Actor (Sir G. Young) refers are provided under housing legislation, it is for housing authorities to plan for that provision. The crucial point is that there should be collaboration and discussion in bringing forward the plans. Joint agreements or plans will be necessary in many areas, not only on the housing side but on the health authority side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That was not an answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). The hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Will my hon. Friend give an example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman gave two examples. Perhaps they could be dealt with in the Minister's reply. Could such organisations be excluded on the grounds that the legislation does not define them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry to press the point, but the hon. Lady clearly did not listen to a word that I said in speaking to our amendment. I do not see why Committee members should be kept in detention, as it were, in order for her to give an answer. I was going to seek an assurance that the Minister would read the record, consider the points and then reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I have much sympathy for my hon. Friend's view that the Minister of State, and occasionally other Ministers, do not reply to our points. Sometimes I have thought that it was because they had no answer, but I strongly suspect now that it is because they simply do not want to give an answer. For example, every single time—I think that <i>Hansard</i> will bear this out—that the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 has been mentioned, there has been absolutely no comment from the Minister replying to the debate.<br><br>
A statement issued yesterday by the Department of Health said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 originated as a Private Members Bill,"—</p></blockquote>
it did not mention the hon. Member responsible—
<br><blockquote><p>"supported by the Government".—</p></blockquote>
which is another way of saying that the Minister at the time said that the Government's position was one of sceptical neutrality. However, it has not led to a single reply on the Act from any Minister so far. Has my hon. Friend noticed that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:It becomes glaringly obvious when my hon. Friend points it out, and I hope that in the time that remains to the Committee we shall have some answers to questions. I was obviously speaking to an amendment which has a general purpose, but I gave three examples from direct experience of people in the community and of individuals who need help if they are

to live independently in the community. If the Minister requires time, I am happy to give it, and I ask her to let us have her considered response to my points. I certainly endorse the request, made in my hon. Friend's intervention, that she should consider all the times when the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act has been mentioned and respond to each of them as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I think that I have had the answer which I sought from the intervention by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I want to be given some idea of where the form of the collaboration on community care plans between health authorities and social services authorities will be provided for.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, made a reply on 9 January, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We expect local authorities to prepare their community social care plans on the basis of planning agreements which involve health authorities."—<i>[Offical Report, Standing Committee E, 9 January 1990; c. 102.]</i></p></blockquote>
That is perfectly reasonable. We have all been waiting for clause 41, which is the community care social plan clause, to see how those planning agreements are to be provided. The term "planning agreement" is used in the community care White Paper; and specific requirements are mentioned, such as "common goals" between health authorities and social services authorities,
<br><blockquote><p>"funding agreements, setting out the basis on which health and social care will be funded;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"agreed policies on key operational areas, such as quality standards, assessment policies and procedures and discharge policies;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>agreed contract specifications for securing joint working between service providers."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the planning agreement between health and social services authorities will be a major tool in implementing the community care plan. It is not just a question of guidance requiring that those bodies consult each other. Agreement will be a major, functional, operational part of the delivery of the community care plan. It is clearly referred to: a planning agreement between health authorities and social services authorities.<br><br>
12 midnight<br><br>
But where in the Bill is this planning agreement? How is it to be generated? Are we to rely on it being produced as a result of subsequent guidance to social services authorities and health authorities? Will there be subsequent regulations? Where does the Bill refer to what will clearly be a significant piece of machinery for the delivery of community care services—that is, the planning agreement between social services authorities and health authorities? It is not mentioned in the Bill at all.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0877">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 973</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The key misunderstanding is that the hon. Gentleman seeks a cumbersome, methanistic device to secure joint planning agreements between health and local authorities. What is clear in the provision of community care and in drawing up a plan—we have frequently said this—is the need to ensure that such plans synchronise with the provision of services by health and, indeed, housing authorities, a matter that has been mentioned several times. A number of the devices that we suggest to carry forward the arrangements of mutual convenience to ensure the proper provision of services work through precisely the mechanisms described by the hon. Gentleman. The guidance will contain more advice on the various aspects of working with health authorities.<br><br>
However, we do not intend to enshrine the precise mechanisms in legislation. We wish to achieve effective working on the ground. For those who provide community care services the provision of district nurses may be enormously important and so a planning agreement on the provision of district nurses may be a component. But local authorities and health authorities must work together to ensure that their plans are effective in providing services. It is not a matter of enshrining in legislation a formal, mechanistic arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry to return to the matter. Nothing that I said suggested that I want something cumbersome or mechanistic. I simply referred back to the ministerial team its own terminology: planning agreement. I agree that, given the history of that term, it has some slightly odd resonances. But presumably the ministerial team bore that in mind when it used the term.<br><br>
Paragraph 6.10 of the White Paper, "Caring for People" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government proposes to base future national policy on planning agreements".</p></blockquote>
Yet nowhere does the Bill refer to planning agreements or any provision or status for them, even though they will clearly be important.<br><br>
There is no disagreement between us. I quite like the idea of planning agreements between health and social services authorities. I quite like the term planning agreement. Such agreements need not be cumbersome. But if the Minister will tell us that it is not an optional extra, something that may or may not be produced out of consultation between health and social services authorities, then it will be a key part of the delivery of the community care system. We are entitled to ask how the planning agreements on the ground will be provided for. Or, are we to rely simply on their being produced by voluntary effort alone, if there is no provision to ensure that such agreements exist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend has hit on a substantial issue but the Minister failed to reply to him. The White Paper entitled "Caring for People" clearly lays out the Government's intent and Conservative Members should listen to the words that it uses. They can then ask why there is no reference to planning agreements in the Bill.<br><br>
Paragraph 6.10 of the White Paper states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 974</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government proposes to base future national policy on planning agreements rather than joint plans".</p></blockquote>
When the Labour Government produced the Industry Act 1974, their White Paper referred to the need for planning agreements in relation to Government and industry, and they were at the heart of that Act.<br><br>
The White Paper continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"although if full joint plans are agreed"—</p></blockquote>
<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker wish to intervene? He seems to have a lot to say for himself although we have not seen much of him today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Get on with it!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Order. I think that, at this hour, seated interventions are probably unwise—more so than at other times of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I need your protection, Dame Janet. It is clear that, at this early hour in our proceedings, Conservative Members want to clear off and avoid facing their responsibilities.<br><br>
Paragraph 6.10 of the White Paper continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"although if full joint plans are agreed as the best way forward in particular circumstances there would be no impediment to authorities producing them. These planning agreements would encompass a realistic range of key requirements to be reflected in both health and local authority plans. The key requirements of planning agreements will be … common goals derived at least partly from national policy aims for particular client groups; funding agreements, setting out the basis on which health and social care will be funded; agreed policies on key operational areas, such as quality standards, assessment policies and procedures and discharge policies; agreed contract specifications for securing joint working between service providers."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 6.11 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Such an approach will bring about a shift in focus from means to ends while leaving ample scope for innovation. The Government likewise intends to concentrate on outcomes rather than machinery."</p></blockquote>
The White paper seems to commit the Government to a principle of establishing planning agreements, but, for reasons that we do not understand, they have not embodied that principle in the legislation. I and my hon. friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) want to know why they have not done so.<br><br>
If there is an explanation of why planning agreements should not be embodied in the Bill, we should be told it. Perhaps the Government have changed their mind and no longer believe that they are necessary, but let them give the Committee their explanation. People outside the House who are not involved in our proceedings and have no time to read the accounts in the <i>Official Report</i> of our debates here and in the House want to know why the planning agreements so carefully proposed in the White Paper are not to be proceeded with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Both hon. Gentlemen have referred, only too clearly, to what we seek to achieve. When the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said that the Government intend to concentrate on outcomes rather than machinery he

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 975</span>
described our position correctly. The guidance will recognise that intention.<br><br>
The same subject is mention in paragraph 2 of the guidance issued by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"social care plans should be prepared and published by social services authorities. They will be expected to produce the plans jointly with health authorities and family practitioner committees, and in consultation with representatives of voluntary and private sectors, housing authorities and housing associations."</p></blockquote>
That is how we intend the services to be developed. That is how outcomes can be achieved without an excessive concentration on machinery. If the need arises the Secretary of State will be able to direct district health authorities and social services departments to collaborate or make planning agreements if there is any failure to comply with guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:We are getting somewhere. It is a pity that we could not have been told that at the outset instead of having to keep nagging for the information.<br><br>
I do not have the honour of representing a Welsh constituency so I have not seen the document from which the Minister quoted. Will the hon. Lady assure us that the phraseology of the guidance issued to health authorities and social services departments in England will be couched in similar strong terms to those used in the guidance issued for Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The paragraph that the Minister read out is the one on which a question arose earlier.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I take to heart the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. Will the Minister assure us that at least before we complete the Committee stage we can see the draft guidance for England that will be written in similar terms to the Welsh document? We would then be able to study it and consider the implications of the phraseology. If we were sastisfied we would be able to drop the matter. If not, we would have the option of returning to the matter on Report. It would be helpful if that important matter could be dealt with before the Bill leaves the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is indeed correct. I apologise. Due to the lateness of the hour my tongue must have slipped. Planning agreements, as the White paper

The Welsh authorities have made excellent progress in preparing their guidance, which is hardly surprising. We have already published our draft guidance on inspection units. We shall produce guidance on several areas in the coming months. I cannot undertake that the guidance on social care plans will be available before we report because there is a heavy programme of consultative documents preparation. We must consider the views of local authorities, directors of social services, voluntary organisations, the independent sector, the carer's organisation—all the groups that we have described.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
We have discussed community care plans constructivley and at length. Many hon. Members have made excellent suggestions that I shall discuss further. We must ensure that the guidance considers all the options. We should fully and effectively conduct that process rather than make undue haste.<br><br>
The community care guidance will build on the lengthy description of plans in the White Paper. I could refer to all the advice and guidance that I have received about how the plans should be drawn up. I regret that the hon. Gentleman should have thought that there was some mystery about the way in which agreements with health authorities could be made. Most of my hon. Friends assumed that it had been spelled out clearly in the White Paper that there were no grounds for change and that it was a sensible and practical way forward. I hope that the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friends feel that the thought and care that has gone into drawing up community care plans will bear excellent fruit. When the guidance is brought forward all those hon. Members who have spoken so fully will be able to let us have their views. We want to get community care plans right because they are crucial and will be an important tool. There must be clarity. Special cases must be properly recognised and the different agencies must understand how they will make their contributions. Above all, the plans must be available to users and carers as a vehicle for improving services for them.</span></p>
