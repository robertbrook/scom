and learned Friend the Member for Burton (Mr. Lawrence), but I am not sure mat that would be for the convenience of the Committee. I should probably get glowering looks from the Whip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before lunch, I was saying that it is essential that those who are charged with the assessment of priority care groups, such as the elderly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the lengthy speech with which we have been threatened. I need to hear the hon. Gentleman and there seem to be various kinds of strange noises off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. It is essential that those who are charged with assessment of groups who are to be cared for in the community should be properly trained for their task. When we assess the needs of children who are at risk or abused, we take great care to set up multi-disciplinary case conferences and to assess the needs of those children as carefully and expertly as possible. We should assess no less carefully the needs of the mentally handicapped and mentally ill who are to be cared for in the community and the elderly who may be cared for in residential homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will tell the Committee about the progress of her discussions on training with organisations, such as the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work and the Association of Directors of Social Services. That is central to our discussions on assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of the Social Services Select Committee that investigated care in the community in 1984. That study revealed that the good schemes were those to which proper thought and assessment had been given and which were run by suitable people. We would do less than justice to the task of assessment if we were not so to train those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) in his desire—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I to take it that the hon. Gentleman is arguing for an additional year's professional training for social workers? That would increase the training period from two to three years and put British social workers on a par with those in other EEC countries. If that is the hon. Gentleman's argument, what is his view of the Government's position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former member of CCETSW, I understand the organisation's case for that and I have considered the matter. It is for my hon. Friend the Minister to state the Government's position. There is an argument for increasing the training of social workers. Many of them are inadequately trained, even when they have completed their professional qualification. Additional training would be relevant if they wanted to specialise in a particular branch of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that the people who make the assessments should be properly equipped for the task. Perhaps in future there will be better assessment of the needs of people in groups, such as the mentally ill, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1015</span>
mentally handicapped and the elderly, who are to be cared for in the community. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms Harman) must be bored with our proceedings already as she has just yawned widely. I shall therefore give the floor to other hon. Members who wish to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the most pleasurable aspects of being a Member of the Committee is listening to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe). I am genuine in paying him that tribute. He has experience that is unique among Committee Members, with the exceptions of my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs Mahon) and of the Minister for Health, who have experience of a different aspect of health care. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield worked for many years—perhaps decades—with the people who are the subject of our debate today. A point that he made in a speech to the Committee last week has stuck in my mind. He helped me to clarify a problem which I knew existed but could not resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to, I think, 150,000 people who are in private-sector care, most of whom have never been assessed. They are there because of social pressures. They decided that they wanted to be institutionalised and sought private provision because no other provision was available. They found from the DSS that they had an entitlement, and were admitted to private institutions. I am glad that my hon. Friend explained the situation in those terms. Many of those people should still be in the community, and would be if the services that they require were available in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Accounts Committee, in its report of 26 October 1987 entitled "Community Care Developments", mentioned precisely such matters. I shall refer to paragraphs 5.29 to 5.32, which deal with the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Assessment of the need for care and attention",</p></blockquote>
because I think that they have a direct bearing on the amendments, especially amendment No. 29 which calls for local authorities to comply with all reasonable requests for assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The NAO sought to establish what assessments were made of a person's needs before admission for residential care. They found that LAs placed people in residential care only after individual needs had been assessed and matched against the most appropriate type of care."</p></blockquote>
The principle of care packages and care assessment has already been established, therefore, and I presume that the Bill will tidy up the arrangements. However, the report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For supplementary benefit claimants in private and voluntary residential homes … the DHSS's assessment relates to financial circumstances only. There is no assessment for the need for residential care."</p></blockquote>
There were people in homes, therefore, who may not have required such care provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report further states:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1016</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The NAO found that the absence of such assessment and its implications for value for money caused concern in the DSS".</p></blockquote>
We know about that, and about how that expenditure has in many ways motivated the Government in drafting the Bill. It was of concern
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the Association of Directors of Social Services, the Social Security Advisory Committee … and the Parliamentary Social Services Committee", which commented on it in its second report of the 1984–85 Session.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p> "When, therefore, the Joint Central and Local Government Working Party was set up in February 1984 to consider scope for improving collaboration between the DHSS and LAs … its terms of reference included consideration of the scope for assessing the needs of those entering residential care with the support of supplementary benefit."</p></blockquote>
The Bill may deal with it in the future, but not in the past, and it affects about 146,000 people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two hundred thousand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says 200,000, but I saw the figure of 146,000 and I stand to be corrected.
	<br><blockquote><p> "The Working Party recommended in May 1985 that the multi-disciplinary assessment arrangements used by LAs for admission to their own homes should be extended to those claiming supplementary benefit in private and voluntary homes."</p></blockquote>
To some extent the Bill does that.
	<br><blockquote><p> "However, there should be pilot studies before any such extension and the DHSS thus commissioned the SPRU at the University of York to carry out such studies. The SPRU submitted their findings in a draft report in April 1987. These were based on research in relation to 530 individuals in homes within four local authorities."</p></blockquote>
I shall deal with those findings, because they are relevant to the debate.
	<br><blockquote><p> "The findings disclosed that 93.4 per cent of resdident in receipt of supplementary benefit"—</p></blockquote>
on a sample of 484—
	<br><blockquote><p>"were in need of residential care".</p></blockquote>
Thus it was found that 6.2 per cent were not in need of residential care.
	<br><blockquote><p> "In arriving at this figure the assessors made their judgements on the basis of the existing availability of appropriate support of community care services in the relevant areas."</p></blockquote>
The statistics took account of whether provision was available in the areas, and as provision cannot have been available in many of the areas, the SPRU may have under-estimated the number of people in private residential homes who need not be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continued:
	<br><blockquote><p> "If services such as sheltered housing and day care and more intensive services such as a full-time companion or night sitting service had been available at the time of admission, the above proportion of 93.4 per cent needing care would have dropped to 83.0 per cent."</p></blockquote>
In other words, with wider provision within the community, it is possible that as many as 17 per cent of persons in private and voluntary residential homes would not be there.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1017</span>
	<br><blockquote><p> "If the analysis were restricted to those admitted directly from the community"—</p></blockquote>
on a sample of 238—
	<br><blockquote><p>"rather than from all sources the proportion of 83.0 per cent would have dropped to 77.2 per cent".</p></blockquote>
That leaves 22.8 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two hundred thousand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says 200,000, but I shall work on a conservative estimate of 150,000. According to this report, as many as 30,000 people now in private residential homes need not be there. Those people are in receipt of supplementary benefit, at an average of £200 a head. It represents a figure of about £300 million spent annually, perhaps unnecessarily, on keeping people in privately owned homes, when they could be absorbed into the community if there were provision for them. That is a substantial sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider how the £300 million could be spent. A day centre would be built with the money saved on those benefits, or part of the benefits, because me DSS would be responsible for basic rates of DSS or pension payments. If the greater part of that amount were spent in the community, it would provide all the services that are provided by social service departments, including day facilities, respite facilities and meals on wheels. I imagine that one could transform provision at the community level in a number of years and tempt even more people back into the community, perhaps even from local authority homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that money—from what I have called the specific budget—is spent in the community, those services would be available for other people, who have not entered public or private institutional care. The care assessment arrangements should not relate exclusively to people who will need care assessment in future. They should relate also to those who are already in private institutions. There are many people there who might be tempted back into their homes if the facilities were available and if there were adequate provision for them in their local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I discussed the matter at lunchtime with a colleague, who said that it might seem to be a rosy proposition in principle, but that the problem was that the Government had impaled themselves on a policy that has allowed thousands of businsses to be set up that are dedicated to providing private residential care. With the process of assessment, a lot of trade might be lost, which could have the odd effect of making private residential home owners demand even higher charges to keep their homes viable. I do not know whether that view is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listen to the hon. Gentleman with great care, because he is always interesting if not always accurate, though in this case he is both. I can never understand, however, where he stands on the issue. He spends half the time painting a picture of greedy, unattractive providers of care who tout around trying to cram their homes with under-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1018</span>
assessed people who, if properly care for, would not be in a home at all. The other half of the time he says that because of the way in which the Government will finance the provision all sorts of institutions will be forced out of business as they do not have enough money to keep people in care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People usually set up residential homes because they want to provide a good service for which they perceive a demand. It is unfair of the hon. Gentleman to give the impression that homes are run by people who are desperately worried that they will lose their trade if their clients are properly assessed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The National Audit Office said that there were people in private care who, if assessed, might be able to live in the community, should sufficient resources be made available. If it is correct, my case stands: there will be a drift of people away from private provision and into the community. That would unsettle the proprietors of the businesses. Those businesses have mushroomed over the past ten years on the back of a policy that has directed money towards social security payments and away from adequate provision in the community. I see nothing inconsistent in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield made perhaps the most important speech of the Committee's proceedings, when he raised this matter last week. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I hear murmurs of dissent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay general tribute to my hon. Friends but the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield may have had a little extra to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend drew attention to the fact that tens of thousands of people have not been assessed, are claiming benefit from the state and could be in their homes if proper support services were available. We should ensure somehow in the Bill that those who are in homes and those who may want to go into homes are not treated differently. A request for assessment from whatever source—in principle, the amendments govern all potential areas of reference for assessment—should be met. People should be induced with the prospect of adequate local community support services to return home to lead independent lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly discuss clause 42, including the questions of assessment and whether people should be encouraged to remain in the community or go into nursing homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several recent reports, including reports from the House, have shown that up to 25 per cent of people in residential homes could be cared for in the community. That was acknowledged by the Secretary of State on Second Reading. Both sides of the Committee accept that some people are in residential and nursing homes only because they lack support in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) said, I think, that it was possible to consider packages of care in the community that were cheaper than providing care in residential homes. We must not get it into our minds that care in the community is a cheap option. It would not cost less. It would depend on a range of services. A multitude of disciplines must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1019</span>
come together if we are to provide decent care in the community. It is about providing direct care and adequate housing conditions. For example, if a person who needs care is immobile and lives in a two-up, two-down with the bathroom upstairs, and he needs a bedroom downstairs, the property will have to be adapted to make facilities accessible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell	<div class='memberconstituency'> Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not all members of the Committee agree that the objective is the best and most appropriate package of care for the client, either in residential accommodation or the community? The purpose of the legislation, which I hope will evince itself in practice, is to provide a platform from which the local authority can assess the best way of meeting the interests of each individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Gentleman. That is precisely what we hope the provisions will do,' but, unfortunately, we cannot divorce from that sentiment the need to have the care packages in place and the resources to accompany them. Suppose that a case manager, who must make the assessment, is also the budget holder. He will have one eye on the person's proper needs but the other very much on the budget available for that assessment. The assessment of need should be divorced from the assessment in terms of the budget. If the same person performs both roles, the danges is that the budget will override the needs of the person. If that were the end product of the Government's provisions it would create real difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to consult the carers about assessment. There is a divergence between what the Government said in the White Paper and what the Bill contains. Unfortunately this is an old chestnut in this Committee. The White Paper's recommendation is not followed through into the Bill. Paragraph 3.26 of the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p> "Assessments should take account of the wishes of the individual and his or her carer, and of the carer's ability to continue to provide care, and where possible should include their active participation."</p></blockquote>
It is clear: it is necessary for the carer to be consulted. Yet the Bill not say that. Clause 42(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p> "Where it appears to a local authority that any person for whom they may provide or arrange for the provision of community care services may be in need of any such services, the authority—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) shall carry out an assessment of his needs for those services."</p></blockquote>
The clause places no obligation on the local authority to have consulted the very person without whose presence the system falls apart completely. Unless the carer is adequately catered for, care in the community is meaningless.

The Minister and Secretary of State have said many times in Committee and elsewhere that the vast majority of carers are friends, family, acquaintances and so on. Unless their wishes are taken into account and unless that is provided for in the Bill, there is a danger of falling between two stools. I mentioned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1020</span>
housing needs and it is important to stress that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there has always been a danger that if we subscribe to a multi-disciplinary approach to assessment, it can become an extremely bureaucratic exercise, with no one making provision unless everyone who needs to be consulted is consulted and with vast committees being assembled to deliver the provision of care. I see that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is indicating assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should get away from the idea that the multi-disciplinary approach means large committees meeting regularly to ascertain what packages are available. I am not saying that we should move away from the need to consult, but the process must be more coherent and tightly knit so that it is not always necessary to have bureaucratic structures which are sometimes associated—I said "sometimes associated"; we must be careful about this—with decisions by local authorities and the collaborative process between local authorities and health services. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and others. We need a tightly knit group of people who can take decisions without of necessity always going for the full multi-disciplinary approach from which we have suffered in the past. We agree with the principles of the clause. My plea to the Minister is to give local authorities and others the resources to enable them to carry out proper assessments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a lengthy, thoughtful and relatively constructive debate about a key element of the Bill. As we discussed the proposal, hon. Members thought of the complexities involved. The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) mentioned the dilemma of having to choose between being prescriptive, detailed and bureaucratic and being effective and swift, but thorough. In developing plans for assessment, our guidance will have to steer through the perils on either side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) referred to the statementing process in education, one of the most cumbersome and time-consuming forms of assessment. The Government will not prescribe how local authorities should make the essential assessments. The challenge to local authorities will be to tackle that task within their resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we discuss the amendments, we shall find ourselves in the same position as we were when we talked about plans. Some hon. Members long for government to write a rule book stating precisely how an assessment should be made but social workers would constantly consult the rule book to find out how they could fit in with the fifth clause and second subsection. In practice, that is not the best way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and I spend many years as social workers. I hope that he will agree with me that constant reference to a rule book does not facilitate the best work. We want the assessors to assess and to provide for people within their care. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Cambell-Savours) spoke forcefully about the number
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1021</span>
and Community Care Bill of those at present in residential homes who, according to his study, could have been placed elsewhere. I do not know whether they are still in a condition to leave the residential home. It is not practical for local authorities to undertake a full assessment of all those already in residential care and, apart from that, it may be disconcerting to the residents. There is a good, effective scheme for the 100,000 whom we estimate will need to be assessed in the first year of the Act. It is a big enough task for local authorities to ensure that their assessment procedures are in place and that there are packages of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To continue with the point made by the hon. Member for Workington, people in residential homes who wish to return to the community can request an assessment of their case. We said earlier that the financing and funding arrangements under which they are in residential care will not be altered so long as they remain there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main task for local authorities and for the Bill is to ensure that all the options have been considered in bringing forward guidance for local authorities. The hon. Member for Ynys Mon suggested that there was disparity between the White Paper and the Bill. In the White Paper, the assessment process is spelt out in detail. The care and thought that went into the White Paper, which I commend to hon. Members, will be translated into the guidance to local authorities. The White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The objective of assessment is to determine the best available way to help the invididuals. Assessment should focus positively on what the individual can and cannot do, and could be expected to achieve, taking account of his or her personal and social relationships."</p></blockquote>
The document speaks at length about the importance of the multi-disciplinary approach. In some cases, it will be possible for the social worker or assessor to undertake the assessment alone. In other cases, they may want to involve not only social workers, but GPs, community nurses, hospital staff, people working in psychiatry and rehabilitation, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) would remind me, housing officers and many others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister puts down the document, will she say how the Government intend to deal with paragraph 3.35, because it is relevant to this and future debates on assessment and allocation of resouces?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to the point that was raised by the hon. Member for Ynys Mon, who expressed concern about the person making the assessment being the same as the person who makes the decision about it. There are conflicting views on the matter. In Kent, budgetary control for social workers has worked well; it has enabled them to provide packages of care, and it has made them aware of the resources that are at their disposal. The same trend is increasingly apparent in hospitals, where it is felt that professionals should have greater control and influence over the resources at their disposal. Therefore, I do not share the scepticism of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said time and again, not least by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1022</span>
hon. Member for Workington, my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and others, all the arguments in the past about the use of resources were perverse because the individual making the assessment —or offering advice, because there was no formal assessment—was encouraged to promote residential care. Whatever amount is allowed for care in the community, it will never be large enough, because the numbers are enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington mentioned worries about private homes going out of business. No such worries keep me awake at night. If he looks at paragraph 8.10, he will see that the number of people over 85
	<br><blockquote><p>"are projected to rise from 695,000 in 1986 to 1,146,000 in 2001."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is clear that there will be enough to keep all the services busy—private, voluntary, local authority, domiciliary and day care—and whether or not the task is split between the individual making the assessment and the individual making the final decision, resources will inevitably be the material factor.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the comments of the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke), may I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the remarks of the shadow Chief Secretary, the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs Beckett), in Tuesday's debate on public expenditure? The hon. Lady said that the Labour party was promising
	<br><blockquote><p>"an increase for pensioners and an increase in child benefit. Everything else that is regarded as a desirable aim is also listed, quite clearly and specifically, as something that we hope to do as resources allow.—[	<i>Official Report,</i>] 13 February 1990; Vol. 167, C. 179.]</p></blockquote>
If that is the view of the official Opposition, is it not clear that while we all want more resources for community care, they are offering no more, and perhaps no less, than my hon. Friend and the Government are able to provide at the moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a dramatic increase in the resources allocated to care in the community. I do not want to follow my hon. Friend's example of scoring points about resources and the economic record of respective Governments. We are debating asessment and I do not want to provoke Opposition Members into exchanging facts and figures with which we are only too familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) tabled an amendment that drew attention to the need for urgent assessment when people go into alcohol and drug units. The guidance will recognise that provision is needed for urgent cases. We made it clear that we want the assessments to be effective and swift. It must be understood; however, that assessment relates to a more permanent arrangement of care and, effectively, acceptance by a local authority of a long-term financial responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Is the Minister dismantling a reply that she gave to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order. It may be matter on which the hon. Gentleman may wish to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will remember that we discussed a group of need individuals, for example alcoholics or drug addicts, for whom it had not been possible to secure a package of care in advance. Anxiety was expressed about how local authorities, or the organisations providing such care, could be be satisfied mat their work would not be undermined. I said that I wanted to return to the matter when we discussed assessments. Above all, it is a matter of the assessement being undertaken. When the local authorities or health authorities are establishing their plans, they must make arrangements to deal with emergency cases which can take place prior to the full assessment being undertaken. They have a statutory duty to provide for those who have no other means of support or care. That will be spelt out fully and clearly in the guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for honouring her undertaking to reexamine the issue. The question was whether there will have to be clearance by the DHA before someone is admitted. I take it that when the guidance is produced, that problem will be overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the agencies organise their contracts with local authorities for the work that they undertake, there should be provision for emergencies. Local authorities and health authorities remain under a long-standing statutory duty to provide for those who have nowhere else to go. The assessment is about the long-term financing of a package of care. It is not, in the first week, a long-term package of care; it is an emergency, short-term, temporary arrangement. An assessment can then be made and a longer-term package implemented. There should be no difficulty for the organisations, whose funding has for some time been unpredictable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are investing much energy and effort in ensuring that the guidance on assessment embraces the various options. I shall ensure that the points made in the debate are fed into that process. We are meeting the directors of social services, voluntary organisations and others to ensure that the assessment is workable in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members drew attention to the provision in this clause as opposed to that in the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. The clause states clearly that those who are found to be disabled, that is permanently and significantly handicapped, will be advised of that and their legal rights will continue in precisely the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton mentioned the dangers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is obviously touching on an important point. Can she tell us now, or fairly soon, when the Government intend to implement section 8?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 8 was implemented on 1 April 1987.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. According to the report to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1024</span>
Minister's Department, it is clear that in practice it is not operating. When do the Government intend to make a statement about the operation, the resources, for example? When do they intend to respond to the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report, as the hon. Gentleman is aware, was produced by the social services inspectorate. There will be a conference, in March, to discuss the implications, look at the effects and consider what more can be done to ecnourage good practice. The hon. Gentleman's point applies to much of the discussion about assessment: legislation is not the only factor. There must be changes in behaviour, atttitude and procedure. The clause seeks to persuade people to reconsider received patterns of working and received wisdom and to develop a new ethos of care in the community. In that respect, we hope to have the cooperation and the good will of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) made a good point about section 8. It was made by many other hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) who spoke so powerfully at the beginning of our debate about the assessment procedure. Many hon. Members talked about the vital role of carers. The hon. Gentleman referred to Maureen Oswin, who has been a magnificent champion of the disadvantaged over the years. I have a long acquaintance with her. She has used her moving powers of expression to discuss her plight in caring for an elderly person. She opened people's minds, too, to the predicament of the many children in long-stay mental handicap hospitals. There has been a magnificent change and only a handful are still in mental handicap hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members spoke about the needs of carers and said that it was important not to take their contributions for granted. I echo what was said about the 6 million unsung heroes who willingly, and with much self-sacrifice, dedicate years of their lives—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Heroines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. They are heroines: the majority of carers are women. Often their predicament is not recognised until they reach breaking point. For humanitarian reasons and to make the most effective use of resources it makes sense to meet carers half way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the section in the White Paper that states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Assessment should take account of the wishes of the individual and his or her carer, and of the. carer's ability to continue to provide care, and where possible should include their active participation. Effort should be made to offer flexible services which enable individuals and carers to make choices."</p></blockquote>
The words could not be more unequivocal, and they will be translated into the guidance. The position of carers, which is strongly recognised in the White Paper, will be carried through in the guidance. I hope that mat covers amendments Nos. 754 and 500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 273 and 29 relate to whether the individual should have a right of assessment on request, which is the wording in the Disabled Persons
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1025</span>
(Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. I want to make it clear why the wording in the clause is slightly different. It states that the local authority has a duty to carry out an assessment.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears"—</p></blockquote>
only appears—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… that any person for whom they may"—</p></blockquote>
not shall—
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide or arrange for the provision of community care services may be in need".</p></blockquote>
The authority may then carry out an assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marginal difference is that in discussing an individual's right to claim on assessment, we are talking about a wide range of individuals, some of whom might have peripheral needs. The local authority must safeguard itself in a case in which an individual, might have an unreasonable wish for an assessment. Once an individual becomes a disabled person—the hon. Member for Monklands, West and many other Members agreed that disabled people are an important group—that right is ensured, because if a person is substantially or permanently handicapped, the chance of the request being unreasonable is a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a fine point of drafting, which will, in practice, make little difference. I can conceive of no circumstances in which a local authority that "may" provide an assessment would reasonably refuse such a request from an individual or a carer. In a case in which a request was refused, the Secretary of State would have powers to act when local authorities failed to comply with their duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points arise from the Minister's helpful explanation. First, it would reassure Opposition Members if the hon. Lady could confirm that the assessment procedure can be initiated by someone outside the local authority, that is, by the person who seeks to be assessed. Secondly, if the local authority acts unreasonably, what is the procedure for appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the wording is rather convoluted. The clause provides for circumstances in which it appears to a local authority that anyone for whom it may provide care may be in need. It says nothing about an individual having requested it. The referral or request can come from a number of sources which the local authority then has a duty to assess. Having made an assessment, the authority decides whether the individual's need calls for the provision of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of how dissatisfied clients should respond, I draw the Committee's attention to work on complaints. We have been aware in recent years that social services and health authorities use passive terms such as "clients" or "patients" to describe individuals. It gives them little influence, say or leverage. In using the term "consumers", individuals are perceived to have a say and some rights and influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not argue that at this stage we should lay
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1026</span>
down a complex, cumbersome, bureaucratic appeals process. Major appeals processes create considerable work. They are cumbersome, time consuming and costly. It would not be remotely helpful to local authorities or to those who require services to build such a process into the Bill. We require local authorities to ensure, however, that their complaints procedures are properly advertised and promoted. People should be aware of how to compain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will have received copies of a letter from the chief inspector of the social services inspectorate to the directors of social services. The letter gives details of work currently being undertaken, including investigations into complaints procedures. Having gathered advice and guidance together, work such as promotional activities will be carried out to assist authorities in setting up arrangements. The Secretary of State will need to be satisfied that proper arrangements are in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 274 deals with whether the local authority should have a duty to provide services to meet assessed needs. According to the White Paper, the aim of the assessment is to arrive at a decision on whether those services should be provided and if so, in what form. But those decisions must take into account what is available and what is affordable. The hon. Member for Monklands, West will again bring up the situation of the disabled, because under the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 local authorities have a duty to provide for the domiciliary and day care needs of the disabled. They are a special case. They are people in extreme need, for whom without domiciliary or day care services, residential care has often been the only option. Local authorities will be expected to provide the services for which the assessment calls. No doubt assessment will have an effect on planning, so that local authorities will know where they need to develop more services and provide greater investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) asked about the difficulties of delay. Again, if the Secretary of State believed that the local authority were failing in its duty, he would have the powers provided in clause 44 to take action. We hope to build in a monitoring system, whereby social services and others will be involved in ensuring that standards and targets are reached. No doubt local authorities will want in their plans to talk about their target for the time that assessments should take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton mentioned the problem of housing as well and whether or not it should be part of the Bill. The question of housing is like the question of health. Clearly many who come forward for assessment for community care services will also have housing or health needs. Rather than write into the Bill a requirement to consider them, we think that the right way forward is to put the matter clearly in guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that at the strategic level— we have meetings with our colleagues in the Department of Environment, as we do with the Department of Health, and at the local level —there will be a close working relationship between those in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1027</span>
housing departments and those in health departments. It is clear that if the community care proposals and the assessments are to be effective, collaboration between those agencies is vital. They are equally dependent on each other. It will be important that they can identify named people with whom to make contact, that they collaborate on assessment and that they take into account the ability to bring forward a package of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) referred to training. We are working with the social services inspectorate and meeting the CCETSW, as he said, and local authority associations, such as the ADSS, to talk about the training that local authorities will require. Much of it will be in-service training, and we hope to have more information and guidance for local authorities in the autumn. We all agree that the new scheme will require a change of attitude and of procedures, so we must ensure that the^ necessary training is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given assessment much thought, and it is a crucial tool in our community care plan. I do not think that we shall have the definitive model for assessment by 1 April 1991, but those who need community care will be receiving, by that date, a more comprehensive assessment of their needs than they have had before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next decade we shall learn from our experience, we shall update our guidance, and many examples of good practice among local authorities will emerge which other authorities will be able to copy. It would be wrong while we are embarking on a new model to be overly prescriptive in legislating about the most effective model.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Organisations and individuals who expect the Bill to provide them with a higher standard of assessment and service than before are right to insist on the need to ensure that local authorities will deliver the goods. But my hon. Friend the Minister made it clear that it will be easier to deliver a proper standard of care if less is written into the Bill and more attention is given to guidance. It is—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] The Minister has already assured the Committee that she is making good progress with the guidance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say what he thinks the sanctions might be if local authorities do not comply with the guidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1028</span>
importantly, complaints will be made to the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend has made it clear that when someone is recognised as having a disability—I hope that both physical and social handicaps will be recognised—and no assessment has been forthcoming, that will be a sufficient ground for the Secretary of State to intervene.

My hon. Friend the Minister has not only explicitly spelt out her intention to ensure that local authorities are given guidance on how they should carry out their duties. She has also made it clear that there will be a direct and continuing ministerial interest in the quality of those duties. She spelt out her anxiety, which I share, that we should not put upon local authorities a statutory duty to pursue every request, regardless of whether it is realistic. For that reason I shall seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that some hon. Members would be mindful of the fact that an agreement had been made through the usual channels. I am honouring my part of the agreement on the timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opposition have listened carefully to the debate. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) seems to be very optimistic, and, frankly, we do not share his optimism. The Government's record, and their responses to the issues that we have raised, do not give us cause for optimism. We are still anxious about the important matters relating to carers. I apologise to the Minister for Health for referring to implementation instead of to full implementation. Any confusion about that arose from my contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many professional carers must be greatly worried, and the clause should be clarified with regard to the obligations that they rightly face under The Disabled Persons (Services, Consultations and Representation) Act 1986, especially under Section 8. I shall not press the amendments today, but it is important for the matter to be discussed further on Report, if only because of the Opposition's clear impression that the Government are seeking to place responsibilities on informal carers as a cheap alternative to real

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the reluctance of my hon.

I think that all Committee members are anxious for local authorities to carry out their functions in the spirit of the legislation, rather than feel constrained by its letter. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Health suggested earlier, those who implement the legislation will learn and improve their methods as they go along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that such an approach will leave many uncertainties. In the context of clause 42, such uncertainties will be about how assessments will be carried out and who will carry them out. I cannot believe that the intention is for one person to make the assessment. More than one person is likely to be involved, thereby providing experience of several disciplines which will vary according to the nature of the case. The amendments seek to ensure that all members of a multi-disciplinary team are involved in the assessment process. The concept of case management, which the Bill will introduce, will offer an ideal opportunity for health and local authority personnel to work together in producing plans for the the treatment of individual clients. The White Paper, from which the legislation stems, frequently refers to the need for co-operation between the different authorities and professions. Paragraph 3.2.7 of the White Paper refers to the need to deploy
	<br><blockquote><p>"the involvement, contribution, co-operation and partnership between the local authority and the other authorities and professions involved in providing services. The Government expects all those concerned to contribute positively to such arrangements."</p></blockquote>
That is not specified anywhere in the Bill, only in the White Paper. The danger is that the appropriate people will not be involved in the assessment process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment suggests that the assessment team should have at least some basic elements—at least one nurse, one social worker, one representative of the medical profession and one person representative of any relevant DHA. The assessment team should have some flexibility so that others could be brought in, and it would be important to identify the need for that. The Committee may share my view that a community nurse is especially well qualified and experienced to recognise the need for extra skills to be brought in in the assessment of a particular case.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pursue the specific reference in amendment No. 720 to the involvment of the "health authority". This subject was touched upon in the early hours of Wednesday morning when we discussed the hinge point where health authority and local authority social services actions interface.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) is correct. That is one of the most important and exciting points in the new system. Many of the most interesting new service developments will come from that, drawing upon the new potential of medical and paramedical skills that are being built up in the Health Service and making them available to people in the community. It is where some of the greatest potential of the approach to community care is to be found. That is why the hinge point is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, too, because it is the connection between the two different financing systems. I believe that when my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Chislehurst he was expressing his anxieties that the funding system that will prevail in the Health Service will prevent some exciting services developments from taking place. The system of contracts in the NHS may Well not dovetail into the community care approach operated by the local authority social services. We wish further to explore that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chislehurst is correct. The Bill contains no reference to that hinge point or to how relations are to be conducted between institutions and financing mechanisms at the point of connection between community health care services operated by the health authorities and local authority social services. That is most important and I commend amendments No. 719 and 720. If they were accepted, the Bill would include that point of connection at one of the most important places that it could be made—the assessment of the person. Indeed, I should like it to apply to other areas such as financing and funding. Nevertheless, if amendment No. 720 were accepted, a point of connection would be included where people and their needs are dealt with. There could not be a

I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Wales to the Committee. Perhaps he will give us the benefit of the splendid guidance that he has apparently issued and upon which his hon. Friend the Minister had to rely in the early hours on Wednesday morning because she had nothing to offer for England. She relied on Welsh guidance. Perhaps we can hear more about how such guidance is to commend the connection between the health authority services and the local authority social services, which amendment No. 720 seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ian Grist)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My fellow central city Member, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins)—the great difference is that he represents his side and I represent mine in these central matters—is right. We have a little more experience in Wales in working between the different authorities, just as I manage to wear the hats of both housing and health Minister and find a unity of purpose in that respect. That is another matter which, I find, I may be talking about it in a social services Committee in the near future. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be interested in my answers there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) will not be surprised if I say that his proposal is a little bureaucratic and top heavy. Unfortunately, he did not hear my hon. Friend the Member for Daventy (Mr. Bosell) this morning refer to a rigmarole of assessment. In a sense, that is what my hon. Friend would promise. Indeed, our hon. Friend the member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) said that assessments could vary from the small to the large. The small could simply be a social worker finding that a carer needed to have shopping done once a week, and so an assessment could be carried out by one person. It need not necessarily be carried out by a huge team. The answer is not to have an enormous team on each case, as my hon. Friend the member for Chislehurst seems to suggest. In some cases it might be advisable, but such a provision should not be included in the Bill. Perhaps he would consider withdrawing his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detailed guidance on carrying out assessments will be issued before the end of the year. We are consulting and ascertaining how those in the field view the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister can have read amendments Nos. 719 and 720. They do not require that in each case the entire assessment team, involving the four agencies, should be brought to bear.

It is neither cumbersome nor bureaucratic. Moreover, I fail to understand how the system will operate such teams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause states that the local authority will carry out an assessment and the hon.

Minister. I was disadvantaged by not hearing part of this morning's discussion because I was attending the memorial service for Laurie Pavitt, who would probably have been with us in Committee had he been alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We still face the problem of not knowing until quite late in the year who will be responsible for carrying out the assessment. I am worried that some people will be inadequately assessed, and that they will be given the wrong care because they are not seen by people who, if unable to make the right assessment themselves, will know where to find someone who can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, we have to wait and see what the guidance will be, I should like to give further thought to that matter, especially to the important point that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) made about involving the health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boundaries of my local health authority, are coterminous with those of the local authority. The authorities have a close working relationship. We are in a happy position in that the chairman of the social services committee is also the chairman of the local health authority. We are doing things already that are way ahead of what is suggested in the White Paper and the Bill. Other authorities may not operate in the same way, but I hope that they will come and look at what we are doing for their own guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that event, I hope that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I suggested that when I spoke to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My dilemma is that I cannot yet find a way between rigidly laying down regulations and having nothing other than an assurance of some sort of guidance at some time. We should try to find a way of resolving that dilemma. However, it is not fruitful to pursue the matter further now, and I shall not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the early hours of Wednesday morning an important point was made, and it needs to be pressed again. In reply then, the Minister referred us to subsequent detailed guidance. If we are to have sensible discussions on the bill, it is important for that detailed guidance to be made available to Committee Members. We shall not have carried out our duties responsibly if we leave everything to be resolved at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that an awkward request to make because I am aware of asking the Under-Secretary of State for Wales to supply that guidance when he has already issued it in Wales. It is not unknown for English Members to look to the Welsh for rescue, and I am happy to do so on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an assurance from the ministerial team that the detailed guidance, which will explain the connection between the health authority workers and local social services authority workers who will carry

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1035</span>
Our worry is that in Government language the term "community care services" includes institutional care. Amendment No. 644 would ensure that those responsible for assessment would have a duty to consider options to institutional care in each case. My fear, which I have expressed at length in Committee, is that Government policy has created a built-in bias in favour of institutional care. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) spoke about that at length earlier this afternoon. Government policy should encourage independent living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When training to be a social worker 20 years ago I read a book called "The Last Refuge", and no doubt the Minister for Health has read it too. It was written in 1962 by Peter Townsend, a well-known member of the Labour party—that is incidental.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know it well. Peter Townsend was my professor at university, and the reason I went to his university was to study under him. Indeed he secured me my first job at the Child Poverty Action Group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that his politics did not make more of an impression on the hon. Lady. "The Last Refuge" had a major impact in the early 1960s and it continues to be recommended reading for social work trainees nearly 30 years after its publication. The book was a study of residential institutions for elderly people. Townsend examined in detail the lives of those people and concluded that many homes "do not adequately meet the physical, psychological and social needs of the elderly people living in them and that alternative services and living arrangements should quickly take their place."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Peter Townsend argued in 1962 that the institutional model was questionable, and that options should be considered to keep people out of institutions. Nearly 30 years later, Townsend's comments have more meaning than ever because the Government have engineered an explosion in institutional living. That is the motivation behind the amendment. The free market experiment in comunity care has resurrected the institution model and, more seriously, has diverted resources from the alternative services to which Townsend pointed to in 1962.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 644 is about keeping people out of institutional care whenever possible. It wants priority to be given to maintaining people in their own homes and communities when that is possible. It is about choice, which is mentioned in the White Paper. Most people would choose to remain in their own homes with their own families in the areas where they have lived all their lives. I do not know many who would make a positive choice to enter a home if there were options that would enable them to remain in the community. Choice is an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of amendment No. 644, I remind the Minister that the Wagner report in recommendation 2 on page 115 states:
	<br><blockquote><p> "A statutory duty should be placed on local authorities to propose a reasonable package of services enabling a person to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1036</span>
remain in their own home if that is their choice and it is reasonable for them to do so."</p></blockquote>
That is the central purpose of amendment No. 644.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 646, 334 and 331 have similar aims and a common motivation. They seek to ensure consistency in social work practice in a range of differing clients groups. That is especially important when children and dependent adults require certain services. My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) and one or two Conservative members of the Committee served with me on the Committee which considered the Children Bill. It is perhaps more apparent to us than to others that there are major inconsistencies in the laws relating to elderly and handicapped people and those relating to children, who may be similarly institutionalised and removed from independent living. We want the laws relating to elderly and handicapped people and others covered by the legislation to reflect the principles set out in child care legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak about the principles underlying amendment No. 646 by dealing with each subsection. New subsection (6) recognises that a one-off requirement for an assessment is insufficent. We want the Bill to include a requirement for re-assessment and a formal review, as there is when a child is taken into care. A child is not taken into care and forgotten about. In law, a statutory review is required after a certain period and a regular review is made in less than six months to check the circumstances and to review the decisions that have been taken in respect of that child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for new subsection (6) will be obvious to anyone who has considered the circumstances of a child or an adult who may enter care. People may be admitted to care one week and the following week their circumstances may have changed markedly. I know of numerous cases in which that has happened. In many instances, I am pleased to say the changes were for the better. People who struggle to live independently in the community may go into a home and with appropriate nutrition and physical care respond and become physically capable of doing far more than they were able to do on admission. When people go into care, their bodily needs are looked after. It might be discovered when a person is having a bath that when he was living in his own home he could not cut his toenails himself, which meant that he could not walk properly as the toenails have grown and dug into his feet. Once the toenails are cut, that person is mobile. It might be as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have come across people who have been deemed deaf or confused. The problem was that they had wax in their ears and could not hear properly. A physical assessment of a person's needs may result in his or her circumstances being changed completely within a matter of days or weeks when the person responds to the treatment and care that he is given. The options to institutional care thus need to be reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly the circumstances of an individual living in the community may change, perhaps only a week after assessment. For example, someone may lose a partner who has been a major source of support. In that case,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1037</span>
his or her circumstances may change radically. A neighbour may no longer be available to help. As my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West said, many neighbours become carers. They are a rich a source of support to many poeple who have to depend on others in the community. Amendment No. 334 restates the need for reassessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (7) in amendment No. 646 follows amendment No. 644 in attempting to ensure that clear thought is given to institutional placements and that reasons are given why such provisions is in the best interests of the individual. It would ensure safeguards when recommendations are made for people to enter residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (8) would introduce a statutory requirement for every individual in institutional care to have a named social worker responsible for his or her case. Amdendment No. 331 would make the same provision. My experience in social work is that adults who are placed in institutional care are frequently forgotten because of the pressures on social workers. It worries me that the Government assume that social workers will always be there to assess people in need. In reality, vast numbers of statutory child abuse cases are not allocated a social worker because none is available for that work. We should be aware of the realities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I lose my temper with hon. Members whose views are unrealistic, it is because I know that social workers do not exist in many authorities. There is no one to make the asssessments that we have glibly talked about today and the Government are doing nothing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are placed in institutional care and forgotten. Each person in institutional should have a named social worker who is responsible for his or her case, to advocate their needs, to ensure that there is outside supervision and monitoring of his circumstances or problems and to take responsibility for the reviewing procedure that the amendments propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) spoke with feeling as an experienced social worker. I think that he would agree that a social worker is not specifically required in every case, but that a professional should work alongside people who need care perhaps, for example, a health worker, the admendments do not allow such flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 644 is otiose in the sense that the tenor and purpose of the Bill is to make it possible for people to remain in the community as long as they can and wish to do so. The point of our proposed change in the funding system is to break away from the present perverse system which puts a premium on people moving into residential care. There should be a system, which is the one that we propose, whereby money will be available to help people remain in their own homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the point that divides the Committee is not the principle that the Under-Secretary has just annunciated, but the question of certainty that it will work in practice. If the Under-Secretary is suggesting that there are drafting problems, or other limitations with the amendments, will he at least tell us how the Government intend to ensure that the reservations that he has expressed will be dealt with in practice? How can we be certain that the real and practical fears that have been expressed will be overcome?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill and all the White Papers, discussions and talks and the guidance that will be given to local authorities on how to handle this part of the Bill will and do display our purpose, which is as I have annunciated. We need not go over that again because it is at the heart of the Bill and has been often explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 334 and 646 are too mechanistic. Of course, we want to see the development of case management in local authorities, as was mentioned earlier, but to enshrine in law the requirement that there should be a named social worker for every person in residential accommodation is going too far. We are working with social services authorities to develop good practice in case management. We do not want to prescribe the precise way in which that should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The correct method should be decided upon in the light of local needs, and the availability of staff and resources. Often the social worker will be the appropriate person to deal with the matter. But, with nursing home care and other forms of care, nurses or other health professionals might be better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want regular reviews, which have been called for, and we want assessment results to be given to the client in writing as normal practice. It would be wrong to enshrine such reviews in legislation in the inflexible way that has been called for. It must be right to leave local authorities to decide upon the practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will be dealing with a huge range of needs and clients. They might need to review frequently cases in which clients need considerable help; for instance, those who have considerable disabilities who are going to live at home. They will have to do that more often than the amendment would require them to. Some people will need little assistance, and will need to be infrequently reported on by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy with the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) when he said that the authority should explain in writing why a residential placement is assessed to be best for a client. I would expect there to be a written procedure for almost all such cases. Departmental guidance will cover that important point. Once again, however, it should be left to the local authority to find the best form of communication. The procedure should not be set rigidly into legislation. We would expect such explanations normally to be in writing, and that will be our advice to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Secretary's response. We are becoming used to such responses. As yet, we have not had an encouraging or realistic response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the issues that have been voiced. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), mentioned 30,000 people who were in institutional care and who did not need to be. I suspect mat there are nearer 50,000 such people. There are vast numbers of people with public subsidies in institutional care who do not need to be. They could more easily be cared for in the community. The Under-Secretary nods his agreement. Given the circumstances, I fail to understand why he objects to giving the people who will undertake assessments a duty to consider options to institutional care. Our request is reasonable and realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary gave the Government away in his reasons for resisting the amendment about named social workers. He mentioned local need and the availability of staff and other resources at local level. He said, in other words, that it may not be realistic, and I understand why that may be so. The Government have allowed to develop a situation in which many local authorities, both Conservative and Labour, lack social workers, even to do basic jobs on statutory cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a major problem is that case workers too often move quickly from one case load to another, and that frequently they do so to pursue their careers? Does he agree also that a career-grading system for social workers has not yet got off the ground to the extent that we can look for continuity, and that for that reason a named social worker would not be a viable possibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I partly agree, and the matter could be debated at length. The issue has worried me over a long period. It relates also to social work training, and especially to the resources available to local authorities to enable them to recruit social workers. I have mentined before that Humberside is trying to recruit social workers by offering them £2,000. It is desperate because it has been criticised for lacking appropriate responses in child care cases. The criticism stems from the fact that it cannot resource the cases with which it has to deal. I am worried that the Government have based their response on the resourcing question rather than on a concern for human beings, which should be the basis of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that cases will be reviewed in certain circumstances. But that will not happen unless there is a legal requirement. Until fairly recently—it may still be the case—statutory review for children in care did not take place because people were too busy. Review will not happen if there is no legal requirement, no criticism, and no monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very disappointed with the Government's response. The issues—they are not party-political-relate to the treatment of vulnerable people in the care of society. I shall not press the amendments because my hon. Friends and I intend to return to the issues on Report. I hope that the Government will reconsider,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1040</span>
and realise that we have proposed a series of realistic amendments which should be included in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 796, in page 42, line 9, after "services", insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>"with such assessments taking account of the needs of people of ethnic minority origin".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would require those undertaking assessments, be mey social workers or others, to take account of the needs of ethnic minorities. That should be an obvious consideration, but it is important to remind ourselves of the issues involved when dealing with people from ethnic minorities. It is vital to realise that people from other cultures have different perceptions of what might be appropriate in community care services. Lady Wagner considered such evidence, especially that relating to the elderly and children. The evidence pointed to the likelihood that the number of elderly people from ethnic minorities will increase greatly over the next few years. I hope that hon. Members will bear that in mind when considering the proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know some areas of West Yorkshire where there have been such problems, and I am worried that some of the existing models of provision for community— especially institutional—care may be inappropriate. I have met people from ethnic minorities whose placement in care was questionable because the staff in the institutions had no idea how to care for their individual needs. Language is a problem. I have met Asian people who were placed in homes where no one could communicate with them in their own tongue, and they lived very lonely lives. They were isolated from their own communities, and no one had the training or commitment to explain to them what was happening or to ascertain their needs and feelings. For instance, in diet and so on, specific provision is often required. The amendment would ensure that such needs are taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an extremely serious and important observation. In terms of quality of life and people's morale, there could not be a more important one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to my hon. Friend the example of Newcastle. For many years, some of its residential homes have provided kosher food for people of the Jewish faith. A similar facility has been extended to people from other minority cultures and religions. Such good practice—it is incredibly expensive to provide, as can be seen if the day-to-day details are examined— should not be lost sight of in the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We should not forget such matters. When examining the issue of assessments for people with different needs, we should perhaps consider the need to develop new models of provision. The institutional model may be completely in appropriate in many instances; but in many communities—certainly in my area, where they are people of Asian origin—we should pay special attention to the importance of supporting the family

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1041</span>
network rather than replacing it, as, unfortunately, often happens. Amendment No. 796, which I hope the Government will accept, reminds us of those important considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs Alice Mahon	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have dealt with one of two such cases because Halifax has a large Asian community. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) mentioned a new model and that is what we should be considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Asian community has extended family networks. Given that, it may be eminently sensible to consider moving way from residential care. It has no history of elderly people within the family being placed elsewhere and it thinks it strange when we talk about such practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One distressing case was an elderly couple who were both hospitalised. It opened my eyes to the problems involved and the lack of a programme and plan for such cases. They were desperate to get out of hospital and their families were desperate to get them out. However, having examined the social service provision, we could offer little as a package to help that couple to live in dieir own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar case involved an Asian family with two very mentally and physically disabled children. Simply obtaining respite care for the day and the occasional weekend proved quite difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assessments and new packages are vital in such circumstances. There have been quite a lot of young immigrants, especially in the Asian community. Obviously people often want to emigrate when they are young, and then build up their families. We have not encountered the problem until recently but now it is growing. Even though such communities may have not wanted residential care in the past, and notwithstanding my earlier observations, perhaps there should be some provision in the future. Clearly, assessment must involve interpreters and someone who understands a community's culture, which may be very different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Bill Walker	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a frivolous intervention. As a Scot, does the hon. Lady consider that the members of the Free Church of Scotland should have their special interests taken into account? If she does not, she is trying to create different categories in society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention is not worthy of a response. We are discussing a serious issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ethnic minorities have been neglected by social services and local authorities, although not deliberately. There have been faults on both sides because the ethnic minorities have not asked for much. My local authority reviewed the services that were offered to the local Asian community and discovered that they took little advantage of any service that was offered. We considered printing material about what the social services offered in Urdu and Gujerati to make it more accessible to the Asian community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should seriously consider the assessment that is proposed. I hope that this important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1042</span>
amendment will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and for Halifax (Mrs Nahon) spoke on an important subject. I represent a constituency with the most Commonwealth immigrants and the largest Jewish community in Wales. I am therefore aware of the issues that the hon. Members raised and sympathise with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember visiting my father in hospital, many years ago. In the bed next to thim was an Indian seaman, whose language was incomprehensible to the staff until an uncle of mine turned up who could speak Hindi. The hospital called on him on subsequent occasions to interpret. I was a youngster at the time, and seeing how lost the poor seaman was in our society made quite an impression on me. Like many British people, I though that English was God's tongue and that everyone should be able to speak it. That is a great mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making assessments local authorities should have full regard to the needs of ethnic minority and national interests. Health departments will make that crystal clear in the guidance on assessments. We believe that they will live up to that professional guidance because they will have helped to draw it up; it is not necessary for it to be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for taking the issue more seriously than his hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), whose attitude was insulting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall not give way. The Minister took the issue seriously. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs Mahon) gave way to the hon. Gentleman but the intervention was insulting to the serious nature of the debate.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 715, in page 42, line 10, after "decide", insert "at Chief Officer level".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 649, in page 42, line 12, at end add "and,"

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments arise directly from experience of problems that may occur in community care and social work settings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 715 would insert the words, "at Chief Officer level".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that it is not suggested that a local authority chief officer should spend all his or her
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1043</span>
time taking decisions on this matter. The purpose is to ensure that decision-making on the allocation of resources comes to the appropriate level in the authority. The amendment tackles an issue briefly touched on in an earlier group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Case management and resource management have not been dealt with adequately in the Bill nor in debate. In the earlier debate, the Minister dealt with the issue cursorily, which made me believe that she may not have understood the seriousness of the argument. She suggested that there were conflicts of view in case management. That is not really true among those with experience of the problems that can arise in matching resources to assessments. Packages of care, to which the Minister referred, can be acceptable if the resources over which the professionals have control are adequate and sufficiently flexible to do the job. No doubt the whole Committee will accept that there will be difficulties in the generality with adequacy of resources. There will certainly be specific cases, and I shall mention some examples, when the resource requirements are considerable and therefore cannot be adequately budgeted for when allocating to teams or individual case managers. The decision-making process must be clear and able to cope with such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the place for any conflicts of view, such as those which the Minister apparently believes exist, to be clarified and resolved. It is not enough to say that the matters will be dealt with in the guidance notes. I believe that the import of the Minister' remarks was that the guidance must get it right. However, that guidance is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Government guidance often gets things wrong in a way that would not happen if it was properly discussed and debated before being issued and if the advice of those experienced in such matters—some Opposition Members have direct experience—was taken into account when formulating the guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I trust that the availability of a particular brand of peppermint will enable the Minister to concentrate on the argument. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I hope that the issue will not be dealt with flippantly, as has happened in several debates. The amendment is extremely serious and the subject is one which the Minister has not yet seriously considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that it was the Minister who made any assessemnt of what she was or was not eating. That was a flippant remark made by someone else, was it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made that remark because it seems difficult to attract the Minister's attention. I hope that I need not make further similar remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses show something of the problem. On clause 42, they state:
	<br><blockquote><p> "Subsection (1) requires the local authorities to assess the care needs of any person appearing to them to be in need of community care services and to decide in the light of the assessment whether to provide services."</p></blockquote>
But they do not say who will decide on the provision of those services or how that will be carried through.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1044</span>
The notes on clauses also state:
	<br><blockquote><p> "Subsection (5) defines "disabled person", "local authority" and "community care services" for the purpose of this clause."</p></blockquote>
It does, but it does not do so adequately. The subsection gives a limited and unsatisfactory definition of "disabled person" if the Bill is to cover the entire range of community care needs. That shortcoming has been identified several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not define the local authority or carers for the purpose of the legislation. It certainly does not define them in a way that makes sense in practice. The clause refers back to clause 41(2), which states that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"'local authority' means the council"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'community care services' means services which a local authority may provide or arrange to be provided under any of the following provisions".</p></blockquote>
It then gives a list. In other words, the care to be provided is defined by statute, not be need. Moreover, the local authority is defined, but not the mechanism by which or person by whom the resources will be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of caring for people. I refer again to paragraph 3.3.5 of the White Paper, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government also sees advantage in linking case management with delegated responsibility for budgetary management. This need not be pursued down to the level of each individual client in all cases, but—used flexibly—is an important way of enabling those closest to the identification of client needs to make the best possible use of the resources available."</p></blockquote>
That cannot be right unless the size of the budget and the resources available are adequate for the case manager to be sure of working flexibly within a budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming to the House, I was a magistrate and chairman of the juvenile bench in Cardiff which, I believe is one of the largest juvenile benches in the country. I saw the result of legislation introduced in the late 1960s. In theory, decision-making was placed with the social worker. That was the expectation of the legislation. But what happened? Care decisions were not taken by social workers because the resources were not available. They were taken by a clerk, a bureaucrat. That was the inevitable consequence of the mechanisms that followed from that legislation. The intention was to give the social worker greater authority to deal with a case and make appropriate disposals. But, in practice, the result was clerical decisions, which were often completely inappropriate to the needs of the person as well as to the judicial needs being pursued in the magistrates' court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a magistrate, I recall on many occasions being told that contact had been made with the administration of a local authority and that a particular course, which everyone thought was in the interests of a person, could not be followed. The social worker had reported to the court, but the court was completely powerless
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1045</span>
because the decision-making was subject to administrative constraints. The decision did not have to reach that policy level within the local authority, as the amendment seeks, where the conflict between service needs and resources needs would have become clear and where a policy decision would have had to have been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case management idea, expressed in paragraph 3.3.5, is attractive in some circumstances, but only if resources can be made available. I understand the argument for assessment, case management and resource management being at the same place, but not resource allocation where there may be a conflict of interest between different clients or where resources available may be inadequate for a particular need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government intend to make the case manager the resource allocator, too? The Minister should answer that question because it is not clear in paragraph 3.3.5. If that is so, will the case manager have unlimited resources? That would produce problems and distortions elsewhere in the local authority system. It will not be practical. A senior decision should be taken at a senior level, where policy and practice come together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it is necessary to avoid the assessor being judge and jury in the allocation of resources. If, in making an assessment, an individual has to consider the resource allocation, it will distort the judgment. Assessment of need should be clear and untrammelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the social worker at the end of the line should not be cast as a social fund officer who tells people who need help at the end of the year, "Tough. No money is available." I do not believe that that is what the Government intend, but that is what will result unless our reservations are taken into account in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a buzz of conversation on both sides of the Committee which is making it difficult for me to hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision on the allocation of resources must be taken at a higher, policy decision level, which will ensure that the system is properly monitored. That cannot be done at case management or field work level. Chapter 3.3.5 of the White Paper recognises that there is a difficulty but it does not tell us how it could be resolved in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not result in the director of social services sitting at his desk and taking personal decisions in every case. It would ensure however, that decisions on the allocation of resources would be taken at a strategic level and that the director of social services would be personally accountable. On behalf of the authority, he or she would ensure that there was a proper process to assess the resources needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of examples have been given which underline the importance of resource allocation. I referred earlier to Colin Griffiths, a young man who became tetraplegic after being injured in a tragic
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1046</span>
accident. Such an individual needs to be assessed properly, as a whole person with the will to live an independent life and to do things for others. If the allocation of resources depends on the person who manages the cases, there will be tremendous artificial constraints on the assessment. The result of the assessment should be considered by someone at a higher policy level. The local authority can then decide on the allocation of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have been given examples of brain damage that cause physical and mental handicap, making appropriate placement extremely difficult. Higher flexible funding is necessary for residential care in those cases, or for care in the community. For such cases to be properly dealt with, the final decision should be taken at resource allocation level—policy-making level—in the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Spinal Injuries Association said:
	<br><blockquote><p> "We do not agree with much of what the White Paper says about case managers. In our view it is absolutely essential that a case manager is not a budget holder. If the role of the case manager is to give independent and impartial advice to people requiring service provision, he or she would be unable to do this under the constraints of a budget. Ideally case managers should be independent of all service providers."</p></blockquote>
Another example of a more day-to-day nature is that of a social worker in a generic team who goes to visit someone whose recent discharge from hospital was followed by a call from a social worker in the hospital-based team. Is that a mandate for assessment or not? I suspect that we agree that it should be a mandate for assessment, but it is not clear. I hope that the Minister will give her view when she responds to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that in that case the social worker decides that the individual needs a lift in the house which will cost perhaps £3,000, which is relatively modest. With that assessment, does the social worker have the right to spend? It appears that the social worker may have a duty under the Act as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phraseology of the Bill is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it decides to a local authority".</p></blockquote>
Who decides and who allocated? If it goes wrong, who is blamed? Might it be left to the social worker or the administrator, or someone without the professional knowledge of the case? Might it be left to the committee? I suspect that Conservative Members might not be too happy if there were a return to committee decisions on such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of local authority in the Bill does not answer the question who takes the decision at the end of the day. There have been cases in which an individual has been assessed at social work level as being in need of a wheelchair. But the resource allocation has meant that the person has been put on a waiting list until a wheelchair is available because there is no money. The development of community care should not mean that someone has to wait until another person has died before being provided with a wheelchair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been cases in which a legal assessment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1047</span>
of need was required and a student has been sent to assess whether an elderly person required the use of a telephone. Although the opinion was that the person would benefit from having a telephone, the resource allocation was such that the elderly person's name was put on a list below other priority cases and had to wait for a couple of years because there was no money. For that reason, it is important that we consider-how the result of an assessment will be put into practice when resources are allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion that followd the Green Paper was important but the answers are not provided in the Bill. We do not know who will carry out the assessments, and what they will do, or what will follow in terms of action and resource allocation. It will be very worrying if that is left to the guidance notes and regulations. As my hon. Friend the member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said, 80 per cent of what is important in the Children Act 1989 is left to regulations and guidance notes. There is much uncertainty about how the Act will be implemented. We do not want that uncertainty to apply to elderly people and others affected by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are glad that the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) did not need assessment as the result of his unfortunate accident the other day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will be legally responsible if, following the assessment, no one implements the advice that is contained within the assessment? The amendment proposes that the chief officer is charged with the duty of implementation: that is what happens with most responsibilities that are allocated by Parliament to local authorities or by local authorities to their officers. Assessment will be an empty gesture unless a decision is taken on how the need will be met and who will be responsible for implementing the result of the assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Both amendments appear somewhat pedantic because duties placed on a social services authority—as the duty of assessment will be—are, by definition, placed on the director of social services. He holds a statutory position entirely different from other local authority directors.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to pass to the hon. Gentleman the sentence in the White Paper which gives rise to our concern and which we hope the Minister will clarify, preferably by accepting one or other of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1048</span>
amendments. The White Paper has caused our concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I gave way to the hon. Gentleman to enable him to clarify that he was quoting from the White Paper. While he was speaking, I read the clause carefully. The clause places a duty on the local authority and thus on the statutory director of social services. Therefore, the amendments are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, if we expected every statutory duty placed on a social services authority to be taken by the director of social services or
	<br><blockquote><p>"a named offer of senior rank",</p></blockquote>
as suggested in amendment No. 649, we should remove incentives for others to use their initiative. That would probably cut right across the delegations made by social services committees to other officers within the authority. In any event, as all officers working for the social services authority are answerable for their actions to the social services committee through the director of social services, the amendments are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a long explanation of why the amendments were tabled, but no explanation of why it was wished to go beyond the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, which sets out the duties of a social services director.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) set out a coherent argument for amendment No. 715. Perhaps I may outline our reasons for tabling amendment No. 649.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 649 follows very much along the lines of amendment No. 644 and the other amendments grouped with it, which we discussed earlier. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) obviously did not understand the motivation behind amendment No. 649. It is important to regard the institutional placement of a person as a serious step, as no doubt the hon. Gentleman will agree. It is a serious step for the person, who loses his liberty. He may lose his home and personal possessions; his home may be sold when he moves into care. That person is moved away from his family and community and may be placed in what, in his view, is a strange and possibly hostile environment. It is also an important step in terms of resources, for the reaons set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that, in many instances, the recommendation for institutional care is inappropriate. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) referred to the Audit Commission and to the Public Accounts Committee's conclusion that nearly a quarter of those in institutional care need not have been there. There is the public cost of such placements. But perhaps more important is the cost to people whose liberty and independence are taken away from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that, in the assessment process, the social worker is the gatekeeper for a vast

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1049</span>
amount of resources. Through amendment No. 649, we highlight the need for consistency between different client groups. For instance, the decision to take a child into care is monitored by a senior officer and so there is accountability. The same process should apply to an adult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happiply concede that the that underlying theme is to steer people way from institutional care. I am proud to boast that that is the Opposition's aim. The Government have allowed far too many people who should not be there to go into institutional care and I hope that they will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) appear to have advanced the same argument for different reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards placing people in residential care, there are many arguments for encouraging a sense of case management linked with budgetary management. It is because of that perverse incentive that the usually costly provision of institutional care has been the chosen option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
