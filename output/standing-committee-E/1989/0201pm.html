<p>Amendment proposed [this day]; No. 13, in page 16, line 25, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'but there will be no sanction, financial or otherwise, applied against a practice which exceeds its indicative drug budget'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are talking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 615, in page 16, line 36, leave out subsection (4) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) The members of a practice shall aim to keep the basic price of the pharmaceutical services ordered or supplied by them or on their behalf within the indicative budget notified to the practice for that year under subsection (1) above; but nothing in this subsection shall interfere with a medical practitioner's decision to supply pharmaceutical services according to his clinical judgement.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 14 in page 16, line 36, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'with the consent of the relevant Family Practitioner Services Authority or'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 15, in page 17, line 8, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(8) The Family Practitioner Services Authority shall not withold the remuneration of any practitioner for exceeding the indicative drug budget notified to that practice.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Minister's response this morning was self-contradictory. Medical audits and the existing disciplinary procedures should be used to deal with under and over-prescription. The amendments do not interfere with those procedures. Unless the amendments are accepted, a doctor could lose pay for exceeding his drug budget. If the Government do not intend that to happen the Minister must accept the amendments, as assurances not in the Bill do not count.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State asked the BMA to accept such assurances he said,
<br><blockquote><p>"These points will of course be carried through into our legislative proposals to Parliament."</p></blockquote>
That promise will be kept only if the Minister accepts the amendments. We feel that they are so important that they must be pressed to a vote, if they are not accepted by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the Minister's reply this morning; I noticed that amendment No. 268, in the name of the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones), deals with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 648</span>
prescribing costs and transfer charging between hospitals and GPs, of which I have spoken. As the Minister did not mention that subject this morning will she do so when we reach amendment No. 268?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister For Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones), and to assist the Committee, I shall respond to the important point raised by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). There has been a misunderstanding. Consultants have been requesting GPs to take responsibility for the prescription of drugs in hospitals. The key point is that money should not play a part in such decisions. The only important factor should be who has clinical responsibility. If that lies with consultants, they should prescribe the drugs. However, if GPs are competent to undertake the treatment, they should prescribe the drugs. There should be no doubt about that; we are asking RHAs to ensure that that is clear.<br><br>
Hon. Members have expressed anxieties about drugs for needy groups, and about hormone replacement therapy patients. But there is not reason why any drug should not be prescribed if there is a clinical need. The responsibility for prescription will lie with the person who has clinical responsibility for the patient.<br><br>
I shall not respond further on the argument, except to say that we welcome medical audit. On an earlier clause we spoke of medical audit advisory committees being associated with family health service authorities. The indicative budget builds on all that we have learnt in recent years from the excellent work of the PACT scheme, and it will be an extra management tool to draw attention to possible areas of over-prescribing. There are no new sanctions, but the clause will ensure that the sanctions in the 1974 regulations are implemented.<br><br>
We are having discussions with the general medical services committee and other bodies in an attempt to make the sanctions more effective and to gain the confidence of both the public and the profession.<br><br>
I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, and that my hon. Friends will resist the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's explanation seems to make a distinction between the world as it is and the world as we should like to see it. Even if the Bill is passed in its present form, I doubt whether GPs will be able to avoid prescribing regularly for patients who are under the jurisdiction of consultants. Patients may find it more convenient to visit their local GP than the hospital for repeat prescriptions. The Department of Health may not want that to happen, but it happens already, and is likely to continue; and that has implications for indicative budgets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such difficulties are mainly procedural and result from poor communications. They will be resolved more easily under the Bill because family health services authorities will have a managerial relationship with RHAs, as DHAs do at present. We shall continue to press for such matters to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0699">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 649</span>
be clarified. There is no doubt that it is distressing for patients to feel that their case is being pushed from one medical practitioner to another. The person who prescribes should be clinically responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall see what happens.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 455, in page 16, line 25, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) In determining the amount referred to in subsection (1) above, the Family Health Services Authority shall take into account the numbers of persons on the list of patients of each general practitioner who are children under five years of age, elderly, chronically sick or disabled.'.</p></blockquote>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will reassure patients that the way in which indicative budgets are built up will not pose problems for their treatment. I take the example of cystic fibrosis sufferers, of whom there are only 6,000 in Britain. Cystic fibrosis, like several other illnesses, is expensive to treat: the prescripion costs can amount to £1,000 a month. The cystic fibrosis trust is understandably anxious to know how indicative budgets for GPs who treat patients with cystic fibrosis will be built up.<br><br>
Often, a patient suffering from cystic fibrosis will go to hospital for treatment, and to a GP only for repeat prescriptions. The GP may not, therefore, have direct contact with the illness. The cystic fibrosis trust, and other trusts that represent chronically sick people with illnesses that require expensive treatment, want an assurance, which I hope that my hon. Friend will give, that GPs' budgets will take into account the cost of such prescriptions. Will she explain the method by which an indicative budget will be arrived at. To what extent will it be formula-based on the catchment area; and to what extent will it be built on real patients who are being treated by the GP to take account of the current high cost of treatment for GPs whose lists are unrepresentative and include a number of expensive patients?<br><br>
Those are the problems, of which I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister is aware, and I hope that her response will assure patients that the new regime will take full account of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Couchman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be pertinent to mention a matter which I raised with my hon. Friend the Minister for Health this morning, to which she did not have time to respond. It concerns the consultation that is to take place between FHSAs and practices about their indicative budgets. It is important that doctors and others who serve on the FHSAs known how that consultation will take place—if, indeed, there is be consultation. As I said this morning, there is a disparity between the White Paper, which says that there will be consultation, and the Bill, which seems to say that indicative budgets will be handed out by FHSAs to practices. It is a matter of importance to the groups mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) in the amendment. The number of special
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 650</span>
and heavy users will vary widely from practice to practice, and it is well known that the elderly—of whom we shall have more and more—use increasingly more meditation. I believe that the average number of prescriptions per person per year is about 5.3 for 16 to 64-year-olds, whereas the number grows to 24 per year for people over 75.<br><br>
It is clear that the number of people who use many medications during the year will be relevant, and each of the indicative budgets will have to be the subject of consultation between the appropriate authority and the practice to ascertain the number of heavy users. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Minister will now be able to answer my question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was ruled out of order this morning, Dame Janet, because of the concern that I expressed when speaking to the previous amendment, but I think that I can express that concern while speaking to amendment No. 455.1 am worried about the move towards the weighted capitation formula, and I would welcome an assurance from the Minister about it.<br><br>
As I understand the criteria, they relate to the age and sex of patients within the practice, and to issues such as temporary residence and the cost of dispensing. I wonder whether the criteria are realistic, however, and how adequately they will cover some of the special problems that arise in practices. How will the formula keep up with the change in patient-practice make-up, which occurs regularly and which I suspect will be actively encouraged by the Bill? I have in mind the active encouragement, referred to in earlier debates, of patients to move from one practice to another. I do not object to patients having that choice. They are entitled to be on the panel of the doctor of their choice, and move to another practice when they are unhappy, but I was worried by the Minister of Health's comment on Tuesday that if a patient is unhappy with the GP's performance, that patient is free to walk away.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I am always worried when Conservative Members talk about freedom, because some people are freer than others. What worries me especially is that freedom does not apply, because of specific problems—perhaps a handicap or a disability, or merely age—to people who may be on a particular panel. Let us consider the mobility of elderly or disabled people. By and large, they are tied to the practice that is the nearest to where they live. They do not have the freedom to pick and choose their GP, unless they have cars or easily available public transport. I am worried, too, about mothers and fathers with young children, and especially single parents, because of the practical problems that they have in using public transport. There are also the people who cannot afford to move to practices which may be more desirable, but which are some distance from where they live.<br><br>
I am worried about the consequence of encouraging people to move to different practices. Certainly the people who are mobile and advantaged can move to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 651</span>
different practices. They may move from an inner-city practice to one in an outlying area because they have the privilege of owning a car and can drive two or three miles away from where they live. Many other people, however, do not have that privilege. As a result, some practices may become full of disadvantaged members of the community—people who do not have the option to exercise the freedom of choice to walk away, as the Minister for Health put it.<br><br>
That has a clear bearing on the weighted capitation formula, which may not reflect the clear disadvantage that could build up in practices. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how that will be monitored. I hope that it will not be left to the FHSAs, because I know that existing FPCs—and from what I have heard about the new FHSAs, the same will probably be said of them—often have little knowledge of the poverty and difficulties faced by many patients in their areas. What will the Government do to ensure that GP practices are not affected by the formula when the changes take place, as they surely will?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a legitimate area of concern in the amendment and in the more general debate that has taken place since the publication of the White Paper—ill-informed as it may have been, and in spite of the assurances have been given by Ministers. The spectre at the feast is what I might call the spectre of the expensive patient—the individual who will cost the practice large sums of money, with the suggestion that that may act as a deterrent effect to his or her acceptance by the individual GP, or unbalance the provision for other patients in the practice. As a variant of that, there is the high cost of provision for particular groups of individuals and the way in which practices may change over time and provision becomes inadequate.<br><br>
I accept that Ministers have seriously addressed those issues, but having described the spectre of the expensive patient, I shall be most grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will lay the ghost of that expensive patient by explaining how the system will work so that no one will be deprived of the care to which he or she is entitled. By so doing, my hon. Friend will set our minds at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have this opportunity to confirm many of the points which were made this morning. We have said repeatedly that all patients will be able to receive the medication that they need, and where medication is clinically justified there will be no difficulty. Indeed, with a drug budget which has risen dramatically because of the many new treatments which are now available, it is right that any responsible Government should want resources to be used effectively and well. Many new drugs have been referred to during the debate, and with conditions which had previously been thought untreatable it is possible now to intervene and provide relief, whether it is cystic fibrosis or any other condition.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing Acton (Sir G. Young) referred to the contribution of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromary and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), who said that for patients who come from hospital the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 652</span>
crucial decision is who is clinically responsible, the hospital or the GP. The hon. Gentleman argued that the practitioner should undertake the prescribing.<br><br>
The indicative budget, which is essentially a monitoring tool, will be built up, starting with the existing prescribing rate and the costs of the existing practice. It will be analysed and discussed, and I can give my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) a clear assurance that there will be consultation with the local family health services authority about the way in which the size of the budget may move in future. The issues to be debated are the characteristics and demography of the practice, whether it has a GP with an interest in a particular specialty, whether a home may be opening up nearby with residents who have particular needs, and the arrival on the list of patients who need particularly costly drugs. All those factors are part and parcel of the decision.<br><br>
The family health services authority is to be enhanced and strengthened. It is a key part of our proposals to reform primary care, and there will be independent medical advisers at the FHSA who can enter into detailed discussions and debates about prescribing, the relative needs of different groups and the best way forward.<br><br>
We have accumulated a great deal of knowledge in recent years. We spoke this morning about the welcome PACT—prescribing analyses and cost— system and the regional drug information service at the University of Leeds and many other places, and there are a number of experts who can give advice and raise the standards of prescribing.<br><br>
I repeat that there is much agreement. We all need to be assured that patients will receive the drugs which they need, and that assurance has been given clearly and unequivocally. There is agreeement in the profession and the Government and even, I think, among Opposition Members, that drugs, which are such a vital part of modern health care, should be prescribed safely, effectively and well.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) expressed concern about practices in deprived areas and ensuring that their patients, who may already be disadvantaged and suffering from a variety of conditions, will receive the medical care which they need. We are committed to ensuring, through the indicative drug budget and through the new GP contract and our proposals for primary health care, that general practice will be enhanced and developed to provide precisely that service, which we all desire.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wakefield will recall that when discussing the GP, we made it clear that people over 75 would receive enhanced capitation. After the announcement of the review body's findings, I can tell him what the proposed relative figures are. The proposal is that for patients under 75 the capitation figure should be £12.40 a year, and that for patients over 75 it should be £31.45. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will regard that differential as concrete demonstration of our commitment to ensuring that the most needy will have rh: services which they need.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0701">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 653</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's answer, but I was concerned about the way in which the capitation formula may reflect and adjust to changes in the make-up of a practice, which could occur rapidly. Under the proposals in the Bill, I foresee changes occurring which may be to the detriment of some inner-city practices. Can the Minister assure me that those changes will be taken account of—not only changes in the age of the patients in a practice but wider changes could have a bearing on the nature of a practice's work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly can. If the hon. Gentleman examines the figures which we announced today, he will see the resources that are to be allocated to general practices in particular inner-city areas. The needs of an area are certainly part and parcel of building up the indicative drug budget. Anyone who has experience of an inner-city practice know that the prescribing figures do need careful examination, because it is often easier to give patients with many problems a prescription than to listen to those problems or offer them some other forms of intervention or help. We discussed that this morning when talking about some of the factors that lie behind variable prescribing rates. Precisely what is being concealed is one such factor.<br><br>
We all want there to be appropriate prescribing, and the capitation formula, where age is often strongly related to the amount of prescriptions required, is one tool that is available for the family health services authority to deploy when discussing the appropriate level of an indicative budget with the general practices in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful that the Minister has started to give us at least of some of the information which we need if we are properly to assess the system. Will the Minister be able to lay before us all data to which she referred before we discuss clause 18? I think that that would be the appropriate point at which to go into the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot do so now, but I can refer the hon. Gentleman to the review body's finding on doctors' and dentists' remuneration. The Department hope to issue a further working paper on the precise details when we have made a little more progress. Much work has been undertaken. The six FPCs have had access to more of the PACT data, and we shall at the earliest opportunity provide for general practice and family health services authorities to have further and more detailed information on this and on many of the other subjects that have been discussed in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister has not yet answered the question which I asked her this morning? I asked her what the Government's attitude was to under-treatment. Do they feel that it is a problem? If so, what mechanism do they have for dealing with it? If it is something other than the indicative drug budget and it is effective, why cannot they deal with over-prescribing by that mechanism rather than the indicative drug budget?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 654</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her intervention. There is confusion about the Government's techniques. Some of the techniques and objectives we share and others we do not, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find where there is common agreement and where there is not. What would have assisted us considerably, and certainly informed our discussions on clause 18, is a definitive statement from the Government on how the capitation system will work. I am disappointed and dismayed that we shall not have it when we discuss clause 18.1 would cheerfully forgo discussion of the matter now if we could have an assurance that when we reach clause 18, we shall have that information before us so that we can discuss the matter properly.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) reads the report of this morning's debate, she will see that we did not discuss under-prescribing.<br><br>
I made it clear that there are cases where the information will give rise to concern about under-prescribing, and we talked about it in the context of medical audit.<br><br>
It was argued that under-prescribing may sometimes require or lead to hospital treatment, which could have been prevented by more appropriate prescribing at an earlier stage by the GP. I made it clear that with the enhanced role of the family health services authority, the medical adviser, who will be particularly experienced in that area, will be able to ask practices whether there are areas where under-prescribing is as much of a problem as over-prescribing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a most helpful debate, for two reasons. First, we have had the welcome announcement of the large differential for the elderly, which I hope will receive a much broader audience than the members of the Committee because it deals head on with the argument hurled against us that there will be a disincentive to practices to take on elderly people as patients. The differential announced by my hon. Friend the Minister for Health deals with that squarely.<br><br>
Secondly, there has been a useful exposition of the methodology that will be used for building up the indicative budget. My hon. Friend explained that it will not be based on a formula and that regard will be had to the existing prescribing patterns of individual practices, which goes to the heart of the argument which I advanced.<br><br>
The only criticism that one could possibly make of my hon. Friend's response was that it was a much warmer moving of amendment No. 455 than my own, in that she explained that the Government will be doing everything that I suggested. That leads me to ask why my suggestions will not be written into the Bill. Perhaps my hon. Friend did not get on to that part in her speech, which explains why the amendment could not be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has just said, the Minister's figures deserve to be distributed to a

much wider audience than the one sitting here. Is there not a general feeling that much of the misinformation and disinformation put about when the White Paper was introduced should now be blown away?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister needs now to inform the public at large, especially doctors' practices, of the many clarifications which have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I saw a vigorous and collective nodding of heads when I was speaking, but my hon. Friend the Minister gave me no reason why I should withdraw the amendment. Perhaps there is none, in which case it could be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment cannot be accepted because it is unnecessary to stipulate the precise details in the Bill. With the great investment of energy and thought going into the study of prescribing, a number of different and crucial variables may become clear, so it is important for us to be flexible.<br><br>
The indicative budget will be a management tool and an important source of advice. It will be complementary to the many other mechanisms which exist for establishing effective prescribing. To follow the detail in the amendment would be unnecessary, and I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who could not accede to such a genuine request? I hope that my hon. Friend understands that before I asked leave to withdraw the amendment, I did need a reason for so doing. She has now supplied me with one, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under this morning's discipline, I thought it wise to raise two matters that I with to pursue in the debate on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill rather than during a debate on an amendment.<br><br>
My daughter, who is aged three, suffers from coeliac disease; my wife is the secretary of the Somerset Coeliac Society. The condition is a food allergy that at its worst can lead to starvation because the food ingested is not absorbed. The simple treatment is to avoid eating gluten in wheat, oats, rye or barley. Most patients are prescribed gluten-free bread and other products.<br><br>
It is expensive to produce gluten-free food commercially. If patients had to buy it on the open market, it would cost them a great deal of money. The Coeliac Society of the United Kingdom is anxious that gluten-free products should continue to be available on prescription. Advice from the Deptartment of Health recently suggested that it would not be available on prescription. I believe that the national Coeliac Society has been reassured by the Department that the products will continue to be available on prescription. Will my hon. Friend assure me that there is nothing in the clause that would militate against that facility? On average, one patient in every general practice suffers from the condition, which in some cases can be serious.<br><br>
I have no financial interest in the matter, but for the past 18 months I have been pursuing, by means of written questions, the problem of the importation— under the parallel licensing system—of counterfeit drugs, notably from Greece. I hope that the Minister will assure me that the clause will not inhibit the Department in imposing full sanctions and measures to prevent the importation of counterfeit drugs which might damage patients' confidence in the drug provision system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) said, it is sensible that we to return to certain issues in the clause-stand-part debate.<br><br>
In the new system, will there be cash limits at a higher level than that of the practice? I draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 7.16 of the White Paper, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Each year the provision made for FPS drug costs in the Parliamentary Estimates will be divided into separate firm budgets among the 14 health Regions, and RHAs will set drug budgets for each FPC on the basis of reasonable assumptions … FPCs will then set indicative budgets".</p></blockquote>
The word "firm" is used to describe drug budgets at regional level.<br><br>
At practice level, the word used is "indicative". The final part of paragraph 7.16 states that there are certain circumstances, during an influenza epidemic, for example, when amounts determined might need to be revised
<br><blockquote><p>"but otherwise RHAs and FPCs will be expected to work to the budget they have been given".</p></blockquote>
It is clear that at RHA and FPC—now FHSA—level, there is to be a "firm budget" which will provide an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 657</span>
amount within which they will have to work. That is an important aspect of the system. There cannot be a non-cash-limited service at practive level and a cash-limited service at regional or FHSA level. There is obviously tension between them. However, better news is on its way. The public expenditure White Paper does not discriminate between RHAs, FHSAs and GP practices. All the budgets are referred to an "indicative". The word "firm" is not used. It is important that we clarify that regions and FHSAs will have indicative budgets. The terminology "firm budgets" has been abandoned. If it is the case that there will be no cash limits at RHA and FHSA level, it is an important step forward. A system that seeks to impose cash limits at one level but not at another is not credible. We want the Minister to clarify the overcharging allocations to RHAs and FHSAs in relation to the practice-based budgets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like that hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) I, too, took note of Mr. McWilliam's advice to confine myself to the terms of some narrow amendments. I therefore have a number of comments to make in this debate.<br><br>
There has been much debate on the clause because of the anxieties created as a result of the White Paper's comment that downward pressure would be placed on expenditure on drugs, particularly in those practices with highest expenditure but without preventing people getting the medicines that they needed. In that way, prescribing could be improved, and wasteful expenditure avoided, for the benefit of the NHS. Thtat is a laudable aim. No one would wish— <i>[Interruption.]</i> Dame Janet, may I ask for your help?</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This one is so sensitive. He is an absolute treasure!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The rules of order must be obeyed by every member of the Committee. It is difficult to hear because this Committee Room is small and whispered conversations that pass unnoticed in Room 14 are therefore much more irritating. Will hon. Members please bear that in mind and observe common standards of courtesy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With his usual perspicacity, my hon. Fellow the Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim) said that I am on to a good thing if I am considered a treasure.<br><br>
The aim of the White Paper is laudable. No one in the medical profession would countenance over or inappropriate prescribing. Equally, there are many members of the profession who are worried about under-prescribing. We want doctors to prescribe correctly. Fears have been expressed that the objective of indicative budgets would be achieved by certain methods, in particular cash limiting the RHA and FHSA budgets. That would, in effect, cash limit the indicative budgets to practices. There are fears about the use of formularies, which I shall mention in a moment. There are fears, too, about generic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 658</span>
prescribing. Some hon. Members managed to slip comments on that subject past Mr. McWilliam, Dame Janet.<br><br>
The first of those fears has, to some extent, been alleviated by the commitments given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and by my hon. Friend the Minister of State in the House and outside. My hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) and I received answers to oral qestions on 7 November 1989. However, we do not know what would happen if the aggregation of indicative budgets were exceeded to the extent that the regional cash limit was exceeded. I should be grateful if the Minister would reply to that question.<br><br>
Many people are worried about formularies. It is felt that they delay the acceptance and use of new drugs by the medical profession. New drugs may mean substantial advances in treatment, and formularies, by their nature, involve bureaucracy and may delay by months, or even longer, the use of new drugs by doctors who are fearful of prescribing a drug that is not on the local formulary. I am grateful for the answer that the Minister gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) on 20 December 1989, in column 335 of Hansard. He made it clear that while formularies may perhaps be drawn up by FHSAs—I wish that we had stayed with FPCs, it would be so much simpler—that would be voluntary. That should be made clear to the profession.<br><br>
As I said in the context of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), the White Paper has caused great anxiety and misunderstanding in the many months since its publication. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will take the trouble to inform all doctors— they are notoriously bad readers of Hansard—about the many clarifications that the Committee has been given in the past few weeks, and especially today. In particular, I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for Health for what she said this morning— her praise of the industry, and her recognition of the efficiency of pharmaceutical tratment, in preference to other more invasive techniques, in delivering health care. It is also an economic way of delivering health care, as was demonstrated by the considerable reduction in gastric surgery brought about by the use of the H2 receptor blocking agents, Tagamet and Zantac. I know, from my past experience, of the tremendous clearance of the great mental hospitals by the use of psychotropic drugs, from the 1960s onwards, for schitzophrenia, and mention was made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), and by me on Second Reading, of the great avance that has followed the introduction of Eminase and the thrombolytic drugs. Those drugs will have a dramatic and beneficial effect on the prognosis, in a life-and-death situation, of heart attacks.<br><br>
So we hope that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and his colleagues will tell doctors that it is not the purpose of indicative budgets to offer the cheapest drugs; rather it is to seek and make available the best treatment in every case. We should remember that doctors in the United
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 659</span>
Kingdom are economic prescribers, as compared with doctors in other EC and developed countries. We should also remember that we have a very efficient pharmaceutical industry in this country. It is an industry that we should encourage, not scoff at. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchcliffe) made a few disparaging comments about over-enthusiastic drug salesmen. I am sure that he views them as people who—like myself, the publican, one or two bookmakers and secondhand car salesmen—are not nice to know. But the hon. Gentleman is wrong, of course, because there is a strict code of conduct, and his vision of all our GPs sitting drinking mint julep in the Caribbean at the expense of the pharmaceutical industry is something of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has gone over the top. I said that I thought that a market model was inappropriate in health care, and I maintain that some of the marketing activities of drug companies are not necessarily in the best interests of patients. I made it quite clear, and <i>Hansard</i> will confirm it, that only a small number of doctors are influenced by that means to use drugs that are not necessarily in the patients' best interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making clear what he meant the other day.<br><br>
After my right hon. and learned Friend has spoken this afternoon and clarified again the purpose of indicative drug budgets, I hope that he will communicate with the profession and, through it, its patients, so that the patients realise that there is nothing to be feared in indicative budgets, and that they will be what my hon. Friend the Minister for Health has called a useful tool, not a stick with which to beat the medical profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and to reply, first, to the important points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson). He referred to his daughter whom I have had the pleasure of meeting, and who, like many people has a serious dietary problem arising from a rare disease. There are problems both for the families who have to cope with the dietary requirements of such children and for the medical practitioners who have to assess to what extent they can prescribe as medicine under the NHS the parts of the diet necessary to keep the children in good health. It is a complicated area as my hon. Friend knows. There obviously has to be a borderline between what is food, which cannot be prescribed under the NHS, and what is prescribable as medicine because it is so closely related to a diet that is required for medicinal purposes. For many years we have relied on the advice on the advisory committee on borderline substances, which has tried to be as reasonable as possible because there is an underlying medical need and it is important that we help families with the costs.<br><br>
I can give my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton the assurance that he sought. Nothing in clause 17 will affect the rules about the availability of prescriptions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 660</span>
or of prescribable parts of the diet for children affected by coelic disease. Indeed, nothing in clause 17 will affect the availability under the NHS of drugs or appliances of any kind. The existing rules can no doubt be modified as the years go by to meet changing clinical needs, but that does not affect the availability of anything that can be prescribed now. All patients will continue to have prescribed to them all the drugs and appliances that they need.<br><br>
I share the anxieties of my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton about counterfeit drugs. I do not object to the importation of drugs into this country. I do not object to the importation of generic drugs. There are even advantages to the NHS in some parallel importing because, given the huge costs of drugs to the NHS, we have to be a prudent purchaser and to make sure that those who prescribe and dispense drugs have access to all that they require at reasonable cost. We must be rigorous about the safety of the drugs that are prescribed under the NHS and so our licensing requirements on those who import into this country must be as effective as the licensing requirements upon those who manufacture here.<br><br>
We must also protect the intellectual property of those who invest in research in this country and produce medicines under patent, which are then exploited by those who produce bogus products. In recent months instances of counterfeit drugs have been brought to our attention. We have also found them ourselves and been scrupulous in following them up. We are doing our utmost in collaboration with the industry to ensure that we do not become a market for counterfeit drugs. They are dangerous to patients because they have not been subject to licensing controls, and they damage the research base of our pharmaceutical industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. and learned Friend comment on the possible effects of 1992 and say whether it is under consideration by his Department?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is under consideration. In due course, but not in 1992, the completion of the single market in Europe will make great differences to the licensing, marketing and trade of pharmaceutical products. But these are early days. Although I am a great advocate of 1992 and was involved in it when I was at the Department of Trade and Industry, I do not think that we shall achieve a single market in pharmaceuticals by the early part of the next decade. We are involved in discussions on the licensing arrangements, which could be improved. We favour the single market so long as we look after the legitimate interests of the NHS as a purchaser and the British pharmaceutical industry as a research base for a successful industry in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the assurances given by my right hon. and learned Friend and I am sure that the pharmaceutical industry will read with great interest what he has said about the counterfeit problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) and by my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 661</span>
the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) which go to the root of the policy of the White Paper and clause 17.1 was surprised to hear the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central asks about the cash limits that would be applied to drugs in the NHS. I regret that I missed part of the debate but I wonder what on earth the Committee spent this morning discussing. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health has repeatedly explained the policy and given assurances, which my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham has welcomed.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
I am delighted that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central referred to the White Paper, "Working for Patients". I have used it repeatedly to convey to people what the Government are proposing. There is no point in reintroducing arguments that were disposed of long ago. Section 7.15 of the White Paper sets out our objective:
<br><blockquote><p>"The objective of this scheme is to place downward pressure on expenditure on drugs, particularly in those practices with the highest expenditure, but without in any way preventing people getting the medicines they need".</p></blockquote>
If anyone disagrees with that objective, I should be interested to hear his or her reasons. It must be in the NHS's interests to spend as much on drugs as is necessary to keep pace with medical progress and to give the best treatment to patients, but to spend no more than is necessary. That way, resources that can be spent on other things will not be wasted.<br><br>
I do not know whether the drugs bill will increase or decrease in future, nor by what rate. Its level will be detemined by the inventiveness of the pharmaceutical industry, by the proper price of the product—which is regulated by other means—and by the medical profession's decisions about pharmaceutical treatments vis a vis invasive treatments and about what is good prescribing practice for its patients. All that we are saying is that downward pressure should make sure that we spend what is justified and no more, so far as that is possible. That is what the structure is for.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central read out section 7.16 of the White Paper. He said that we had used unusual language there, which would have been true if it had been a Treasury document about public accounting. It referred to firm budgets at the regional level, drug budgets at the FPC level, and indicative budgets at the general practitioner level. We did not use the term "cash limits" because, as paragraph 7.16 explains, there are features of pharmaceutical expenditure that distinguish it from other things. In the course of a year, we shall have to take account of unpredictable variables, as the White Paper says. It gives the example, for the lay reader, of a flu epidemic. Other things could happen, such as the invention of a new drug which suddenly comes on to the market and which every GP wants to prescribe. One always has to take account of things that happen which legitimately alter our estimated expenditure.<br><br>
We cannot therefore talk about a fixed and inflexible cash limit. It is legitimate, however, to talk
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
about a budget to which all those responsible must address themselves. At the practitioner level, that budget can only be indicative. However, we must still give the practitioner a guide to show the level against which he is to be judged, and for which he may have to give an explanation at the end of the year. With FPCs, we are dealing with a bigger number, and they will be given a drug budget which will be what we expect the cost of their drugs to be for the year. The regions will have a firmer budget than that. They and the FPCs will be expected to manage those budgets. The regions will make sure that they chase up FPCs that are not overseeing their practitioners, and that FPCs chase up their high-expenditure practices to find out why that expenditure is out of line. At the end of each year, if people fail to hit those budgets, one is entitled to ask questions and to take account of the failures for future years. We shall ascertain whether the reasons for failing are legitimate, based on patients' needs, or whether they are based on some management laxity, for which the region, the family health services authority or the GP should be held accountable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the Secretary of State's argument extremely closely. What he said was interesting and illuminating. The last phrase of section 7.16 in the White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"but otherwise RHAs and FPCs will be expected to work to the budget they have been given."</p></blockquote>
The Minister outlined what the exceptional circumstances might be, and went a trifle further than section 7.16, which was helpful. However, will he confirm that, apart from those exceptions, the phrase from section 7.16 applies? If it does, will what has until now been a volume-driven provision—that is, pharmaceutical drugs through the NHS—become a provision limited by the budgets of RHAs and FPCs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentlemen read out from the White Paper, but I do not see the significance of his subsequent comments, on which he placed great weight but which do not follow from what he read. If a GP is given a budget, he should work to it so that if, at the end of a year in which things have worked out as predicted, he is not within the budget, he must be held to account—as he is at present through the ordinary managment accountability process. A region that has exceeded its budget may be asked why if it has done so if there has been no unforeseen eventuality relating to the clinical needs of patients.<br><br>
I shall not repeat further the argument of my hon. Friend the Minister for Health. I hope that we have laid to rest the bogies of our debate on clause 17. Formularies will be voluntary, through I think that many practices will adopt them. I know of few major hospitals that do not already have their own formulary, and those hospitals would not abandon them. GPs and family health services authorities can decide whether to have a formulary, and if they decide to have one, they can choose the one that they want, or devise their own. I have been to good general practice partnerships which have had their own formulary for years, and the partners follow it for prudent prescribing reasons.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 663</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) made a key point about communication with the doctors. Every aspect of the reforms have been bedevilled by sometimes ludicrous misunderstandings about the proposals. We sent a copy of the White Paper to doctors, but their understanding of it was coloured by the comments that were made about it at the time. We have sent them details of prescribing budgets, and we shall send out more guidance in the form of fresh working papers on indicative drug budgets. We must follow up mailshots with further information and explanation, and I hope that, as doctors discuss their own budgets, they will clearly understand before they come into effect in 1991.1 think that our objectives are accepted by everybody. The position of Opposition Members who oppose controls on unnecessary prescribing costs is indefensible though I gather that they tried to defend it in speeches this morning. Once the system is in place, nobody in his right mind will think that we have done anything other than introduce reasonable controls.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has not eased the situation, as he claims to have done. No Committee would defend GPS who prescribed drugs that patients did not want or should not have, nor would he oppose a reasonable system for examining over-prescription. I object, however, to the implied threat to GPs that is contained in the provisions. The Minister said that the present systems would not change. It is true that surgery and drug costs can now be examined by medical people. If the systems that exist already do not work, we should be told why, and how the Government propose to put them right. The Government should not threaten doctors by saying that if they do not put matters right their remuneration will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentlemen, because, although I invariably reply to the speech that follows mine, I shall not be able to do so today because I have a plane to catch, and my Whip says that I have a sporting chance of catching it. I shall read the hon. Gentlemen's speech, and I am sure that he will receive an adequate reply from my hon. Friend the Minister for Health.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish the Secretary of State a safe journey, and hope that he will not need a GP—or an ambulance. It has been said that during a party conference the Secretary of State fainted and four people ran across to tighten his tie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennet <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That fell flat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It did not at the time.<br><br>
Initially the budgets will be based on present prescription costs. Therefore, GPs' prescription costs will be met fully including those of GPs using bad prescription practices. After that initial period FPCs will give GPs a budget which they are not supposed to exceed. The Minister said that if GPs over-prescribe and exceed their budgets they will receive additional money. Therefore, what is the point of the clause?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
Breweries supply their landlords with the stock that they should sell and GPs will receive the cost of what they should prescribe, but those costs differ from area to area. Will the people who decide upon the weighting capitation be the people who live within the area, or will they be appointees of the Secretary of State? If they are to be the Secretary of State's appointees they will form a body that merely carries out his orders. The Government have said that age, sex, mobility, temporary residence and cross-family dispensing will be taken into account when FPCs consider their weighted capitations. But, they should also take account of housing provision, unemployment rates and any unusual stresses and strains in an area, as those factors also cause ill health. During the miners' strike I was anxious about the health of my constituents; but remarkably, their doctors informed me that surgeries had never been emptier. That was because women who had been taking vallium and other tranquillisers did not need to when their husbands were at home.<br><br>
Will FPCs consider investigations such as the one being carried out by Dr. Temple into accusations of over-prescription at the Gleneath practice? Dr. Temple's preliminary findings have shown that many peptic ulcers, cancers, and chest complaints were due to the advent of opencast mining with the Gleneath practice. I am interested in those findings, and have sought medical advice on them, as opencast mining is to begin in my consituency. Will money be made available to carry out such investigations? Will money be made available for such necessary increases in the number of prescriptions, or will practices be forced to exceed their budgets?</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State touched on some interesting matters. Although he is not here, I hope that the Minister for Health will be able to respond.<br><br>
The clause represents a lost opportunity. The Government should do more for generic substitution as a means of trying to contain drug budgets. When they introduced the limited list, the Government should then have considered generic substitution with a medical override. The prescribing GP would have had the opportunity to insist on the brand drug but—as in our hospitals—the standard procedure would have been the automatic use of a generic equivalent, had the GP not otherwise specified. I hope that further efforts will be made.<br><br>
The Secretary of State spoke about the discussions that have taken place about 1992. I understand that a draft directive on the pharmaceutical industry will be issued by the Commission later this year. The Secretary of State was well placed in the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that we had a key role in discussions on the interests of the United Kingdom pharmaceutical industry. He was also at the Department of Health as a junior Minister. Will the Minister assure us that DTI Ministers and Health Ministers are walking in step? Are they being positive in promoting what may emerge from the draft directive? What is the attitude of the Department of Health towards the directive?<br><br>

The former Minister for Health, who is now at the Home Office, told one of my hon. Friends:
<br><blockquote><p>"When the changes in Working for Patients have been implemented they will place a greater emphasis for prescribers on the price of drugs, and it may be sensible to modify the PPRS to reflect the fact".</p></blockquote>
Is that still the case, and what is happening about it?<br><br>
My next question is about parallel importing, referred to by the Secretary of State. The Department of Health said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are considering proposals … on how the regulations governing parallel imports could be amended to reduce risks to patients".</p></blockquote>
Is the Department still considering such proposals? What shape and form are they likely to take?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being in my place to move amendment No. 268. At that time, I was taking medication. I hope that my condition will not affect my performance in Committee.<br><br>
I have listened with great care to the Minister and other hon. Members referring to the indicative prescribing budgets. I have yet to understand why clause 17 was included in the Bill. It seems that there are no new sanctions, or other reasons for medical practitioners to worry about the clause. The Minister should credit us with believing that there must be another reason for the clause, beyond what we have already been told. Depsite the assurances, the clear intention is that the Minister is trying to reduce the drug budget. Unless the medical profession heeds the Government's warnings, the sanctions that are implicit in the clause will be imposed.<br><br>
I want to ask the Minister two questions. I understand that the FPCs—FHSAs, as they will be called—will have a budget, and that in England there will be a method of appeal to the RHA for further funding, and subsequently, I assume, to the Secretary of State. As there are no RHAs in Wales, what will happen when FPCs' budgets are exceeded?<br><br>
I understand that the Minister has responded to the thrust of the amendment that I would have argued for, had I been present, but may I push the hon. Lady a little further? Surely the fact that the budget is to be based on previous prescribing patterns should take account of the fact that part of that prescribing represents the continuation of treatment in hospital? The budget for the following year should take account of any treatment that is continued by the GP on the recommendation of the hospital consultant. I understand that the Minister said that it would depend on the GP's clinical judgment, but will she tell me why the amendment that I tabled could not have been embodied in the Bill? Is it something about which, on reflection, she will think again?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will not be tempted to impose compulsory generic prescriptions, as the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) suggested. I admit that it is one way to reduce expenditure on pharmaceuticals, but it very much restricts the independence of GPs, and the solution
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
that my hon. Friend has produced—that of indicative drug budgets—is much better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I was advocating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that, because the Government's proposal to have indicative budgets is a better and more effective way of reducing waste, and it is also better than having a limited or negative list. Generic and limited lists may address the problem of wasteful expenditure on expensive branded pharmaceuticals, but they do nothing about excessive prescription or the prescription of placebos.<br><br>
We were given encouraging assurances by the Government in our debates on amendments to the clause, and I am sure that the medical profesion will now appreciate, if it did not before, that indicative budgets will not mean cash limits, and that they are simply a management tool. I can think of no better way of monitoring the prescription behaviour of the British medical profession, because it will enable the Government to take any further measures that may be needed to curb the spending of excessive amounts.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said this morning, in another context, that he sometimes finds it difficult to understand what I say. I hope that he will understand me when I agree with him.<br><br>
I shall be interested in the Minister's comments on the unified registration procedure in the European Community. Though it is not directly germane to the Bill, we should understand the implications of the clause to the pharmaceutical industry, which is important to this country. If there were one standarised registration procedure throughout the Community it would save the drug companies substantial resources. At present, they have to go through complicated procedures in different markets, and the British pharmaceutical industry—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going wide of the clause. Will he explain why his remarks are germane to the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Dame Janet. I want indicative budgets to have an impact on the medical profession and on the economics of the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry. The British pharmaceutical industry has been most successful and innovative in recent years. It should be closer to the hearts of hon. Members to discover how the Government feel as its major customer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not in order for the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim) to move in front of the Chairman when an hon. Member is speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) mentioned the significance of generic prescribing. Generic prescribing has increased from about 29 per cent, to about 40 per cent. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State said that he wanted it to be around 50 per cent, in the foreseeable future. When
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0708">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 667</span>
general practices come close to their indicative budget, they will discuss ways in which to curb costs with the adviser from the FHSA. Generic prescribing is one such way, another is having their own practice formulary. There are a number of ways in which prescribing could be more effective and better value for money while maintaining a high standard of patient care.<br><br>
I shall not speak at length about the developments in 1992. It is not material to the clause, except in so far as work is underway on the directive and there will be consultations. I hope to hear from hon. Members with a direct interest in the subject on a more suitable occasion.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to parallel imports. What matters with pharmaceuticals is quality, efficacy, and safety. We also want good value for the NHS.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) mentioned his amendments. I spent some time on the issues raised by them because they are important. There is, however, a lack of clarity; the key issue is who has clinical responsibility. It would be enormously bureaucratic to distinguish from the indicative drug budget precisely those prescriptions attributable to a particular hospital. It is important that more work is done on clinical responsibility.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay) asked why the measure is necessary. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is necessary. We have made good headway. The limited list made an important contribution: as a result, £75 million has been diverted to other important areas of primary health care. The PACT scheme has made a major contribution to our understanding. We are accumulating information about prescribing all the time.<br><br>
6.00 pm<br><br>
Rather than simply building on the advice, I urge hon. Members to consult the work of Professor Conrad Harris, who has studied this at great length. He is based in the department of general practice at Leeds university, and he makes the point that if one gives advice to a general practice about its prescribing, it may change in the short term but after a year or two the natural reaction is to go back to the traditional ways of prescribing. An indicative drug buget is a way to provide a target for the practice and a tool by which it can measure its prescribing.<br><br>
We have said at length that the precise nature of the budget is a matter for discussion in all the cases that have been mentioned. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn gave the example of a budget being constructed on the basis of a previous pattern and a patient who, having been the responsibility of a hospital practitioner then returned to the practice. Those are precisely the sorts of case that the budget is intended to take into account. The key role of the FHSA and the medical adviser at that level working with local general practitioners will be a force for good and a useful tool which will ensure that we have effective, high quality prescribing. Above all, there are clear and absolute assurances that no patients will be denied
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 668</span>
treatment that they need when there is a good clinical need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall vote against the clause, and we shall carry on our campaign, both on Report and outside the House, against cash limiting of drugs budgets. The Minister of State and the Secretary of State have given assurances to this Committee and, I believe, in the form of a press statement after this morning's sitting that drugs budgets will not be cash limited. The Minister's assurances and those of the Secretary of State match our amendments. If those assurances meant anything, the Government should accept our amendments. We cannot take these assurances to have any meaning that any patient can rely on because the Government will not accept the amendments that would put those guarantees and safeguards into the Bill.<br><br>
The indicative drugs budget is an indiscriminate weapon that may deal with over-prescribers but will also hit at patients needing drugs. It is a cost containment measure which will be imposed at the expense of patients needing treatment, and we shall vote against it.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
fortunate that our discussions on the principle of these amendments had already been foreshadowed in earlier debates on England and Wales. It is important to discuss the Scottish dimension and the aspects of the amendments that apply to Scotland. Towards the end of the previous debates we got some interesting information about capitation system details. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has anything to say about that during our discussions but I am sure that general practitioners in Scotland who, unlike those doctors whom the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) knows, follow our proceedings with keen interest would be anxious to hear his comments.<br><br>
The amendments concern indicative prescribing budgets. None of the assurances given today, including the contribution by the Secretary of State for Health, will have reassured GPs in Scotland or, more importantly as they would feel, their patients that the Government do not have a system of cash limits in mind. According to the Government they have no such idea in mind and these dreadful GPs and their patients simply misunderstand them. Despite the millions of pounds that the Government have spent on promoting their policies, those misunderstandings persist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will realise that much of the misunderstanding arose from the meaning of the word "budget". That is probably because so few Opposition Members wish to understand that. Doctors certainly did not understand it. It is standard practice in all businesses to operate to budgets. They could have taken guidance from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who announces a Budget every year. That does not mean that it is cast in stone and cannot be changed. That is why we have an Autumn Statement and various other changes. Budgets are for guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it to the hon. Gentleman to lecture the doctors in his constituency. He would not have much success lecturing in my constituency. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) and I recently had a meeting with GPs at the Monklands district hospital. Although they had studied the Government's proposals in great detail, it was one of the angriest meetings I have ever faced and I would not presume to lecture them on how they should conduct their practices. They reminded us that the Government were elected on a policy of non-interference, and if ever a Government have interfered, and with principles of accountancy rather than of medicine in mind, this Government have.<br><br>
These are modest amendments. If the Government are so keen to invite the Committee, the GPs and the public to accept their assurances, why cannot they accept amendment No. 554? I suspect that most hon. Members are anxious to get home to their constituences. We could finish the debate this minute if the Minister would accept the amendment, but it seems that we have not persuaded him to write his assurances into the Bill in order to eliminate any ambiguity.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should look closely at amendment No. 554, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"there will be no sanctions, financial or otherwise".</p></blockquote>
What does he mean by sanctions? I have the same problem with that term as he does with budgets. I simply do not know what he means by sanctions. In my view, if doctors in a practice were found to be prescribing over a level that was judged acceptable by their peers, they should be advised about it. Would that be considered a sanction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is in no doubt about what sanctions mean. Nor are GPs, who had to endure threats—not least from the Secretary of State—and were fully aware that sanctions might even impinge upon their own salaries. If they exceeded their budgets, they would have had to find cash from elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way, but I hope that the Minister and the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will pay the same attention to the clock as I have. We are all anxious to do justice to Scotland, but we seem to have been given the tail end of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and entirely share his concern to ensure that the Scottish aspects of the Bill are properly debated. He asked for an assurance about the amendment so that he could sit down and we could all go home, but which amendment was he talking about? If he means amendment No. 554, surely he can see that it is too open-ended. It would require a doctor to be provided with whatever resources he wanted, irrespective of circumstances or justification. Is he really arguing for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I specifically referred to amendment No. 554. The Minister has spoken in the naive style which he occasionally adopts but which, I have to say, does not always sound convincing in Scotland. If the Government mean what they have been saying today, they should have not the slightest difficulty in accepting amendment No. 554. They say that they do not believe in cash limits, and want GPs to accept that.<br><br>
I have great difficulty in accepting the Government's assurances, especially as they continue to resist our modest amendments. I speak from experience. The word ''indicative" is one that hon. Gentlemen can understand, and it haunts an ex-president of the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities such as myself. I recall going to St. Andrew's House, Edinburgh in that capacity to meet a charming, persuasive, thoughtful Minister—the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). He was commending to local authorities guidelines on local government expenditure that would be "indicative" rather than "definitive". Far from being merely indicative, those guidelines were inflicted like a straitjacket, on Scottish local authorities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 671</span>
When he was Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Ayr pursued cash limits and rate capping—a practice continued by his successor. The Government intend clearly to have the same rigid control over GP budgets that they wanted to have over local authority budgeting.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
We have been told that the Bill is an enabling measure and the powers in clause 31 would be a matter for interpretation by the Secretary of State. The Committee is entitled to question that. In a letter sent during the Conservative party conference to the chairman of the Council of the British Medical Association, the Secretary of State for Health gave many assurances about budgeting and cash limits and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Those points will of course be carried through into our legislative proposals to Parliament."</p></blockquote>
There is nothing in clause 31 to suggest that that promise has been honoured for Scotland. I await with interest the Minister's response to that. He must accept that pledges by the Secretary of State for Health and Scottish Office Ministers are not worth the paper that they are written on. The British, and especially the Scottish, public do not trust the Government's declarations on health matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give one reason among many— the Government have made so many promises that they have not honoured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like what?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the Prime Minister's declaration in 1979 that she would not increase prescription charges. They were then 20p, but are now £2.80. The Government made promises to the nurses that they did not honour, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's allegations are astonishing. His party cut nurses' pay. In my constituency, nurses are well aware of how much better off they are financially under this Government—over 40 per cent. better off in real terms, over and above the rate of inflation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know which party nurses would prefer to have in office. I am sorry that the Secretary of State is not present to listen to my anecdotal evidence. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) for returning to this theme, but I promise that it is for the last time.<br><br>
On Monday I attended a Scottish Trades Union Congress on the proposals in the little civic centre theatre in Motherwell. As there were so many attacks by nurses and their representatives on a certain Mr. Clarke, I felt it necessary to go to the rostrum and point out that they were not referring to me. I said that if it would help, I might consider changing my name by deed poll, perhaps to Forsyth. That provoked boos and hisses. I tell that story simply to show the Secretary of State that in the nursing profession in Scotland someone is even more unpopular than he is.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 672</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Were those representatives from the Royal College of Nursing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman could not attend the conference. One of the first speakers was Miss Duncan from the Royal College of Nursing. I am sure that her views influenced the reaction of the delegates to the very mention of the Under-Secretary's name, but I shall not dwell on private agony.<br><br>
The amendments are about the worries of GPs and arise from a debate that took place at national level and an exchange of letters between the Secretary of State for Health and the BMA. The Secretary of State said that although budgets would be firm, they would not operate as cash limits. What is meant by that? What is the difference between being firm and cash limits? Local authorities will be interested in the reply to that question. In Scotland, responsibility for such matters will be transferred from the health board to the practice. Each practice will be responsible for fixing a budget for the cost of drugs
<br><blockquote><p>"which, in the opinion of the Board it is reasonable to expect will be supplied in that year pursuant to orders given by or on behalf of the members of that practice."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 554, which so worried the Under-Secretary, provides that there shall not be sanctions— financial or otherwise. Throughout the afternoon we have been told that there will be no sanctions. If that is true for England and Wales, why have we not been given similar assurances for Scotland? Surely the easiest way to do that would be for the Minister to accept the amendment. The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) eloquently and rightly pointed out this morning that it is a question of cost as against medical needs. Will the Minister deal with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly deal with it when I reply. Is the hon. Gentleman against the current system of sanctions that are applied where a GP has overprescribed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to speak about that and I shall do so in due course. If the Minister wishes to intervene at that point I shall be happy to give way.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman for Ross, Cromarty and Skye dealt with the important issue of medical need. The Government appear to have dug themselves into a hole which they cannot get out of. They have not persuaded the public that they are committed to medical need as a priority. The Bill does not introduce penalties for GPs, but the White Paper says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will also seek powers to enable FPCs to impose financial penalties on GPs who persistently refuse to curb excessive prescribing."</p></blockquote>
I come back to the Minister's intervention. Regulations already exist, as the Minister reminded us. The hon. Member for Tayside, North asked me about the threat of sanctions; they are clearly stated in the White Paper. If our amendment is not accepted, the Secretary of State will be given powers to introduce regulations and impose sanctions. GPs have no doubt that the Government will not hesitate to use these sanctions and if the clause is not amended, the sanctions will be subjective.<br><br>

The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) referred to the Government's policies for care in the community, and I was delighted that he did. It is not possible to impose dogma throughout the United Kingdom and to be doctrinaire even about the different regions of Scotland. GPs have different views about community care, among other matters. Some are more progressive than others, possibly in response to the telling representations that we have received from such organisations as the Schizophrenia Fellowship some doctors might take the view that the greater use of drugs makes it possible for people to be cared for in the community for longer. That would be an alternative to sending such people to hospital and accepting the "revolving door" syndrome—the process by which people who suffer from schizophrenia move from one hospital to another and then back to the first. Some doctors might feel that with the agreement of the patient and perhaps the patient's advocate drugs would be more appropriate than hospitalisation. Under the clause, unamended, doctors could be penalised for the very approach to community care that the hon. Member for Gillingham so happily commended to the Committee.<br><br>
The amendments refer to Scotland and within Scotland there are differences in climate. I do not believe that the Minister with responsibility for health in Scotland can ignore the figures that show regional variations in the number of cold-related deaths in winter. In England and Wales the figures for February 1989 show that there were 23 per cent. more winter than spring and summer deaths and in Scotland there were 19 per cent. more. The difference in the United States was 8 per cent. and in Sweden and Canada, 6 per cent.<br><br>
GPs must respond to the variations that they find in their practices. In my constituency there was a serious outbreak of meningitis last year. I am sorry to relate that my own GP died as a result of contracting the disease. That experience does not disappear from our minds after one, two or three years. Patients are interested in preventive medicine for their own cases and local GPs have to respond to their anxieties. Nothing in the Government's declaration has so far given me the impression that preventive medicine is their aim.<br><br>
I am happy to give way to the Minister, but I can reassure the Committee that I shall be drawing my remarks to a close shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspected that the hon. Gentleman might be drawing his remarks to a conclusion, though he still has not answered my question: is he opposed to the existing arrangements to deal with over-prescribing by general practitioners?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If general practitioners are happy to go along with the present system, I would be reluctant to change it. I would listen to their views and to those of my constituents. Ours is the party that listens.<br><br>
I shall ask the Minister a question that I hope he will respond to in his speech. What will he, as a Minister, do if he receives evidence of under-funding and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 674</span>
under-prescribing? That, too, is a great problem and one that no Conservative Member has faced up to.<br><br>
I am sorry that more time is not available, but I conclude by saying that both the Minister and the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) are fully aware that the Government's assurances on indicative budgets are unacceptable to Scottish GPs and to the Scottish people. The Minister knows the need to emphasise health education and preventive medicine in Scotland. Properly introduced, those could lead to some GPs spending less, not more. GPs should not be penalised for that approach.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
The unamended clause gives power to accountants and administrators over general practitioners and patients. That is our objection to the Bill and the clause, and why public opinion is with us. The Minister should accept the amendments, which would make Government policy more reasonable on a matter that has caused great difficulties for the medical profession in Scotland and, more importantly, for their patients.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One has to comment on what the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said. I am fascinated to hear that he thinks that Scottish doctors are following our proceedings with great care. I hope that they are, because that would dispel much of the myth and misinformation that has been spread by him and his hon. Friends.<br><br>
I, like most Scots, trust the vast majority of Scotland's GPs. They do a good job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not trust the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The GPs in my constituency trust me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is a disappointment that the Committee is not being televised? If it were Scottish doctors could have seen the Minister's face when the hon. Gentleman commented on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that I believe that the majority of Scots trust the vast majority of Scotland's GPs. That trust is at risk today. I remember vividly—the hon. Member for Monklands, West is not so old as me, but I am sure that he remembers too—a time when the men of the cloth, the pillars of the Kirk were trusted and believed. That is sadly no longer true. As a regular churchgoer, I find that depressing. The Church has become so politicised that it is no longer believed. I fear that if doctors—and I have said this to doctors on Tayside—play politics and put out misinformation, the trust that exists today will be at risk. I am worried that doctors should have been used in that way.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Monklands, West, gave an assurance that Scottish doctors were reading our proceedings—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 675</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a minute. The hon. Gentleman is always courteous and I always give way to him. I find it rich that the hon. Gentleman should tell us that he is worried that Scotland is being treated differently from England on the day that his party announces a Scottish tax proposal different from any in England. That is an astonishing claim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only the hon. Gentleman could produce an attack on the Scottish Kirk and clergy, followed immediately by one on doctors. I put to him, ever so gently, that it could be that their views are right and the Government's policies are wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that if one gives out information which the public later discovers to be misinformation, the trust which existed, especially in the Church, will disappear. Many men of the cloth no longer believe the utterances that they make.<br><br>
Budgets are not cast in stone. Yet the hon. Member for Monklands, West seems conveniently to have forgotten that recently, and on more than one occasion the NHS budget had to be revised in the middle of a year to take account of the substantial increases awarded to nurses. We must take account of such factors when discussing budgets. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends misuse the English language and forget that budgets are commonplace. That is why people do not believe them. Every business man and probably every housewife knows that a budget has a cash limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the example of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and be extremely brief.<br><br>
I have one or two questions about the Scottish context. I wish to ask the Minister to discover how the scheme will operate in Scotland under the health board structure proposed in clause 31. We are moving towards a Scottish prescribing analysis, which seems to be a sensible move. It involves the profession and the Government and it could prove a good way of ensuring effective, safe and economic prescribing. I believe that GPs in Scotland will recognise it as being a useful tool for auditing their prescribing behaviour.<br><br>
If the Scottish prescribing analysis were linked to an enhanced basis for the peer group review system in the current framework, the aims of the Government and the profession, on which there have been strong differences of opinion, could be agreed without many of the provisions of the clause being necessary. That is where I run into difficulties with the Minister, because it would be better to go down that rather more consensual track than to adopt the sledgehammer which the hon. Member for Tayside, North wielded. On this occasion, he seemed to be wielding it more against the kirk than GPs' surgeries. For that, the GPs will breathe a sigh of relief, although what the Moderator will make of it I do not know. I shall read the letters column of <i>The Scotsman</i> with interest in the next week or so.<br><br>
In support of the desirability of reaching that degree of agreement about the Scottish prescribing analysis, I quote the words of the BMA in Scotland from a summary of its views on the clause. It states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 676</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"we find the mechanism suggested in the Working Paper on indicative budgets unnecessary. Indeed the investment in time and money required to implement the proposals suggested in Paragraph 14 of Appendix 2 will divert time and other resources from clinical to administrative activities when this appears to be contrary to the aims of the White Paper."</p></blockquote>
That is a legitimate view, so I cannot understand why the Minister has to press ahead when greater emphasis on self auditing and peer group review might achieve much of what is proposed in the clause.<br><br>
With regard to the Scottish context of cost benefit analysis of drugs indicative budgets, to what extent will the Minister and the Scottish Home and Health Department take account of the fact that, as I said in another context, the correct prescription of a drug can often do away with the need for long-term institutional care or surgery?<br><br>
In those cases there is a financial and practical saving to the Health Service due to the use of the drug, which might not show up under an accountant's examination of a drug budget. To what extent will the mechanisms in Scotland take account of that and ensure an accurate cost-benefit analysis.<br><br>
My final point reflects issues that have arisen time and again in the Scottish parts of the debate. The part of Scotland that the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) represents is demographically different from the parts that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and I represent. The age profile is changing across the land; it is a welcome sign that people are living longer and more healthily. We have a higher proportion of aged people in areas such as our own, and that will have a knock-on effect on drugs expenditure. Therefore, will the Minister assure us that, in the parts of the country with a high proportion of elderly people where some drugs might be more essential and costs greater than elsewhere, indicative budgets will allow for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made an important point about the differences between constituencies. Our constituencies have many visitors during the skiing seasons. Mine also has an enormous influx of casual workers for picking berries and tatties. Those things all have an impact on GPs, community hospitals, and—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we seem to have some subcommittees at work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The examples that the hon. Gentleman gives in extending my argument are excellent. I think that the sub-committees are working on a translation of "tatties". I often think that the less the English know about what goes on in Scotland and the more we speak in our dialects, the better.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's point about incoming workers and tourism is important. In parts of Scotland that will have to be borne in mind. I seek an assurance—although if we divide I shall vote against the clause—that if the clause stands there will be sufficient sensitivity and flexibility at the Scottish Home and Health Department to ensure that those legitimate considerations are taken into account.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful discussion. Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Monklands, West seems to have a false impression of the clause. He seems to be determined to establish that there is cash-limiting at work, and that if there were not, there would be no reason for the Government not to accept amendment No. 554. But that amendment would ensure that a GP, regardless of how much he was over-prescribing, could do so without sanctions. I pressed the hon. Gentleman on several occasions to tell the Committee whether he supported the present system, whereby GP's who over-prescribe can be identified by the area medical committee and action can be taken. At first the hon. Gentleman did not answer the question. Then he said that if doctors were happy with it, he supported it. The hon. Gentleman ought to think about the patients.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister reads <i>Hansard,</i> he will see that I referred to patients as well at that point. If the Minister is saying that he accepts the spirit of the amendment, but not the detail, I again offer him the prospect of agreement: we shall accommodate him on Report by allowing him to reintroduce principle, but with the technical drafting that appeals to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no technical deficiency in the amendment, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"but there will be no sanctions…applied against a practice which exceeds its indicative drug budget." That is irrespective of the reasons for overspending.</p></blockquote>
6.45 pm<br><br>
A GP who over-prescribes can be brought before the area medical committee and action can be taken against him, under existing regulations, if there is no good reason for his over-spending. The Bill will not add to the sanctions that can be applied against GPs for over-prescribing. An Opposition Front-Bench spokesman is now proposing to drive a coach and horses through the current system with his amendment. The amendment would enable any GP, however irresponsible, to be allowed to over-prescribe without any sanction at all. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will say that that is not the Labour party's position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I should do is to invite the Minister to interpret the Labour party's position; nor would I expect many people to accept the invitation. The Minister and I clearly mean different things by the word "sanctions". I do not believe that it is unreasonable in a democratic society to consult doctors and patients on the basis of existing regulations. Why does the Minister find that offensive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forysth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately the hon. Gentleman does not know what the present position is. The sanctions that can be applied if a GP—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the word "sanctions".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell me what word he prefers? "Sanctions" is the word used in his amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 678</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the present regulations do not include the word "sanctions". If I am wrong, will the Minister show me and the Committee where it is to be found?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now arguing about the words. His amendment reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"but there will be no sanctions … applied against a practice which exceeds its indicative drug budget."</p></blockquote>
As I have said, that is irrespective of the reasons for overspending.<br><br>
At the moment, sanctions are applied against a GP who over-prescribes. If he is held to have done so, there can be withholding from that GP, and he may have to pay a large sum from his own income, not out of his practice. Sanctions are therefore available. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would allow GPs to be entirely irresponsible in their prescribing without sanctions being applied. I suspect that on reflection the hon. Gentleman will want to withdraw from his position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, by his silence, has confirmed that the word "sanctions" does not appear in the current regulations. I do not understand how he can therefore suggest that I am attempting to change them. If that word so offends the Minister, for a third time I offer him the opportunity to accept the principle but to produce better wording on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stop nit-picking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) tells me to stop nit-picking. The hon. Gentleman must be aware that there are penalties within the existing regulations. He seems to object to the word "sanctions" but not to the word "penalties". If he thinks that legislation consists of finding words that mean the same, he would be happier in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera than in Committee. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Labour party's view is that GPs who over-prescribe and exceed their indicative budgets should face penalties? If he is, I welcome it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is to be any change in the existing regulations—although I do not see any clamour for it; it is the Minister who is pressing for it, not me—I am prepared to enter into discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is remarkable. The hon. Gentleman is not willing to say that the Labour party is opposed to penalties for general practitioners who over-prescribe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is nit-picking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to a matter of fundamental importance. We believe that general practitioners should be subject to a pay review by their colleagues. When they are found to be over-prescribing, they should be brought to account. The clause merely introduces a system, whereby we help practitioners by forewarning them of the expenditure that they should meet in respect of their prescribing. The existing system of penalties—which the hon. Gentleman cannot now bring himself to condemn— will still apply.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0714">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 679</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that we object to the cash limiting of indicative drug budgets? I am the first to admit that the way in which the amendment is drafted is not one of the wonders of the world, but it makes it clear that we are against cash limiting. If the Minister's argument is that our amendment is defective because it would wipe out other provisions with which we agree, we shall be happy to redraft it if he will accept it on Report. Why does he not deal with the principle, instead of nitpicking about the technicalities? It is refreshing that he understands the technicalities, which is a change from the ministerial responses that we have received so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is extremely muddled. The hon. Member for Monklands, West argued, not 10 minutes ago, that I should accept the amendment, so that we could all catch our respective trains home —a matter of which I am well aware. The hon. Lady said that she was worried about cash limiting, but the clause does not mention cash limiting. It provides for indicative budgets. General practitioners will be able to exceed indicative budgets. There will be no reduction in the drugs available as a result of their exceeding the budgets. If they over-prescribe, they will be subject to pay review as they are now. If they are held to have over-prescribed, the same sanctions will apply—the same sanctions which the hon. Member for Monklands, West cannot bring himself to condemn. Does the hon. Lady support the existing system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should rather give way to the hon. Member for Peckham, so that we can hear from the Opposition Front Bench what exactly is the Labour party's position. Does it support the current system in respect of over-prescribing by general practitioners and the sanctions that will be applied? The hon. Lady will not explain the Labour party's view. That is because she recognises that the amendments—were I to accept them—would drive a coach and horses through the existing system, and would enable general practitioners to over-prescribe at will.<br><br>
We have ascertained from this revealing debate that the Opposition do not understand that indicative budgets are meant to assist GPs. I give all credit to the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) for pointing that out. I thank him for his remarks about the Scottish prescribing analysis, which is a step forward. There is agreement between the Government and GPs on many respects. The hon. Gentleman asked why we need such legislation. We need it to apply sanctions against GPs who over-prescribed against the agreed figures.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye made an extraordinary point when he asked what would happen if savings on a specific drug could avoid operations or a patient being sent to hospital. Our proposals are not about saving money. They are about providing the best patient care. I assume that, in deciding whether to prescribe drugs or treatment in hospital, GPs will consider patients' interests, and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 680</span>
budget will reflect the profile and interests of patients. Therefore, I hope, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have discovered, in the years that the hon. Member for Stirling and I have been in the House together, that the weaker his argument the more obstreperous he becomes, and we have just had a demonstration of that. Nothing could have been more reasonable that our case for the amendment, and nothing could have been more unreasonable than his reply. We could have had a genuine consensus if he had accepted three proposals, although consensus is not something that we associate with him. He had an opportunity to redeem himself, but he threw it away. Therefore, I ask the Committee to divide on the amendent.</span></p>
