</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned this morning I was beginning to address the points raised on amendment No. 189 by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and other hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned the Minister implied that the statement by the National Audit Office that patients were reluctant to travel could not be substantiated. Before he moves on, will he say what he means? I am sure that the Minister understands the status of the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General-[Interruption].</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am finding it difficult to hear the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reports are agreed with the Department. The documents are approved by the accounting officer of the Department before they are put to the Public Accounts Committee. Therefore, departmental officials have approved the statement that patients are reluctant to travel, yet the Minister suggested that that was not the case. Will he clarify his position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do that. I referred to the MORI poll conducted for the National Consumer Council, which asked patients whether under certain conditions they would be prepared to travel outside their district for elective surgery. About 90 per cent.—and I quoted the precise percentage—were prepared to travel for quicker and better surgery; there were two separate questions. An overwhelming number of patients were prepared to travel. I did not challenge the statement of the National Audit Office which is rather different, as the hon. Gentleman will find on reflection. Indeed I read that report. It is clear and comprehensive and a vindication of the value of our proposals on contracting. I stress that my references were to the MORI poll. I should be happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with the reference because when he discusses the subject in the Public Accounts Committee he may find the statistics helpful. I shall write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move on to deal with the main thrust of the comments made by the hon. Member for Livingston on amendment No. 189.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is entitled to use his own
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
definition of core services, but the truth is that there is a misunderstanding, not between the hon. Gentleman and myself—he has spent much time researching the issues—but within the Committee as to what the Government mean by the term "core services." I am happy to set the record straight. The hon. Gentleman knows that I believe in being frank to the point sometimes of embarrassing myself but I do not believe that the original way in which we presented our proposals a year ago was as clear as we would have wished. "Core services" relate only to NHS trusts. In the White Paper, the word "core" has no meaning outside such trusts. The hon. Member for Livingston used the word broadly. We mean the services that must be provided by NHS trusts, because local access is needed. Therefore, it is a restriction on the ability of NHS trust hospitals to change, vary or reduce the services offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) that there is anxiety about the withdrawal of services, in both trust and directly-funded NHS hospitals as a result of the contract system, which would put patients at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall amplify the six key principals which where set out in the White Paper and which relate to the argument of the hon. Member for Livingston on the provision of local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) that the National Health Service Act 1977 places upon the Secretary of State the obligation to provide a comprehensive range of health services. The Secretary of State has delegated that to DHAs using regulations under section 13 of that Act. We shall lay similar regulations under the negative resolution procedure after the Bill's enactment, setting out further duties on DHAs to provide a comprehensive range of services. It was a Labour Government who introduced the 1977 Act, and included the ability to make regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, under our proposals the DHAs will be obliged to serve all those who live within their catchment area. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr Jones) rightly said that the 1977 Act referred to services rather than the residents within a district. We intend to change that obligation so that it relates to all residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, some services undeniably need local access for residents in the authorities' catchment areas. But we do not define local access as access within a DHA's boundary, as the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) rightly said. In some places such as in London's spatially small districts local access can be discharged by contiguous authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Islington and Bloomsbury, patients would have to travel only a few miles. Opposition Members rightly said that the maternity service needs to be provided locally for obvious reasons. However some services, such as heart and liver transplants, do not require local access as provision clearly may be a considerable distance away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, accident and emergency services must be available to all. including foreigners. I shall say later how we intend to enshrine that obligation in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
Fifthly, NHS trusts that are also hospitals may have to be limited in their ability to eliminate or reduce the provision of certain services if guaranteed local access is required. We shall discuss the matter more fully on later clauses, but the Bill, and regulations following it, will give the Secretary of State ultimate power to determine the minimum range of core services that must be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixthly, decisions about services that require local access and the initial definition of core services in and for a district health authority must be made by the DHA. They should not be a matter for the Secretary of State or for primary legislation, because circumstances vary across the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) earlier had the courtesy to inform me that he intended to speak on the revenue support grant in the House this afternoon, and I admit that I encouraged him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gives us the satisfaction of treating seriously our amendments and debates in Committee. Many of my hon. Friends and I, and the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, referred not only to NHS trusts but to directly managed hospitals, because in the new commercial environment created by the Bill they will both be under the same commercial pressure to reduce specialties. It is therefore wrong to let the DHAs define the core specialties because they will have a financial temptation to reduce services. That is why we want the list of core specialties to be set out nationally. If the Minister proposes future regulations as a way of rendering the amendments nugatory, will he give us an idea of the nature of the regulations? Will they, for instance, specify the specialties that are contained in the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between NHS trusts and directly managed hospitals. When we discuss NHS trusts later we shall find that the Bill contains details of the delegation of responsibility for certain issues by the Secretary of State to the trusts. Directly managed hospitals are those subject to a degree of control by DHAs. Over several years, we hope to increase the proportion of NHS trusts in relation to directly managed hospitals. The hon. Member for Livingston argued for a guaranteed minimum range of services—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I argued for national standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall deal with standards on clause 4. He argued for a range of services that must be provided in different districts by directly managed hospitals. The Government have a different approach. The hon. Gentleman and I, and our respective parties, believe in cash-limiting the hospital service, a policy that was introduced by the last Labour Government. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) may have forgotten that, because he alluded to the evils of cash limiting. If the hospital service is cash limited, each DHA must, by definition, be cash limited. We believe in firm, cash-limited allocations, unlike drug budgets, to each DHA. It is for the DHAs to discharge their responsibility for the procurement of services to satisfy the health needs of those in their catchment area. There is a sharp difference of opinion and of approach between us. The hon. Member for Livingston
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
wants prescription and we believe in flexibility in defining health care needs and in the procurement of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne. Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I take it that from now on, core services is a term of art that will be applied only the NHS trusts? If that is so, can we take it that in the document "Contracts for Health Services: Operational Principles" issued in late autumn last year, paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 refer to core services that are defined not merely on the basis of NHS trusts? Have paragraphs 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 of the document been withdrawn? If so, have the health authorities and regional general managers, who were sent a previous copy of the document, been informed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have made it plain that core services is a term used only in relation to NHS trusts. I accept that there was confusion in the past. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the document on operational principles is to be withdrawn. The answer is certainly not. I believe that the beginning of that document explains why the term core services should be applied only in relation to trusts. If that explanation is not there, I apologise. I am telling the Committee precisely what is our view of the term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Ministers reponse to my earlier comments was uncharacteristically savage. He accused me of scaremongering about the disappearance of local services as a result of the Bill, but his reply confirms my worst fears. He is extremely vague about the issue of core services, which is at the heart of the Bill. What can we tell our constituents who ask what effect the Bill will have on existing services? I believe that a significant number of existing services will be lost. Core services must be guaranteed in this clause. If the Minister does not give us further information, we shall continue to press the issue because it has serious implications for our constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have several more comments to make. I shall understand if the Member for Livingston wishes to press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and the hon. Member for Livingston are confused about the responsibilities of DHAs. A DHA has a responsibility to ensure that health care needs of its resident population are assessed and met through the contracting mechanism by directly-managed hospitals, NHS trusts, and perhaps hospitals outside the district boundary. There is a difference between that responsibility, which must be discharged, and the provision of services. We shall help those involved to discharge their responsibility through regulations that will be laid in due course under the 1977 legislation. It would be wrong to be too prescriptive and to define the responsibilities in terms of services as the Member for Livingston would wish. That is the clear difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer briefly to the duties of the DHAs. They have a responsibility to plan for the comprehensive health care of their residents. We have set in train development work, centrally funded by the Department of Health, to enable 11 DHAs to begin the process of learning how they should discharge that new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
function from April 1991. The districts are Newcastle, Hull, North Derbyshire, Cambridge, North Hertfordshire, Parkside, Lewisham and North Southwark, Maidstone, Wandsworth, West Dorset and the Wirral. They represent a broad geographic and demographic range of districts. They are beginning the process of learning how to discharge the new responsibility. We hope that the lessons learnt over the coming months will be available to all DHAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Gentlemen raised the accident and emergency issue. I shall explain how the access of non-residents to accident, emergency and inpatient services will be costed. For accident and emergency services we shall require the DHA to provide an accident and emergency service for all comers, whether they are resident in this country or abroad. That service will be funded as a whole by the local DHA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If accident and emergency patients have to be admitted to a ward, the Secretary of State will prescribe the rates of charge by the inpatient wards for the services rendered to the district in which the patient is usually resident. That will be laid in regulations or in an administrative circular. If the patient is resident in this country, standard costs will be charged to the district and paid automatically. If the patient is resident abroad, the Scretary of State for Health will discharge that financial obligation direct to the hospital providing the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations laid under the 1977 legislation will state that accident and emergency services are to be provided to all comers. The regulations will also change the basis of obligation from services within a district boundary to an obligation on the health authority to care for the health needs of its residents. That is a sharp change in function which requires a change in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to core services, under schedule 2, the Secretary of State will be able to direct that they must remain within a trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put it plainly, the Government want hospital trusts established everywhere. If my DHA gets together with Kirklees and becomes a hospital trust we could lose our accident and emergency service, because they could decide to buy it from somewhere else. I can tell my constituents that they could lose their accident and emergency services as a result of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what you cannot say to your constituents. It is irrational for you to draw that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. "You" directed at another member of the Committee is out of order. If it used as a substitute for "one", the impersonal pronoun, it is all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to ask you. Dame Janet, to do anything as Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for any member of the Committee to draw the conclusion that the hon. Lady has drawn. The location of accident and emergency services must be an operational matter, and the DHA must decide sensibly where to locate them. Nothing in the Bill will change the distribution, the composition or the running of those services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said a few times that it is up to the health authority, but he has forgotten that we have debated the health authority structure. He has forgotten that the people within it who brought in health service facilities will have changed. He has forgotten also that the Government rejected the amendments that would have required members of the new health authority boards to put forward people's wishes as well as acting as observers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure the people of Barnsley that their general hospital—and I stress "general" because of the breadth of services that it provides—will keep its existing services? I want his assurance even though that hospital is to exchange facilities with Sheffield hospital, and regardless of whether the hospitals become trusts or opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If the hon. Member for Livingston were Secretary of State for Health, he would not give that guarantee either. The hon. Gentleman knows that. The operation and distribution of services, and the location of a hospital or service are not matters on which politicians should prescribe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) asked me about guidance on model contracts. In working paper 2, we changed our original timetable for introducing them. We now propose that from 1 April 1991, all DHAs will be funded on the basis of residence. The original proposal was for a two-year period, starting with those that had trusts and what were then called GP practice budget holders. We now realise that it would be simpler and more coherent if the basis for funding all districts were changed. Bloomsbury, for example, has about £80 million, but its funding will fall to £20 million. Some of the shire districts, which send patients into London, will see their allocations rise significantly. However, the basis of changing to residency funding will not change the nature of services provided, at least in the first year. Higher allocations will flow out from the district to the hospitals and to the districts where patients are being looked after outside their own district. It is a change in the basis of funding. Weighted capitation is the basis of allocating the real amount of funds available for those who live in a district, but that system will come in over a number of years as districts move to a fairer and more sensible system of resource allocation. The new basis of allocating funds will commence on 1 April 1991. I assure that hon. Gentleman that we shall soon publish model guidance on the contracts that we envisage both for block contracts—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I have been asked about model contracts and I am using the same phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intended to publish guidance shortly, and I shall bring those contracts to the attention of the House and will set out the format that we expect to see in block contracts between DHAs and directly managed hospitals, and the more sophisticated contracts that we expect between a DHA, other districts and other hospitals for the provision, for example, of certain classes of elective surgery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.00 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat what I said before. The Minister says that the guidance will be published in the near future but why is it not available to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
Committee today? We understand that it already exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister said that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) could not give guarantees on core services in various parts of the country. I can assure the Minister that my hon. Friend, if he were the Minister, could certainly give me guarantees on the maternity unit in west Cumbria because it covers a large area of the Lake District. I can think of no conditions in which a Labour Government would close it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask the Minister once again if it is true that under the Bill's proposals the maternity unit that services west Cumbria could be closed in favour of the maternity units that exist in Carlisle, Kendal or other parts of the country? Will the pressure to do that arise only because of the need, perhaps, within the self-governing trust, or the directly managed hospital, to save money or choose more profitable areas of medical practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked why we were not producing the model guidance contracts now. Ministers have not considered them. Districts and officials within the Department of Health have put a considerable amount of work and effort into these—I commend to the hon. Gentleman "Operation Principles", which sets out our thinking clearly. In due course, and in due time, when we have considered them properly, they will be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked also about maternity services. That is a matter not for me but for the DHAs. The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the CHC procedure, which I have said clearly we do not propose to change, is a valuable mechanism. If there are proposals by the district that are objected to by the CHC—a number affect maternity services—and on referral to the RHA that objection is still maintained. Ministers will make the final decision. It is not for Ministers to make the initial decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Minister could clarify for the Committee a point I raised about residency on Second Reading. The Pembrokeshire DHA has a population of more than 100,000 but in the summer that triples to 300,000. In the calculations for the resident population, will there be a calculation for the increased population for holiday areas such as my own and, I suspect, that of my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) who has the same problem? Will we suffer because of that increased population?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer on tourism pressures and large populations in the summer is that that is a perfectly appropriate factor to be taken into account by RHAs in their allocations. I can give my hon. Friend an assurance on that. When we allocate money from the Department of Health to regions, a number of factors other than residency are taken into account such as morbidity, demography, above-average population in long-stay mental handicap hospitals and the relative cost of providing services. That particularly applies in the Greater London area for the four Thames regions. When it comes to the regions allocating money to the districts, I accept my hon. Friend's valid argument. I would also argue that social
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
deprivation is another perfectly valid factor to be taken into account by regional health authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister again on one point? He has just said that the document entitled "Contracts for Health Services: Operational Principles", sets out his Department's thinking clearly. In front of me I have a photocophy of a document that I obtained from the Minister's private office 10 days ago which appears to be the same document. I draw the Minister's attention to paragraphs 1.2(B), 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 of that document, which refer to core services. Those sections make no distinction whatever between NHS trusts and normal contracts. I shall be happy to hand this photocopy to the Minister. Will he tell me whether those sections of this document have been withdrawn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of a certain hon. Gentleman, and doubtless for certain parts of the outside world, I hope that I have clarified a situation where there may have been confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) asked me about summer visitors. I want to make it plain for the record—my hon. Friend the Minister for Health has reminded me, that I was talking about accident and emergency facilities for in-patient services—that if something is serious, a mechanism exists for a patient's own DHA—where he is normally resident—to pay for the costs. I was speaking about the size and scope of the accident and emergency services which are the responsibility of the DHA and for which there is no proposal for repayments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Mon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than allaying our fears about this part of the Bill the Minister is increasing them substantially in his responses to our questions. He is really being probed now, and we have found, for example, that the original commitment to core services does not mean what it says. Are we supposed to look into Ministers minds to find out what is meant rather than take notice of what is written in the White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely that most telling point is the logic of the Minister's argument about the provision of services. Unless the Bill addresses the requirement for DHAs to make provision for specific medical purposes, for example, maternity care, a DHA could discharge its obligations if it bought in every single service from a neighbouring authority and not breach the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that we shall shortly be discussing that issue when we deal with the hon. Gentleman's amendments to clause 4.1 shall therefore conclude my remarks and invite my hon. Friends and the Committee as a whole to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman) 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an illuminating debate about an important series of amendments. The heart of the concern expressed by Opposition Members is whether their constituents and people in other constituencies will have guaranteed local access to the services that they need. Points have been raised about accident and emergency services and Opposition Members feel strongly that those services need to be provided near at hand. Maternity services should also be provided locally to encourage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
women to attend antenatal clinics. They should not be discouraged by having to travel great distances. We also want to ensure that women can get to a hospital by the time they deliver their babies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have talked about the importance of local access for services for children to ensure that they receive all of the preventive checks and services they need to ensure a healthy adulthood. They will not have such ready access to those services if their DHA has bought services from a neighbouring hospital some distance away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard concern expressed about provision for the elderly of a range of integrated services that they can reach locally, with guaranteed access.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady specify what she means by "a little nearer town". If my wife has another baby, or if a neighbour needs urgent treatment, both would have to travel 20 to 25 miles to the nearest district general hospital. I understand the the hon. Lady's anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This issue should be met in the Bill because, for the first time, we shall have a system that allows a DHA to send patients out of its area, under contract, to obtain services from a different district rather than providing those services in its own district. Anxiety has been expressed about accident and emergency services, maternity services and services for children and the elderly. There are many reasons why local access is important. First, it is because some people will not obtain essential services if they have to travel to get them. A person who has undergone surgery and needs to return for a post-operative out-patient check-up—an important procedure—might be deterred by having to travel 60 miles to the hospital at which he had the operation. We want integrated services where hospitals work closely with GPs and community services so that there is a concentrated approach to the individual rather than different units providing different services for each patient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely a balance must be struck. Under the new arrangements, a great many districts will have the certainty of being able to command services for patients, many of whom will find it more convenient to cross a DHA boundary than to be confined by it. The whole basis of quality in contracts must take account of that ability among many other issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present position is that if services are available locally, the patient and his GP have a choice of whether to go locally or to travel. Because of anxiety about the contract system and about patients perhaps having to travel hither and thither, depending on their condition, and, because of the Government's anticipation of that anxiety, they invented the fig leaf or core services. Those services were only ever a flimsy promise in the White Paper. The definition and redefinition of core services between publication of the White Paper and their non-appearance in the Bill shows that they were nothing more than a sop to the genuine anxieties people have about having to travel.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The plain fact is that when hon. Members decide to vote, unless they vote for the amendments, they will be leaving their constituents without the protection of a guarantee of access to local accident and emergency, maternity and child health services, and services for the elderly. If hon. Members want their constituents to have the security of knowing that such services will be provided locally, they must vote for the amendments. If they vote against them we will know that they are happy to accept a contract system in which patients can be sent for treatment wherever it is provided cheapest. The Opposition do not accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MORI poll is totally irrelevant. The issue is not whether people are prepared to travel because they are desparate after waiting for two years, but whether our objective is to provide prompt—and local—services. Tory constituents will be interested in knowing whether their Members of Parliament have stood up for their interests or betrayed them by voting to leave them without the protection of essential local services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lady must not assume that because my hon. Friends do not agree with her interpretation of events, we have any less regard for our constituents and their welfare. We happen to accept that the pressures on the NHS are such that unless major reforms of this nature—which take political courage—are given form, there will not be an NHS for our constituents in the year 2000.

The health authority already proposes closing down that department and forcing people to travel north to Manchester for services.

I must have an answer to a question. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) spoke of a fig leaf being torn away. What worries me is the blank space that appears to lie behind the fig leaf. I have laid before the Minister the relevant sections of the document that he says provide comprehensive guidance on operational principles.

The definition of "core services" in that document is at variance with the hon. Gentleman's definition. On matters such as these, we cannot make up legislation as we go long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, while repeating for the fifth time my comments on core services. The term has meaning only in relation to NHS trusts. The definition of a core service whose provision is necessary in a NHS trust hospital also applies—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The document to which the hon. Gentleman refers is a consultation paper, not a legal document. A core service as defined in relation to a NHS trust relates also to a directly managed hospital. The definition of a service—be it maternity, surgical or otherwise—as a core service to be provided by a NHS trust has meaning for a directly managed hospital also, but because the hospital remains directly managed, the DHA is able to ensure that the core service remains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the amendments made a similar point, we have discussed, in general terms, the purchaser-provider distinction, and it is clear that the Government do not have a clear enough conception of the distinction. In addition to the difficulties of principle that we debated earlier, there is a morass of uncertainty about what that distinction will mean in practice. The difficulties were compounded by the Minister's statements. In clause 3 we are confronted with the purchaser-provider distinction; we discover that effective guidance on the matter may be issued in a few weeks time. But that will be too late because our debates will have finished. That is intolerable. There is a set of entirely new principles that we want to contest, but we are effectively denied scrutiny because we do not have the relevant practical information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a Health Service that is driven by needs and wishes, not by the accumulated weight of institutions' vested interests and procedures that underpin the providers and make elective acute surgery the centre of the issues and the debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purchaser-provider distinction makes the fatal error of putting elective acute surgery back at the centre of affairs. Amendent No. 257 challenges that principle. It is an extremely modest amendment. It asks only that in addition to the primary functions defined in the 1977 legislation, there shall be a duty on a health authority to advise the population that it serves of its range of services and the likely waiting time for them. Every citizen served by a health authority has a right to see such a document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 257 further provides that there shall be a duty to monitor the quality and delivery of the services. If there are to be purchaser-provider distinctions, the amendment strengthens the hand of the purchaser who acts on behalf of the community. That is the minimum requirement for a needs-driven NHS. The Government claim that that is what they want. If that is true, they will accept the amendment. To judge from the way that they are acting, I suspect that almost any lifeboat will do. We are happy to launch one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating important issues. It is clear from the evidence of our discussions that the Government are considerably confused about the effects of the legislation. The amendment would help the Government in their distress. It would enable them to clutch something that will be the basis of the future NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in the unaccustomed position of playing Trilby: unfortunately my Svengali is in the Chamber. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) asked me to speak to the amendments tabled in his name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 228 would ensure that the Secretary of State remains directly responsible for the minimum standards to be provided by health authorities and GPs. It seeks to ensure that the minimum standards achieved will be the same whether the service is provided directly or indirectly by a DHA. The amendment probes the Government's intentions on quality control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) said that there was confusion about principle and practice in the distinction between the purchaser-provider roles. That is not so. None of my hon. Friends is in any doubt about the distinction in principle and in practice. Any confusion lies with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, I shall try to answer his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with his desire for clear information about waiting times and the importance of monitoring quality. He is confused however, about the provision of information on services. It is not the services provided within the district that matters but the range of services available to the residents of that district. There is a difference of approach between the Opposition and the Government in defining the roles of the purchaser and the provider of services. Though I subscribe to the importance of providing information—to that extent I agree with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central—it should not be in the capacity of a local provider, but in that of a health authority responsible for ensuring that a range of services is made available, both in district and out district, to the residents of that district. I encouarge districts to publish such information; primary legislation is not the right vehicle for doing so. I have seen many examples of excellent reports spelling out the services that are available within districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Gentleman for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central said about waiting times. We have taken steps to introduce development trials to provide GPs with information about waiting times. One is operated manually in the West Midlands, down telephone lines and on card indexes; another is a computer-driver information technology trial in Cambridgeshire. Thus GPs have direct access to information about waiting times and lists at local hospitals. We have no timetable, but over the next few years, as I said in Birmingham yesterday to a conference of Health Service managers, we anticipate that GPs—those in primary care—will have direct access to such information and receive back from hospitals, using modern information technology, information on diagnosis and discharge, to speed up the process between hospital and general practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central asked about monitoring quality. What he said was absolutely right. The point was raised also by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that amendment No. 257 does not attempt to
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
contain services provided by a district within its own boundaries; it simply states "it provides", without any geographical distinction. Moreover, it refers to "population served", and certainly in Newcastle we are puzzled as to whether the residential population served includes or excludes the 12,000 students in the city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but the Bill—indeed, primary legislation—is not the right vehicle. I give him an undertaking, as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), that when we draft the regulations under the 1977 Act, we shall read the record of this debate and consider the rational and sensible arguments that he has deployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister ask his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland whether similar trials are being instituted in Scotland, because we have been pressing hard for a computer-driven waiting list and waiting time availability for doctors, GPs, patients and, of course. Members of Parliament? Are those waiting lists and times related to individual consultants as well as to individual specialties within hospitals, and is it possible to relate the waiting lists and times for individual consultants to whether or not they are employed on a part-time or full-time contract with the NHS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of trials have been conducted on the use of technology to provide waiting-list information and on the use of view data systems to provide other information, including information about local formularies and matters of that kind. The most advanced system is probably the one now taking place in Lothian, known as the Vadis system. Development packages are being evolved for the G-Pass software system, which is used by GPs and which we plan to extend. We recently announced that there would be financial support for GPs who wished to expand their technology base, and I agree that it is an area in which we need to expand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude my remarks by responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent. I appreciate that he was speaking to an amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton. No doubt we shall return later this afternoon to the matter of standards. My hon. Friend must be right about the importance of quality of service but is not only the quantity of care provided and its price that matter in our proposed contracting system. Quality is pre-eminently important, and my hon. Friend will see from the document on operational principles for contracts that we devote significant attention to quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall consult professional bodies about standard settings. I know that the Royal College of Nursing, a distinguished professional body, has addressed the importance of minimum standards in the delivery of certain care by different categories of nurses. I myself had a presentation on the subject earlier this week. So although I suspect that primary legislation is not the right way to proceed in this respect, I stress that the quality of service is absolutely essential, and I hope that my hon. Friend will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In addition to carrying out its primary functions, each regional, district and special health authority shall ensure that the range of specialities and facilities provided, and the volume of cases treated within its boundaries are adequate to sustain training, continuing education, and research.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment brings us to an area in which Britain still has the edge in medical provision—medical training and medical research. It is because of the excellence of medical education and research that British hospitals still attract from overseas many doctors for undergraduate and postgraduate training. One of the strengths of the NHS is that, having attracted those people to study, develop and train in Britain, many of them subsequently stay to practice here. Indeed, our Health Service would be in serious difficulty without the overseas doctors who came here to study and stayed to practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and given that we are debating an area—there are not many—in which Britain still has a leading role in the scientific world, it is important that we should retain that lead and protect those centres of excellence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to concentrate on medical research. Considerable anxiety has been expressed by all the organisations concerned with medical research in Britain about the effect of the Government's proposals. Medical research is not a luxury, it is the foundation of future medical advances. This is recognised by the public although perhaps not always by the present Administration. The public are prepared to respond with great generosity to appeals for medical research funds. Their generosity is such that we have now reached the rather curious outcome that the medical research charities between them fund more medical research than the Medical Research Council, which is funded by the Government. This is partly a consequence of Government constraints on
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
research; it is also a tribute to the striking public recognition of the importance of medical research and their preparedness to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strength of that investment, whether publicly or charitably funded, is that it is directed to a publicly managed service in which decisions on patient management are not determined solely by cost. Therefore, a modest investment in medical research can yield substantial achievements in medical knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four anxieties have been expressed about the effects of the White Paper on research and about the extent to which it will complicate the attempt by those who pursue medical research to continue their present work and achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first anxiety takes us to the heart of the commercial ethic that rests at the centre core - or spine - of the White Paper. It is the introduction of a commerical ethos and the stressing of cost in the allocating of resources. I avoid, the use of the word "core", which seems to melt before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that medical research is expensive and that it adds to the cost of any form of treatment. In response to last summers's White Paper, the MRC spelt out usefully and helpfully the way in which research adds to costs It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Research, wherever it is conducted and whatever its long term benefits to cost-effective health care, in the short term adds to the costs of medical care: more staff time, longer hospital stays, additional laboratory monitoring, extra out patient attendances, additional reporting for epidemiological and health services research studies".</p></blockquote>
For the benefit of those who wish to defend expenditure on medical research and in hospitals, they should recognise that it is expensive, that it adds to costs, that it is bound to draw all research staff to the attention of the financial directors of the new NHS trusts and DHA's, and that it is not revenue producing. Faced with expenditure that is both expensive and non-revenue producing, there can be no doubt that many who are closely involved in research will find themselves under the scrutiny of financial directors who will ask awkard questions about whether a hospital can, or should, continue with such expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much medical research is not a matter of scientists and laboratories undertaking research independently of what happens in hospitals. The great bulk of achievement in medical research comes about through careful recording and through investigation of patients passing through hospitals. That is likely to be squeezed out by the-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr Kenneth Clarke) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled about the factual basis of one of the Gentleman's assertions. He said that the conducting of research in NHS hospitals would not be revenue producing, as he puts its. As the service increment for teaching arrangements ensure that additional costs of research will be fully reimbursed, and as the contract arrangements in the remaindeer of the Health Service will ensure that the cost of service will be reimbursed fully by the purchasing authority, what is the factual basis of his extraordinary fear that research will be on a different footing from other aspects of the Health Service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basis for that fear was expressed by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, whose members stated clearly - I thought that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would know this -that the service increment for teacher training caters for training costs, but research costs throughout universities and teaching hospitals are not directly proportionate to training costs in those hospitals. Therefore it is conceivable that a SIFT payment would be made to meet training costs while leaving exposed a large volume of research costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Secretary of State to listen to what I am about to say. I am about to make the second assertion, which takes us to the heart of my contention that if staff are serious about research projects they may require a number of years and a high volume of patients. Over those years those patients may require additional investigations and tests which will not be funded through SIFT but which will be essential for gathering data to decide whether a research project is valid and its conclusions well based. Those thorough investigations and additional tests are likely to be squeezed out by financial directors anxious to achieve a cost-competitive contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is thrashing around a little. He said that SIFT covers training. He has not noticed the recent Government decision to extend SIFT to the cost of research in universities where there are medical students. Therefore his bland assertion, the first plank of his argument, that research is not revenue-producing is untrue. He is trying to concoct a picture of a commercial service in which research will not be reimbursed whereas, as a precursor to these reforms, we have improved the basis upon which the additional costs of research will be delivered alongside the delivery of services to patients are reimbursement to DHAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would willingly and cheerfully admit to the Secretary of State that, because he plans to introduce a commerce-based system to the NHS, he has been obliged to increase payments through SIFT. I am well aware of that and acknowledge it. That, however, will not compensate those hospitals and university centres of excellence for the additional expenditure which they shoulder now because they want the advantage of a wide range of patients with a wide range of tests, all of which will come under pressure if they are obliged to compete for patients on a cost-price basis. That is the point at issue. None of that will be compensated by the Secretary of State's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman's proposals for SIFT and for research are intended to compensate for certain expenditures. I need hardly tell him - he is aware of how the world of commerce operates, having been at the Department of Trade and Industry - that the financial directors of the hospitals will be looking not only for activities for which they will be reimbursed but activities that will produce a rate of return as well as reimbursement. They will not be particulary pleased with those parts of a hospital which merely says that they may receive part reimbursement for the Department of Health. They will look for surgeons and consultants who can attract patients on whom they can eventually make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
My third assertion will be familiar to the Secretary of State, and I trust that he will not contest it. His self-governing trusts will have power to set their own salaries; that is one of the patent discretions that he is to give them, on the basis of local people making local decisions. He will not be unaware of the substantial concern expressed by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and others about what that will mean for university staff who are paid now on the same basis as hospital consultants, who have considerable difficulty maintaining an adequate salary for their qualifications and requirements and who, in future, are most unlikely to be able to match the higher salaries that may be paid by some of the prestigious teaching hospitals which are thinking of opting out. In these circumstances, there could be the serious difficulty of the payment of those employed by universities and those employed by the medical research charities matching the salaries of the new free market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth and final cause for anxiety has been raised widely: the consequence of a commerce-based system on the case mix that would then pass through the hospitals. There are two ways in which that might be affected. First, a financial director of a hospital will understandably, look for a high volume throughput of patients so as to minimise his costs, meet his overheads and maximise his profitability for competing on costs with other hospitals. Simultaneously, there may be a tendency on the part of GPs who may have their own funds or, indeed, DHA's looking for where they can buy their contracts most cheaply, to discourage referrals to specialist and tertiary centres where treatment will be much more expensive than perhaps at other places that are less training and research based. The consequence of that could have a serious impact on the case mix which research teams require if they are to maintain the research projects that they are currently running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone doubts - it appears that the Secretary of State, does - that the commercial ethos forecast in the White Paper, that the Bill is designed to achieve, will discourage the research-based projects and works in a hospital, I invite my hon. Friends to contemplate the scene that exists throughout the entire private hospital sector. I could travel round them all without finding one significant research project that is funded by a hospital or is being shouldered as part of its budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the Secretary of State has made all the right noises on this issue. We have heard some of them this evening. As always, there is a gulf between the Minister's rhetoric and the Bill. It seems that "research" appears in the Bill only in schedule 2, which provides that the NHS trusts will be empowered to conduct research. It does not require them, however, to conduct research. It is competent for them to do so, and I do not think that many of the trusts will wish not to carry out research, but no duty will be placed upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is relying on his reserve powers to ensure that research is not removed from the contracts placed with self-governing hospitals. I shall quote what the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principles said on this matter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is like bolting the door after the horse has gone. The planning
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
of medical education cannot be left on such an unsatisfactory and unpredictable basis."</p></blockquote>
Two problems arise from relying on the Secretary of State's reserve powers in relation to NHS trusts. First, and the Secretary of State will be the first to admit that he is one removed in the contract between the DHAs and the NHS trusts, it is said that this is a matter for local determination. Therefore, the right hon. and learned Gentleman will have to exercise his reserve power to intervene in that negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is not only the NHS trusts that will feel the commercial pressure. It is impossible not to refer back to the exchanges we had in the previous debate during which—I have to say this to my hon. Friends—we failed to get across to the Under-Secretary that the commercial pressures unleashed by the Bill will not apply only to those hospitals that wish to become NHS trusts. They will apply inevitably across the range of the major hospitals, including the directly managed ones. Whether or not they choose to be NHS trusts, they will be obliged to compete with those NHS trusts for patients, on the same basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to secure the future of research, surely it will be prudent to write into the Bill, when we are considering the functions and duties of health authorities, that those authorities have a duty to secure research and protect research where it exists within their hospitals. Whoever replies to the debate may suggest that this is the wrong point at which to write that provision into the Bill, or say, as did the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), that the amendments are written in straightforward English and therefore are technically defective. During my time in this place I have never moved an amendment that did not subsequently turn out to be technically defective. One of the reasons that I aspire to change places with the right hon. and learned Gentleman is that some day in the course of my career I may move an amendment that is not technically defective. I am perfectly willing to take these points on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next argument is not particulary partisan but is one advanced by those who do not necessarily have affiliations with my party or any other party on the Opposition Benches. It relates to a matter that has caused concern across the political spectrum to those who are anxious about research. I earnestly urge and beg Conservative Members to accept that if they are going to release commercial forces and put the Health Service on the basis of confining itself to the placement of contracts—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> In my time, many people have walked out during my speeches but not with the rapidity of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). I signalled to the hon. Gentleman that I was winding up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg the Minister's colleagues who are left in the Room to take on board that if the commercial ethos is to be unleashed in the Health Service, we should ensure that somewhere in the Bill, not necessarily through the amendment, we take the elementary step of protecting training research in our hospitals and give to those who are investing over a long period the security of knowing that their research, and the Health Service's interest in their research, will continue beyond the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly in support of the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). I am sorry to see the Scottish Under-Secretary making for the door, and I am grateful that his twin seems to be momentarily corrected. I shall not detain him long. I thought my comments would have been of particular interest to him in two respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to a speech that was made by the principal of the University of Glasgow. Members of the Committee will know that that is a fine teaching establishment in the medical sector. More appropriately, perhaps, prior to taking up his appointment as principal of the university Sir William Fraser was the permanent secretary at the Scottish Office. If anyone can speak with a degree of insight on the workings of Government at the highest level and the workings of universities with respect to medical research, the continuing pursuit of inquiry, investigation and technical and scientific excellence, it is Sir William.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the speech delivered by Sir William Fraser in December 1989 to a graduation ceremony at the university certainly speaks for itself and is worth reading into the record. I shall be interested to hear what Ministers say in response to the points Sir William makes, which are pertinent, and hope that his words are not wasted on the Scottish Health Minister. Sir Wiliam was reported as saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"medical education was under serious threat from the market philosophy being applied to the National Health Service."</p></blockquote>
The report continued by making the valid point that
	<br><blockquote><p>"medical education depended upon the medical and nursing staff in the NHS and without their 'willing and massive co-operation""—</p></blockquote>
anyone, including Ministers, who has listened to the progress of this issue, even long before the Bill was published, will have to admit that "willing and massive co-operation" has not been the hallmark of the medical sector given the lack of consultation and, indeed, downright provocation and aggression against it. The report continues by saying that with
	<br><blockquote><p>"the interaction between university and health service facilities, it would not be possible to produce the next generation of doctors."</p></blockquote>
To quote Sir William directly, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Much of what the health service does for the universities is not quantified, and the opposite is also true. If there are now to be detailed budgets and if. for instance, one hospital board is to make a precise charge for a precise service given to another hospital board, then all the things which are presently the subject of "knock for knock" arrangements will have to be brought into the open, assessed, priced, permitted or denied, encouraged or discouraged, according to the criteria of the market."</p></blockquote>
He added that medical education was being seen as
	<br><blockquote><p>""some sort of add-on. a non-optional extra"</p></blockquote>
which the manager of the health service would have to put up with. He continued by saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"his board will receive monetary compensation—a sort of disturbance allowance—because in certain hospitals the cost of medical treatment is increased as a consequence of having students about the place."</p></blockquote>
Surely that is self-evident, but the point seems to be lost on the Minister. Sir William is further quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Naturally, health board managers want to be successful, but their success is to be judged by results which have nothing to do with medical education.".</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of a man who understands the

higher reaches of government, and who knows what it is like to preside over and represent one of our largest universities, which is also a centre of medical excellence. I hope that his wisdom will not be lost on Ministers. I suspect that we are about to find out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his press-cutting service, but has he had an opportunity to read the letter that was sent to Sir William in reply to his speech, or seen the press cuttings covering all of the points that he raised? Why does the hon. Gentleman not quote the principal of Aberdeen university, which is nearer to his constitutency? That Principal wrote at length in The Scotsman, supporting self-governing hospitals, saying that they and the Bill will greatly enhance opportunities for research and training. Was not the hon. Gentleman selective in the information that he made available to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that I chose the principal of Glasgow university because he is the only principal of a Scottish university who has also been a Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Office. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong. Sir William's input and insights are especially pertinent, as he must be aware of the considerations and arguments that contributed to the evaluation of health issues within the Scottish Home and Health Department. If the Minister would display his characteristic ministerial humility, he would give more credence to the views of a man of such distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I give credence to Sir William's views. That is why we responded positively and constructively to his graduation address. We are considering the interests of research in universities, however, which are not always the same as those of civil servants in the Scottish Home and Health Department. The hon. Gentleman argued that experience of a centrally controlled system is important in determining the quality of research, but I argue that other university principals take a different view. I suspect that the latter view will prevail in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What did the Minister mean when he said that the interests of civil servants were not always identical with those of research and universities? Who does he criticise more in saying that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A system that allows hospitals to take dicisions at hospital level, and allows universities to compete and take decisions at university level, is more likely to produce good quality research and good decisions than one that is controlled centrally by a Government Department with a grand mandarin at the helm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. It is one of the Minister's more Luddite comments—there are many others. He is living in cloud-cuckoo land if he really believes that, in the competitive world, with increasing emphasis on science and technology as a means of advancing medicine—apart from anything else—excellence can be achieved on an international level without central funding and direction. He should look at our major competitors and other industrialised states for evidence of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members with Scottish constituencies, I have heard several speeches by Sir William Kerr Fraser. I have attended only one graduation, and by chance it was the one at which Sir William made his speech. In contrast to the Minister's reaction, there was a temendous response to Sir William's views, for two reasons. First, he spoke on behalf of Glasgow university, and its staff and students. Secondly, people recognise his experience and status as a former principal, and as a senior civil servant—he was recently at the Scottish Office. The Minister does not seem to have absorbed that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) for that intervention. I can reflect only ruefully on his comment that he attended only one graduation, it being the one at which the speech was made, because I have attended only one graduation: my own. I do not know whether that reflects a difference between us!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a valid point. The Minister's original intervention was characteristic in that any criticism, however well-informed and weighty-one cannot be better informed in this issue than Sir William Kerr Fraser—is dismissed with a reference to what others are saying or doing. The message that was delivered is all too easily overlooked; however, that is a characteristic of the present Administration and not only of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to intervene in tribal wars north of the border, but the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) remarked that managers will wish to be a success and that training is therefore likely to go out of the window. Surely the exact opposite is the case. Any well-run organisation that can show a commitment to education and training will be well equipped to recruit and keep its staff. That is especially true when there is an enormous demographic squeeze on young people entering each of the professions in the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely pious hope. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. I was quoting the principal of Glasgow university. Sir William would have responded, as he can now, by proxy, to the point that the hon. Gentleman made. Sir William went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Naturally, health board managers want to be successful, but their success is to be judged by results which have nothing to do with medical education."</p></blockquote>
By way of further clarification, he argued that that education should be seen as a joint responsibility of universities and the NHS. He said that, unless that happened, the drive for greater efficiency, effectiveness and economy would lead to medical education merely being tolerated, rather than being discharged with pride. His argument is very convincing, and I rest my contribution to the debate on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the chance to make a brief contribution to the debate. The Opposition, on top of their alleged monopoly of caring, do not have any entitlement in the amendments to seize a monopoly of interest in education and research. I say that advisedly because I am the only member of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
Committee who is currently a member of one of the research councils. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health was previously a member of the Medical Research Council. I cannot aspire to that, but I am a member of the Agricultural and Food Research Council. I followed the debate closely because I am also the president of a private sector trust that specialises in agricultural research. The relative size of that private and charitable sector is incomparably lower than the respective sector in medicine. The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) was gracious enough to emphasise the importance of charity, which is also an interest of mine, in funding medical research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many areas of the biological sciences the work of the research councils, whether natural environment, medical, or the AFRC, is coming together, and they even collaborate on some important projects. We recently appointed—indeed I interviewed—a policy director who came to us from the MRC, and we are very pleased with her performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is as much interest in education, training and research among Conservative Members as among Labour Members. The differences between us are on the means by which that can best be achieved. I ask the Minister to clarify the means and to assure us tht this essential work will be continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an interesting series of exchanges with my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health, on funding. That is the central issue. As I understand it, the MRC or any other organisation can commission and pay for research to be carried out in the NHS whether in a trust hospital or directly. It is not an embarrassment to the cash-flow of a hospital to have research done there, provided it is properly priced. If it is, that research may make an important contribution to overheads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I wish to touch on the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) about quality. Again there is a misconception on the Labour Benches that business, commerce and professionalism squeeze out quality and compassion. That is not so. A modern Health Service will wish to achieve those things to the highest standards. I have said why I believe that hospitals can be resourced through the system proposed by the Government, and I look forward to my right hon. Friend the Minister's reassurances on how it can happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience on research councils, the money that the Government make available through the Department of Education and Science to basic science, whether medical research, agricultural or environmental research, is an index of their commitment, and I should like it reinforced today by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, the debate on the amendments has related primarily to research, with the occasional reference to, but no discussion of education and training. I should like to explain our anxiety about education and training and the motivation behind amendments No. 163 and No. 161. Both amendments are fairly self-explanatory. I emphasise that local provision of education and training facilities within the NHS is a means to ensure that staff are appropriately trained and that there is an important check on local standards. Since I came to Parliament. I have had frequent exchanges of correspondence and debates on
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
the extent of cuts in the Health Service within my own health authority area. The term that was frequently used by the hon. Member for Derbyshire. South (Mrs. Currie) when she was Under-Secretary of State for Health was "changes in service delivery". She did not accept that ward closures and staff being kicked out were cuts. They were "changes in service delivery".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a Wakefield health authority member, before I came into Parliament, problems became so bad that the health authority was threatened with the withdrawal of English National Board validation for general nurse training. The ENB considered standards on some wards to be too low to enable nurses to have appropriate training. The ENB was worried about the provision of such facilities as sinks, wash basins and toilets because of underfunding. Over a considerable period of time, the authority had a dialogue with the ENB which forced the upgrading of those wards to enable the validation of nurse training, which was to patients' benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the proposed changes, it is important to ensure that training is continued, to produce appropriately qualified nursing staff and to maintain facilities at an acceptable level. If hon. Members consider hospital facilities in their constituencies, they will realise why the Opposition want to ensure that appropriate education and training continues at a local level under the new provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud of the general nurse training facilities in Wakefield district health authority, which has proposed conversion courses for enrolled nurses to become RGNs, which I hope will not be threatened by the changes. It has excellent psychiatric nurse training, and conversion courses from enrolled nurses to RNN. There is also a nationally famous school for remedial gymnasts in Wakefield at Pinderfields hospital. I am worried that such facilities will not remain local, as they have given an excellent service for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other worries are being expressed in nursing, such as the need to ringfence nurse training funding. This week's Nursing Standard carries an article on the worries expressed by the ENB about Government proposals for placing nurse training funding into the hands of health authorities, because that is likely to put the future of nurse training at risk. The ENB believes that training money should be ringfenced at board level so that courses cannot be cancelled to channel training money into other areas of the Health Service. The article quotes the chief executive of the ENB, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"giving funding responsibility to RHAs could result in the loss of a national overview of the needs of the workforce."</p></blockquote>
Furthermore, this week's Nursing Times and Nursing Mirror quotes Jean Hooper, the ENB chairwoman, as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When money for education is held in close relation to service needs, education always suffers."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister respond to the ENB's worries about ringfencing and the general points that I have made about education and training within the Health Service during the proposed changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone involved with teaching hospitals who is listening to the debate will be worried by the Minister's intervention. The univer-

	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
sities, by their very existence in teaching hospitals, commit DHAs to substantial expenditure. If representatives of universities were on DHAs they could at least safeguard their positions. Will the Minister comment on that proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief, but at least seven points have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share with the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) a belief that medical research and training is vital. I hope that he welcomed the White Paper "Priorities in Medical Research" published in response to the House of Lords Select Committee. I hope, too, that he welcomes our decision to appoint a chief of research and development, which emphasises the importance that we attach to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another Minister has direct responsibility for research. I pay tribute, however, to the research that is being undertaken at St. Thomas's hospital, which I visited recently, into the treatment of diabetes. That is being carried out with a grant from the European Commission's advanced information in medicine programme. That valuable research into information technology, with which I am more familiar is sponsored largely by the united medical schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) mentioned extra cost. The way in which the NHS compensates hospitals for the excess cost of providing teaching and research was hitherto called SIFT—service increment for teaching. It can now be called SIFTR—service increment for teaching and research. In 1989–90 some £300 million has been spent on SIFT, but we propose to change the arrangements in two respects. First, as I said, research will be included. Secondly, the compensation for excess cost will be increased from 75 per cent, to 100 per cent. That will mean more money spent on resources. I hope that the hon. Member for Livingston agrees that it will be valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston mentioned the distinction between undergraduate teaching hospitals and other research institutions that carry out research. Our present proposals relate only to the undergraduate teaching hospitals. The compensation for excess cost removes the need for recovery through the contracting mechanism. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State is discussing with the Medical Research Council how that principle can be extended to the non-teaching hospitals. It is a complicated issue but I am happy to make that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) and, by implication, the hon. Member for Livingston, raised the issue of knock for knock. That is the system whereby the teaching staff of a medical school operating in parallel with, or on the same site as, a district general hospital will assist with the patients. In return, the hospital will provide some of trie facilities for teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall approach contracting for the informal knock-for-knock arrangements with care: a trial is being carried out at Southampton at present. I assure the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye that we shall proceed with caution because we do not want
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
to throw out informal arrangements for cost-sharing that have worked well for many years. We shall not be blinded by dogma in approaching the disaggregation of those costs in formal arrangements. We shall tread carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what the Minister said, as far as it goes. However, we should pursue the matter to its logical conclusion. Will the Minister withdraw the proposal if the worst fears of the principal of Glasgow university are confirmed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not inviting the Committee to draw any conclusions. Knock-for-knock arrangements work well in the insurance industry, but I do not draw a direct parallel. I repeat that we shall proceed with caution and common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of NHS trusts, research and training, we can write in to the constitution of NHS trusts the obligations that the Secretary of State will want them to continue to uphold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston asked about case mix. He is right that even after the excess cost provisions and their recovery through SIFT, the provision of services at some of the large teaching hospitals or research establishments might be more expensive than elsewhere. That does not include the cost of operating in London. Quality of service is as important, if not more important, than the cost of services. General practitioners will state their strong views about referrals to DHAs and DHAs will be expected to take account of GPs' views on the quality of services, whatever they cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) referred to the training of nurses. He is aware of Project 2000, which will mean that nurses will not be trained on the wards. They will, of course, gain experience on the wards once they have been trained. It will cost a great deal in resources, but we intend to ensure that future student nurses receive a proper academic training outside the wards. I hope that the disadvantages to which the hon. Member for Livingston referred will not apply in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There should, perhaps, be representatives of the university teaching hospitals on the local DHA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that they will be represented: it is in clause 1.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not refer to the ringfencing of funding for nurse training. I raised the matter on behalf of the ENB. I should be grateful for his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
The Minister failed to take account of our argument that to safeguard the activities of the present NHS, it is not sufficient, merely to write down the small print of the contracts for NHS trust hospitals. The directly-managed hospitals that remain in the NHS will not be affectd by the small print of the contractual arrangements for the constitution of NHS trusts. They will, however, be subject to the same wind of commercial change. That is why it would have been helpful for the Under-Secretary, accepting at least the spirit of the amendments, to impose on DHAs a duty to respect training, education and research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I enter a slight note of wounded pride? The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) was rather unfair when he took up my opening remarks. In presenting what I thought was a modest, moderate and reasoned case—not a partisan one—I sought specifically to explain that on this occasion—no doubt we shall do it on other occasions—we were not seeking a monopoly of virtue. There are many people outside the Committee, concerned with medical research and medical training, who are genuinely anxious, and who do not necessarily have a party-political axe to grind. If the Under-Secretary will permit me, I propose to pass on his assurances to those people to see to what extent their anxieties are allayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may wish to return to the matter at a later stage, depending on what they say, but in the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with increasing surprise at the way in which Opposition Members have selected subjects for their amendments and spoken to them. Opposition Members seem to have failed to grasp the essential purport of clause 3. Perhaps they have not noticed its purport; or perhaps they have noticed, and thought that as it reflected rather well on the Government, it would not be a good idea to draw attention to it. Whichever explanation is right, it would be wrong for the Committee to vote on the clause without appreciating the historical move that it represents in the history of the NHS; it provides a rational basis, for the first time, for patients to move across DHA boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, it is possible for doctors to refer patients to consultants and hospitals—the secondary medical services—across DHA boundaries, but when they do so, the services that the patients receive from what might be described as the host DHA are unremunerated, or if the health authority providing the services receives any remuneration at all, its remuneration is received two years later in a change in the RAWP
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
allocation. So any DHA that accepts patients from outside its boundaries under present arrangements does so out of pure altruism, and does so contrary to its own financial and economic interests. Clearly, that is a bad thing, and—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one of the many perverse incentives that ritiate the Health Service in its present form. It is not in the patients' interest that such a perverse incentive operates on the DHAs where they may want to be treated, or where their GP may wish to send them. Equally, it is not in the interest of hospitals or DHAs. It works against the ability of any hospital, any consultant or any team in a hospital, to build a reputation and expertise, or to serve not only local, but wider, specialist requirements with pride and satisfaction. It does not serve the interests of patient care, nor does it help further medical science or improve medical services. Removing that perverse incentive is a significant step towards improving the Health Service, which is an objective that hon. Members on both sides to the Committee share. Subsections (6) and (7), effectively do that. I hope that all members of the Committee, whatever their political prejudices, will therefore support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 4, line 25, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>".but notwithstanding this section, any person may. on referral by their general medical practitioner (whether or not that general medical practitioner is in fund-holding practice) obtain goods or services at any National Health Service hospital, or other establishment or facility, or any National Health Service trust, whether or not there is any National Health Service contract in existence which would cover the provision of such goods or services.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 154, in page 4, line 25, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>(1B) Each district health authority shall establish a contingency fund for extra contractual referrals, the sum set aside for such a fund being no less than 20 per cent, of the value of all that district's National Health Service contract.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the NHS contract system. The amendments would insert into that system the opportunity for patients and their GPs to choose, nowithstanding the contract system, where they receive treatment. I shall comment on the way in which the current system works, discuss how the Bill will change it, and say, finally, how the amendments would mitigate the Bill's bad effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again, Ministers and the Secretary of State have misrepresented the way in which the system operates, and then said that the Bill will make it better. We have a National Health Service. Although provision is made by DHAs, there is choice because patients and GPs are entitled to cross district and regional boundaries. The figures for cross-boundary flow show that many patients choose treatment outside their own districts, and that many GPs refer patients
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
outside their boundaries to receive the best treatment. They do that not because services are unavailable locally, but because patients prefer to receive treatment elsewhere for other reasons. The only restriction is that some cash-starved hospitals in cash-starved DHAs have put up boundaries and said, for the first time, that they will not take patients from outside their district. That is a problem not of the system, but of under funding. If under funding were corrected, there would be no reason why hospital and clinic services should not be available throughout the country so that patients and their doctors could choose where they were treated, irrespective of district and regional boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that the problem has not come about as a result of the present system. Will she reflect upon that, bear in mind my comments on clause 3, and try to understand that a major problem of the system is that at present there is inadequate provision of cash to flow across DHA boundaries, so that DHAs that accept patients from other authorities effectively receive no reward? If that is not an obstacle to patients crossing boundaries, what is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There should be a system to ensure that districts whose services attract patients from outside are compensated. Instead, there will be the straitjacket of a contract system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 provides for the money to follow the patient. The problem, is that in practice, the patient will have to follow the money. If the Government are serious about the money following the patient, they should support our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that there would need to be some arrangements for the funding of transfers across district boundaries. What sort of arrangements has she in mind? This is the essence of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to digress into Labour party policy for solving the problems, although it has a detailed policy. The hon. Gentleman should know that we are now debating the present position and how the Bill will affect it. We think that clause 4 will make the position worse and have tabled amendments that would minimise the harm that the Bill will cause, and the lack of choice that it will impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cross-boundary flow figures show that thousands of patients cross into different regions and districts. The boundaries have no meaning for GPs or patients. For example, women in my constituency who go to St. Thomas's or to Guy's hospitals to have their babies would be astonished if told that they had gone to a different health authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, regional and district boundaries do not impede GPs or patients when they exercise their right to choose the best or most appropriate place for treatment. Choice is more than merely catering for a patient's idiosyncracies. Choice for GPs and their patients is essential to quality of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs Mahon) will mention family planning services. A family planning service that dictates that all women have to go to the same place is not a quality service
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
because people often wish to choose where to go. An insistence that people go to a particular place might result, particularly in family planning services, in a lower uptake of a service that had been contracted for. It is not a matter of idiosyncracy, it is about allowing patients to choose the care that they prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is also important for GPs' referrals. When they decide where to refer patients for treatment, they have the advantage of having seen patients come back from hospitals after operations and other treatment. They develop opinions on where patients have been happiest to go and on where there have been fewest post-operative complications. In the absence of any other data about quality, the GP's instinct about where to refer patients is the most important available indicator of quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present system, individual patients can go where they choose, and GPs can refer where they choose. Under the contract system, all that will change. Provision will be by contract and DHAs will negotiate a contract. For example, they will buy 1,000 hernias for the coming two years and have a remarkably good offer down in Maidstone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So Camberwell district health authority, having been offered a job lot of hernias in Maidstone, will say to GPs, "You're not having your hernias in King's any more because they've become far too expensive on account of capital charges. It will have to do renal work, from which it can make a bit more money and offset the cost of the capital charges. You will have to go to Maidstone."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a patient goes to his GP, and he tells him that he needs a hernia operation, the determining factor in where he goes for the operation will be not where it is most convenient for him, or where his GP thinks treatment might be best, but his address. The GP will know where the contract for that service has been placed and if the patient's address is within the hospital's area, that is where he will go. The decision about where treatment will be given will not be taken by the GP or the DHA managers acting in the patient's interests. Instead, it will have been taken by the DHA manager before the patient has even the first twinge of symptoms. The straitjacket of the contract will be applied long beforehand. Having diagnosed the problem, the doctor will look at the VDU to find the patient's address and will then know where the patient has to go, on the basis of the DHA having negotiated a contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did not dream up the system all by themselves. It operates in America and is called a health maintenance organisation. A group of people live in an area that is equivalent to a DHA area and have a family doctor in the organisation. When the doctor decides that a patient needs to be referred on for treatment, the only place he can send him is wherever the health maintenance organisation has negotiated a contract. Doctors who work in health maintenance organisations say that the managers of the organisation do not listen when they tell them where they think treatment is good. The managers send patients to wherever they can get a good financial deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited in Boston a health maintenance organisation whose family doctors were up in arms. They had had a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
contract with Massachusetts general hospital. The managers had been offered a cheaper contract with another hospital that had just opened and was offering a loss leader, and, without consulting the family doctors, had changed the contract, so that patients had to be referred to the new hospital. The doctors were worried that that would undermine quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is how the system will operate for GPs who do not have fund-holding practices. The Government know that the system wil be very unpopular with GPs, who do not want to lose their referral rights. They claim that becoming a fund-holding GP is optional. They say that they will not force a doctor to have a fund-holding practice and that doctors can volunteer. Doctors will opt for fund holding because that will be the only way that they can preserve their right to choose where to send their patients for treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can get an idea of how the contract system of the internal market will work by learning about the Government's little experiment, which they choose to call the "waiting list initiative". It is an experiment with the workings of the internal market. The Independent of 28 December 1989 reported that surgeons at a world famous orthopaedic hospital in Shropshire had been told to send their patients on round trips of anything up to 200 miles for treatment at three West Midlands hospitals while they themselves were taking in patients from Pembrokeshire 150 miles away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
DHA managers will sit at their desks like business men at the centre of an empire negotiating contracts with a hospital here and a hospital there. One of the working papers says that DHAs should hold back some of their money because they might find end-of-year bargains. That means that there could well be a summer sale of hysterectomies in Birmingham and that information will go through the VDUs. Hon. Members may be surprised by this, but they should read the working papers becuase the DHAs are told not to spend all of their money at the beginning of the year because they might find a good bargain if, for example someone has a surplus for hysterectomy operations somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A doctor could say that a patient needs a hysterectomy and will go to Maidstone for that operation. He could then tap into the VDU and say, "No, you will be going not to Maidstone but to Birmingham, because we have a new contract." That is outlandish and ridiculous but how the system will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady expand upon a couple of points? First, she said that the only requirement when the DHA established a contract would be that it should be "a good deal financially." Why can there not be other reasons whereby the DHA decides that it is a good deal for patients in other ways, such as efficiency of service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Lady said that GPs who were not budget holders would, in essence, be ignored. The hon. Lady ought to know that the Secretary of State made it clear some time ago that the Bill empowers him by regulations, and he has given a commitment to this effect, to instruct DHAs to consult widely with
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
GPs, and that will include present practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that it sound as if the hon. Gentleman will support amendment No. 25, which would write into the contract that quality must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can imagine the consultations that the DHAs managers will have with GPs. In my area, GPs will say that patients prefer to go to King's College hospital because the staff know the local area and can liaise with social workers on discharge, because community nurses know everyone, and because the network is much better, so they would rather carry on sending patients to the hospital. The DHA manager will reply. "Well I know you would but the problems is—this is not my fault—that the capital charges have meant that King's has priced itself out of the market. It has opted out anyway, but I am sorry we are not going to buy a contract from the opted-out King's College hospital because it is just too expensive. We absolutely take into account your views. I have heard what you said, but there you are. If we spend money on King's College hospital we will have to take it away from somewhere else." The Minister knows exactly what sort of consultations will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect the decision is what matters and, at the moment, that decision is in the hands of the patient and the GR Clause 4 will move that decision to the DHA manager.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ann Widdecombe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidstone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found it hard not to rise when the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) was throwing the name of Maidstone around, but realised that it was only illustrative. However, the hon. Lady has just said that the choice of hospital was the patient's. In my experience, that is not true. Many patients in Maidstone who are waiting for operations could obtain them more quickly elsewhere. However, they are not received with open arms by consultants with shorter lists because they are crossing boundaries and money does not come with them. The whole point of the legislation is to expand patients' choice by sending the money with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with that point in answer to the intervention from the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). We do not object to solving the problem by compensating DHAs for the work that they do. The problem with the contract system is that it will restrict choice. At least there is some choice and flexibility for the patient and the GP now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 presents the Government with a dilemma. Through expensive advertising backed by public money, they have said that the Bill will give patients choice. They have also said that we shall have a contract system. If we have choice, we cannot have a contract system because that system will have no point if people can still go where they want. What is the point of the DHA manager negotiating a contract if all the GPs and patients decide to go somewhere else? A contract system means that we have to eliminate choice—otherwise, it has no point. If there is choice, we shall blow a hole in the contract system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's decision on our amendment will show whether there will be either patient choice or the of the NHS contract. If the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
are prepared to allow choice, they have no reason to vote against our amendment which, notwithstanding the contract system, will continue to give the patients and GPs choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 154 deals with the contingency fund. One of the fig leaves that the Secretary of State has used when pretending that there will still be choice within the system is the contingency reserve fund. The White Paper says that every DHA will have a contingency reserve fund. It makes it quite clear that contingency reserve fund for extra contractual referrals is for the patient who has something wrong with him that is so rare that he has not been catered for under the contract system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
It is not. and it was never intended, to put GP or patient choice into the contract system. Therefore, we tabled an amendment to find out how large the contingency fund will be. whether it is simply there to cater for rare conditions not catered for in the contract and whether it will be the place where choice can be exercised. Will the Minister tell us how the contract will work if patients and GPs can choose where they go for treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
