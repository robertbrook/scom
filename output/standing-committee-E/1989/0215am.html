	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. I should like you to make a ruling on two points. First, last week I gave the Minister's private secretary a copy of a chart that my hon. Friends and I wanted the Minister to complete by adding to it the statistics and arrangements for the funding of the Government's proposals—[	<i>Interruption.</i>)</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. There is too much noise. I am unable to hear the hon. Gentleman, which I naturally need to do to understand his point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:You will know, Dame Janet, that last week there was a debate on the funding arrangements for the new provisions, in which I admitted that I did not understand the arrangements. "When I spoke,to hon. Friends and many people outside the Committee I found general ignorance about those financial arrangements. Could the promised chart be given to us today? We need it because next week we shall deal with clause 44, on ringfencing. It is most important that we understand the financial implications of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I understand that the Norfolk ambulance service might be divested in favour of a Norfolk ambulance service trust, despite contrary undertakings given early last year. There is a danger that the ambulance dispute might escalate in Norfolk unless there is a ministerial statement on the matter. Will the Minister make a statement during this morning's sitting to clarify the Norfolk ambulancemen's position, because the public are worried that what is happening in Norfolk is likely to happen in other areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Neither of the matters raised by the hon. Member are within the Chair's jurisdiction. No doubt the Minister will be able to deal with the point raised about the chart at a convenient time. The second matter, although it may be a matter of concern, is not one for the Chair. As the hon. Member knows such matters can be dealt with in the House, by private notice questions and in other ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The chart that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) requested, which we are happy to provide, will certainly be with the Committee for the start of next week. Although it has not been possible to complete the work by today, we shall try hard to make the chart available tomorrow. I confirm that the broad working principles of funding will remain as I outlined them to the Committee on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry to press the point, but if the chart is not given us until the beginning of the first sitting next week we shall not be able to discuss its
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
implications. Why cannot the chart be made available by tomorrow evening? If the financial arrangements are so simple it should take only minutes to draw up the chart and provide the information that we need. I am not wasting the Committee's time; I am making a genuine request. I am sure that the chart will be of use to many people outside, as well as in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's views. All Committee members would like the information, and I shall do my best to make it available to the Committee by tomorrow, or, if possible, by this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. On 25 January I moved an amendment which would have ensured that enrolled nurses had the opportunity to move into first-level nursing. A early-day motion about the matter, signed by hon. Members of all parties, expressed deep anxiety about the lack of resources to enable such training to go ahead. The hon. Members for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) signed the early-day motion, yet they voted against my amendment. Is it in order for the hon. Members to vote against a measure for which they have shown support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 45, line 9, leave out "from time to time" and insert "every three years".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses and amendments that we discuss today will rightly force hon. Members to consider the nuts and bolts of community care—the problems of those who seek to provide care, and, most importantly, of those in our community who are vulnerable, frail and, sadly, detached. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee may mean well, but our discussions are miles away from the problems that people face. In tabling the amendment, our aim is to question the Government about the inconsistencies between the intentions expressed in the White Paper and the proposals in the Bill. There is also a difference between the recommendations of the Griffiths report and the proposals in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.8 of the White Paper states that community care plans should cover a three-year period. There is no ambiguity in that statement. The Bill, however, states that the plans will be reviewed "from time to time". That is vague. What do the Government mean by it? It would be reassuring if they meant more frequently than every three years, but Opposition Members suspect that they do not. I am not trying to score points; I am seeking information, and I am willing to be convinced by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. I ask him to inform the Committee of the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland(Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope that I can persuade the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) to withdraw the amendment. It would introduce into the Bill a rigidity that would create difficulties for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendment to seek assurances from the Government. I think that the White Paper said that the plans will be prepared on a three-year cycle, but subject to annual review. The review will vary according to circumstances, such as new financial information or local developments. Therefore it would be unwise to tie the Government down to a specific period. The Secretary of State will be able to give guidance under the powers contained in the Bill. It would be our intention to ensure that there were annual reviews of care plans, and that they were prepared during the three-year period in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears of the hon. Member for Monklands, West, are unfounded. I share his anxiety that the care plans should be flexible and updated regularly, but it would not be appropriate to have any phrase other than "from time to time" in the Bill. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that that phrase does not mean a time scale longer than that set out in the White Paper. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Section 10.8 of the White Paper reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The community care plans should cover a three-year period and include targets for the development of local authorities' own services as well as details of local authority proposals for purchasing services from the voluntary and private sector; proposals for individual case management; for developing a range of services; and for handling comments and complaints."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that reminder will assist the Minister. The tone of comments have assisted the Committee. Much of what will be said later today will influence the Opposition as we approach Report. I do not want to be difficult about persuading the Government of the importance of joint planning in Scotland, so I shall consider carefully what the Minister has said, and I beg to ask leave to withraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 254, in page 45, line 14, at end insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this, we may take amendment No. 625, in page 45, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'and in any case where as the case may be, modifications or a new plan are prepared, the authority shall include an account of the adequacy of grant from the Secretary of State and its influence on modifications of plans proposed'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Discerning hon. Members will have noticed that the amendments are similar. I can only think that one of the English associations involved with these matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is blaming the English again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:No. indeed; I come to praise the English, not to bury them. A splendid organisation such as the Association of Metropolitan Authorities might have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
so terribly worried about Scotland that it decided to advise the tabling of an amendment, which could be why we have two similar amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to ensure that an authority includes an account of the adequacy of grant in its plan. In many ways that takes us to the heart of the provision of community care and the preparation of community care plans. Much as we encourage the production of such plans, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for authorities to produce them if they do not know what funding and resources will be available. We cannot have a plan unless authorities know that in detail. This is not an argument about ringfencing, as my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr Campbell-Savours) said—that is likely to come next week. It is an argument for closer co-operation and an exchange of information between local authorities and voluntary organisations, users, consumers and carers. We cannot have meaningful community care plans unless people know about the likely resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had the privilege of visiting several local authorities and voluntary organisations and have seen splendid examples of dedication and best practice. To be fair, I have seen that in the public and private sectors. Our argument about co-operation is that the public sector and the voluntary sector cannot plan if they do not know what their budgets will be. No business could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the all-party spirit of the amendments, I am sorry that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is not in his place—he is also a member of another Committee. I think that he would be keen to support our amendments. He would have in mind the views which were expressed by Tayside Conservatives when supporting a Labour motion and which are consistent with the amendments. Councillor Jane Hendry, a Conservative spokeswoman and former social work convener in Tayside, told Community Care that she supported the Labour motion and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While we had reservations about some aspects of this motion, we are at one with the Labour Group in our deep concern about funding.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I believe we would have been labelled uncaring if we had not supported the motion."</p></blockquote>
I know the councillor involved and in my days in the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities I had many good friends in all the political parties in Tayside. I accept that Conservative councillors are worried about social work provision in their region. They share with Labour authorities the fear that in introducing these plans they are building up people's hopes, increasing their expectations and saying to the elderly, the disabled, the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and their carers that there will be assessments and service provisions whereas in their hearts they know that there will not be the money to honour those commitments. As local authority associations in England and Scotland acknowledge, relating long-term community care plans to day-to-day demands will be possible only if the Government address themselves to the essential issue of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Minister and look forward to the sort of sympathetic response that we received on the previous amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) touches on an important point, which is that it is difficult for voluntary organisations to plan under the present regime when a large number of organisations live from year to year. That difficulty is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>983</span>
frequently compounded by the problem that voluntary organisations have in obtaining even the annual budget in time for the forthcoming financial year. Although this is not the responsibility of my hon. Friend the Minister, it is further compounded by the difficulties that have arisen from the operation of the European social fund, which this year changed its timing for providing money. As I have said before, I am interested in community service volunteers. They are now closing down several admirable projects because the European Community will not even make a decision about providing money until June, which is far too late to keep staff in place and projects running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used to work in the voluntary services unit. I am sensitive to Ministers' difficulties with guaranteeing to voluntary organisations, some of which may depend heavily on the quality of the director, a rolling programme of three-year grants because there is no certainty that a voluntary organisation will still exist or be of the same quality as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will say that, as the community care policy increasingly depends upon the co-operation and use of voluntary organisations as agents for care, he is both sensitive to and has proposals for making the forward planning of such voluntary organisations much easier than it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) is a distinguished former pre.sident of COSLA, the organisation which represents local authorities. Over the years, perhaps in contrast to the English and Welsh organisations that represent local government, COSLA has set its face against specific grants for local authorities as a general policy, on the basis that the practice undermines the independence and freedom of local authorities to decide the appropriate provision of resources for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I was a little surprised to see the hon. Gentleman's name attached to the amendment, which seems to cut across the idea of local authorities having the right to decide for themselves the priority which they will give not only to social worker provision but to community care provision within their overall social work budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I studied the amendment with care, but could not understand its purpose. It has not been my experience, certainly in Scotland, that local authorities have had difficulty in communicating to the Secretary of State, perhaps not always fairly, their views on the adequacy of their grant provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is neither necessary nor in line with the kind of approach that local authorities, through COSLA, have taken in Scotland in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe). It is extremely important to give voluntary organisations an opportunity to plan ahead, and to know what is expected of them and what resources they will be provided with. That is the purpose of the care plans, which will spell out in detail the local authorities' intentions. Local authorities will determine the resources which they think appropriate, drawn from the community charge payer and central Government, to meet their responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>984</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman wants to replace it with a roof tax. No doubt, given the narrowness of the tax base, the opportunities for finding resources for that purpose will be even more limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will reassure my hon. Friend and that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Member for Mid-Rent (Mr. Rowe) for underlining the point that community care is not a vague concept that can be left with one group, be it the Government, local government or voluntary bodies. Adequate community care involves communities in every sense: decisions are taken by central Government and local government decide priorities. As the hon. Gentleman reminded the Committee, it also involves an enormous input by voluntary organisations, such as the Spastics Society, the Salvation Army and MENCAP. Those organisations do their utmost to assist in the provision of community care because they know that there are enormous problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was touched by the Minister's reference to COSLA and to my period as president. I can reassure him on two points. First, COSLA supports the amendment. Secondly, although I shall not anticipate the argument about ringfencing, COSLA, along with every local authority of which I know, strongly supports ringfencing. I accept unreservedly that that is a change from the previous postures of many of those organisations, but the challenges in facing the problems in community care have led to the grudging acceptance that we shall not get community care right, achieve the Griffiths objectives and avoid duplication and waste unless there is ringfencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the amendment, it is not unreasonable to turn to the Minister's first concern. My views are consistent with those that I held when I was president of COSLA. The Minister should not worry. If the amendment is accepted and authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall include an account of the adequacy of grant", it is simply a development of the practice in which I participated as vice-president and president of COSLA.</p></blockquote>
The rate support grant settlement is discussed on the same day as the Government's announcement—there is a statutory obligation to do so—and there is a long consultation with COSLA. I do not know whether the Minister has ever been present at those discussions—I ceased to be president shortly after the Conservative party took office—but he may be aware that the policy committee of COSLA, advised by various groups such as those on finance, social work and education, considers in great detail with the Secretary of State the precise guidelines in each of those sectors. If local authorities find that new legislation— for example, the Children Act 1989—adds to their obligations, they are bound to draw it to the attention of the Secretary of State and his advisers, and they do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing new in the social work advisers and the directors of finance pointing out to the Secretary of State that if the Government are serious about joint planning, they should tell us what they intend to do by way of providing resources. From my experience of the days of the late Willie Ross, of Bruce Millan, when he was Secretary of State for Scotland and of the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), the present Secretary of State for Scotland, I know that there would be nothing new in the Secretary of State and his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>985</span>
advisers spelling out what the guidelines mean. There would be nothing new or offensive to COSLA in that. The social work committees in the Strathclyde, Lothian and Tayside regions will not complain if the Government say, "Let us have community care plans" and then say, "We have taken them into account in our allocation for social work provision." What would be unacceptable, even from the Government's viewpoint, would be letting local authorities struggle to prepare community care plans when they have no idea of the amount of finance that the Government will make available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman I found his comments unconvincing. It is important to return to these issues on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Government amendments Nos. 685 and 686.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In many respects, this group of amendments gets to the heart of our interpretation of community care. In the absence of the clarification which most of the amendments seek, there is considerable doubt in the minds of many people—not just consumers, whose interests should be foremost in our deliberations—about what the Government mean by community care. If they mean closing hospitals or wards in hospitals and sending people out into the community without arrangements for their welfare, they are destroying the concept as we understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition, in common with every voluntary organisation and the local authority associations—and, indeed, the relevant trade unions, especially the National Union of Public Employees and the Confederation of Health Service Employees, as my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) can confirm— are working extremely hard to preach the doctrine of genuine community care, if only because, in recent years, it has, in practice, been discredited. Some of our amendments allow the Government an opportunity to retrieve the position by making much their definition clearer. We were in no doubt about the facts that emerged in the report of the Public Accounts Committee and in the Griffiths analysis, even though we did not agree with all of Griffiths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 299 replaces the phrase "shall consult" with "shall reach agreements with". We endeavoured to embrace the Griffiths recommendations. It is not sufficient to consult and leave it at that. In Scotland, the evidence is that there has not been sufficient consultation when matters have been left to the Government. Community care simply does not work unless there is meaningful agreement in advance. No doubt, Griffiths had that in mind when recommending agreement rather than consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment attempts to assist the Government in what they say are their objectives. Paragraph 10.17 of the White Paper states;
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be a need for planning agreements"—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>not consultation, discussions or chit-chat—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"between local authorities and Health Boards setting out shared assumptions and objectives as the basis of the community care plans of the Health Boards and the local authorities."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>That seemed to be the Government's objective, in the White Paper at least, but it has not been matched—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>987</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is not correct, perhaps the Minister will intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing the local authorities' care plans. When care plans have been established, their implementation can be subject to agreements between local authorities, voluntary organisations and health boards. The hon. Gentleman seems to have gone off at a tangent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister has read the amendments, because they deal with the preparation and the implementation of plans. It saddens me that in that intervention the Minister has confirmed our worries about the vagueness of the Government's approach. We are trying to pin the Government down on detail, and if the Minister will not address himself even to the detail of the amendments, we are in great difficulty. We are indeed talking about agreements involving the local authorities and the health boards as well as the voluntary organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that we are not discussing care plans. Clause 46 is about local authority plans for community services, and amendment No. 299 would omit "shall consult" and insert "shall reach agreements with". The amendment requires local authorities to have reached agreement with, rather than have consulted with, the bodies in drawing up their care plans. That is entirely different from putting into practice the care plans once they have been published, and are subject to consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister looks at the later amendments, he will see that the two relate. He does not seem to have grasped the point. I do not say this disparagingly, because I know that he is not the Minister responsible for social services in Scotland and that that Minister has to be on another Committee, but perhaps if we take it slowly, the Minister will understand precisely what we are trying to convince him of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's intervention was nevertheless helpful, because in the amendments we are arguing that community care plans should not be left exclusively with the health authorities or exclusively with the local authorities. As the Griffiths report said repeatedly, it would not work. For example, the health boards may give priority to the mentally ill—there is every incentive to do so, because plans for the mentally ill are ring-fenced, as we know—whereas the local authorities may set a completely different priority, conflicting with the health authorities. They may choose the physically disabled or mentally handicapped, for example. The Government's attitude is vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the Minister's attention an excellent document on joint planning in Scotland, which is addressed by the amendments. It was produced by the Care in the Community Scottish working group, and I trust that the Minister will not suggest that it does not know what it is talking about. The pamphlet is entitled "Stop…Start…Stutter", and the study is of joint planning as it supposed to be in practice in Scotland. The evidence is extremely worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make my point simply, on page 12 of the document there is a cartoon illustrating the role of the health authorities and the local authorities and their failure to get together. It shows two people taking part in a race. Their ankles are tied together, they are blindfold and they are moving in opposite directions; they do not know where
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
they are heading. Standing by them is a reporter with a notebook asking, "Why are you making no progress?" The reason for lack of progress in community care in Scotland is obvious: all the people involved are pulling in opposite directions because there are no local agreements or consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary were to accept the amendment, that would greatly increase his popularity in Scotland. I am trying to help, and I am sure he would agree that he needs more help than he has been given hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue in favour of the amendments with great confidence, not only on behalf of the Scottish local authorities, but on behalf of the voluntary organisations and consumers. Amendment No. 776, standing in the name of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), deals with voluntary organisations and is very welcome, but in amendment No. 731 there is a genuine endeavour by Opposition Members to realise that community care does not begin and end with the Health Service, important though it is. Hon. Members as both sides are aware that 90 per cent, of people have problems that we must tackle, whether connected with housing need, transport, leisure or recreation—anything that affects the quality of life. That is our reason for tabling amendment No. 731, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will give it serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had it been possible to achieve consensus in the Committee, I am sure that the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and his hon. Friends could have tabled amendments other than amendment No. 461 .We accept the mixed economy unreservedly, but we do not appear to have persuaded the hon. Member for Pembroke, because his amendment relates exclusively to private organisations. That is fair enough but what kind of philosophy seeks consultation exclusively with the private sector and excludes the local authorities responsible for providing the service, as well as voluntary organisations, advocates, consumers and users—the very people for whom community care must have some meaning? If division is being created, it is not being created by Opposition Members. So I hope that the Minister will dissociate himself from amendment No. 461 and attempt to solve the comprehensive problems that we highlight in our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not undertand what the hon. Gentleman is talking about. The purpose of my amendment is to add another group to the list of those that are to be consulted; I am not seeking to remove any of the bodies already covered by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman is right to say that he is adding a group, but his case would have been more convincing if he had tabled amendments supporting the role of the voluntary organisations, carers and public bodies, all of which are desperately anxious that local plans for community care should have some meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to finish my comments but wish briefly to speak to amendment No. 734. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr Cook) cannot be with us, for reasons which we understand. My hon. Friend has some reservations about what might be perceived as the role of the Secretary of State in relation to this amendment. Given the Minister's earlier intervention, I should make it clear that no one on the Opposition Benches wishes to give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>989</span>
the Secretary of State, especially the present Secretary of State for Scotland, more powers than it is reasonable to give him. We do not seek to do that. In Scotland, we are making a plea for the involvement—[	<i>Interruption</i>] I am sorry that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland seems to mock his right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland; there are many who think that he is undermining his right hon. and learned Friend. To snigger when the Secretary of State for Scotland is mentioned will not do even the hon. Gentleman's career that much good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman must not misrepresent the expression on my face. I was smiling because in our debate on the previous amendment the hon. Gentleman argued for reducing local authority discretion whereas he now argues for increasing the powers of the Secretary of State. The view taken by his hon. Friends during our proceedings to date has been that too many powers are being given to the Secretary of State. I was amused at the hon. Gentleman's discomfort in standing on his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Minister was as convincing in that reply as he always is. I leave it to Members to reach their own conclusions. It is sad that we have no television cameras present because if we had, the Secretary of State for Scotland could see what the Minister really thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:And what he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Yes, and what he did. Despite his policies, the Secretary of State for Scotland is no fool. I need not give him advice on what the Minister is up to in that relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accused me of wishing to diminish the role of local authorities; quite the reverse is so. Not one word in my remarks was about reducing the role of local authorities. Had I argued that their role should be reduced, I could not tell the Committee, as I do, that they support our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to do two things. I want to encourage the Minister to accept that joint planning in Scotland is a shambles and to encourage him to bring together everyone involved so that we may reach the level of joint planning—inadequate though it may be—already reached in England and Wales. He should accept that because the Secretary of State for Scotland appears to show a lack of awareness of the problems of joint planning in Scotland, he should at least be given information about decisions that are being taken. I accept that there are better ways in which to proceed. I should prefer a Scottish Assembly to be set up to deal with such matters in detail and a Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, which the Minister resists. In the absence of that, as the Secretary of State for Scotland is at least entitled to reply to questions in the House, it might be helpful to consider the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 301 deals with co-ordination and joint planning. The Government have not come clean. They have not even implemented in Scotland the section of the National Health Service (Amendment) Act 1986 that deals with joint planning, introduced only under great pressure following the passage of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. The Government are ignoring the views of local authorities and
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
voluntary organisations. They published a circular in 1985, which meant nothing and since then, they have refused to monitor the lack of co-ordination in joint planning. We give them the opportunity to put that right by accepting amendment No. 301.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, in common with our other amendments, is consistent with the commitment that the Government say they have made to the consumer. The theme of our amendments and approach to these matters is that the elderly, the frail, the vulnerable, the physically and mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and their carers should have their views, needs and assessments taken fully into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Government are not entirely to blame if best practice applies to some areas and not to others and neglect is introduced in some areas but not in others. Local plans should relate to such matters. But local plans cannot have meaning unless Parliament knows, through the Secretary of State for Scotland, what is or is not happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given our commitment to genuine consumerism in social services and community care, I commend our amendments to the Committee. Despite his interventions, I hope that the Minister will be more constructive than he has been so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope not to detain the Committee, but wish to speak to my amendment No. 461. First, I refer briefly to amendment No. 299 moved by the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke), which would be far too restrictive. Moreover, it appears from the hon. Gentleman's passing comments on my amendment, that he misunderstands the purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would make it impossible for a local authority to proceed unless it received complete agreement from all those who were consulted. Clearly, that is nonsense. If authorities consult a wide range of people, there may well be different views. How on earth can a local authority be expected to proceed when it cannot get agreement from bodies with different views? It is a strange suggestion. That is a fairly basic objection to amendment No. 299.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, as drafted, requires authorities to consult. That is as far as it can go if, in the end, there is to be some action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with my amendment No. 461, the hon. Member for Monklands, West appears again not to have read the clause. My amendment would add "private health organisations" to the clause. It does not take anything away from all those others to be consulted. The hon. Gentleman will see from the clause that health boards and voluntary bodies will be consulted. There was no need to table an amendment to include them in the clause because they are already there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:All the organisations that we included in amendments for consultation purposes—for example, housing authorities and bodies and voluntary housing organisations—are organisations for which the hon. Gentleman did not consider it appropriate to table amendments. He seemed only to be interested in private hospitals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>991</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman is wrong. I refer him to subsection (3)(b) in the proposed new section 5A, which refers to voluntary bodies. That would include the voluntary housing movement and organisations with an interest in community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to firm up the clause and to include an important group of people in the provision of private health and community care that has been missed out. The Bill places a heavy responsibility on local authorities to identify the need for social and nursing care among their populations. The proposed new section 5A would extend that responsibility to the preparation of plans showing how to meet those responsibilities. There can be no doubt that the development of plans capable of effective implementation depends on the willing co-operation of the parties involved. Wide-ranging consultation, as required by subsection (3), will be important. But while the clause nominates representatives to voluntary bodies who provide community care services, it omits similar consultations with representatives of the private sector. In Scotland, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, the independent sector, though private and voluntary, provides a high proportion of residential nursing home care. The number of independent care homes is greater than the number of local authority care homes. Generally, however, private homes are smaller than local authority homes, so the number of places and residents is slightly lower. For nursing care, the number of independent sector places is about half the number of NHS long-stay geriatric and psycho-geriatric beds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, the number of elderly people who require care in residential or nursing care homes will increase. No matter how good domiciliary care becomes, a proportion of elderly people will reach a level of dependency and need care in a home. Additional places in new homes will be needed and most are likely to be supplied by the independent private home owners. It is therefore essential to involve representatives of private health care organisations in the development of local planning. They will need to know the local authority's projected demand so that they can prepare their own plans to meet the inevitable increase in need for residential and nursing care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is modest: it is in line with the Government's thinking on wide-ranging provision for private and public sector community care. I hope that it will be accepted and that a body which provides nearly half the places and does a major part of the work in this sector will be consulted about important plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I shall speak to Government amendment No. 684. I confess that so far I have not paid close enough attention to the clauses that relate to Scotland. However, I took the precaution of reading the summary of clause 46 in the preamble to the Bill, which states that it makes provision for Scotland similar to that in clause 41, the relevant English clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, several hon. Members on both sides of the Committee made powerful speeches supporting the inclusion in the Bill of the obligation to consult voluntary organisations. We explained that there was a resource there, and that it was consistent with the thrust of the Bill. I spoke to an amendment that required consultation with housing authorites and associations to ensure that they were not left out of the process. There was a long debate and at the end of it my hon. Friend the Minister for Health
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
made a speech so powerful that it persuaded me to withdraw the amendment. The Minister argued that it was redundant, that it was not necessary to clutter up the statute book and that what really mattered was that local authorities should consult. But what so I see in clause 46 but the spirit of the amendment. It states: "the authority shall consult … persons appearing to the authority to be representative of voluntary bodies providing community care services in their area".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Scottish members of the Committee can assure the hon. Gentleman that the reason for the proposal is that the Scottish Minister with responsibility for health matters is philosophically more wet than the Minister for Health south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am anxious, and so, I am sure, is the hon. Gentleman, to hear the genuine reason for the apparently differential treatment. Why should something that on Tuesday was redundant and unnecessary on Thursday be Government policy? Not only are voluntary bodies already in the Bill, but Government amendment No. 684 writes in voluntary housing agencies. I tabled an amendment on Tuesday that would have included voluntary housing agencies. A powerful speech was made—it was too powerful for me—and I made what, in retrospect, was the erroneous decision not to press my amendment to a Division. Had I so pressed it, my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for Scotland would have been obliged to vote with me, because he had tabled an identical amendment to the Scottish clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is going on? Why are English Ministers unable to persuade the Government to include in the Bill provisions that the Scottish Office Minister has already written in? Is it a deficiency in our eloquence? What is going wrong? Why can we not have the equivalent of Government amendment No. 684 to clause 41?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I begin by giving my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for Scotland some advice: he would be unwise, no matter how moderate the tone and how gentle the approach, to take any advice from the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) on how to further his career, no matter whether he stands on his head or his feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of my hon. Friend the Minister for Tayside, North (Mr. Waller), I shall speak to amendments Nos. 776 and 777.1 was asked to do so by the Council for Voluntary Organisations in Scotland. I fear that that organisation remembered the fact that for over a decade I was deeply involved in voluntary organisations in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One purpose of the amendments is to tease out from my hon. Friend the Minister whether we should be content that local authorities have total discretion when deciding which voluntary organisations to consult. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons appearing to the authority to be representative of voluntary bodies".</p></blockquote>
I understand that it is extremely difficult for local authorities to consult every self appointed so called voluntary organisation representatve. But often even the best local authorities get set into a pattern of consulting the voluntary organisations that they have always consulted. New voluntary organisations sometimes appear rather strident and tiresome because they have to kick and bully the statutory services into paying attention to them. A hard
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0889">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
pressed local authority may feel that it cannot be bothered with that particular organisation. Therefore I want the Minister's assurance that he will consider carefully the wording of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee what an enormous proportion of care in the community is provided by voluntary organisations in Scotland. They care for 25 per cent. of elderly people in residential homes and provide nearly all the registered residental accommodation for physically handicapped people and over 50 per cent. of the residential accommodation for mentally handicapped people. They provide 35 per cent. of the residential accommodation for mentally ill people, 36 per cent. of the places in day care centres for the physically handicapped, and 70 per cent. of places in day care centres for multiply handicapped people. They are responsible for 60 per cent. of the places in day care centres for mentally ill people and 47 per cent. of places in day centres for elderly people. That is a substantial contribution to the care of vulnerable groups and I have no doubt that it will grow in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong and colourable argument—it applies especially in Scotland unless it has changed out of all recognition since I lived there—that the voluntary organisations often constitute as good a way of getting the opinions of users of the services as anything that is easy to call into being. One of the amendments seeks that the voice of the consumer should be heard through voluntary organisations in the consultations carried out by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but amendment No. 777 deals with voluntary organisations that represent the user, not necessarily those that provide services. It would be useful if he could emphasise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for emphasising that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by asking my hon. Friend the Minister to reassure us on the matter, or even accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am moved or inspired to speak briefly by the ringing contribution from the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), who has flushed out the Scottish health Minister as being both politically wet and an arch-devolutionist, in that he is doing his own thing at the Scottish home and health Department quite independently of what is happening at the Department of Health in Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that new-found knowledge, it is a pity that the hon. Gentleman did not press his amendment to a vote earlier in the week. Perhaps it is just that he is a pushover for a pretty face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Before the hon. Gentleman completely destroys the Minister's reputation in Scotland—not that that would be difficult—I should point out that the Under Secretary of State for Scotland who is present is not the relevant Minister for this particular part of the Bill. It is the other Under Secretary, the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), and he is serving on another Committee. Perhaps this is his amendment, not the Minister's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That could explain it. I am not sure whether it has been queried before, but that raises the question of whether the Scottish health Minister, who on these issues is technically not the person with ministerial
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
accountability in the sense that they perhaps fall under the remit of education and social work, will have leeway from his ministerial friend to grant concessions to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak to amendments Nos. 731 and 732, and in doing so, underscore what the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) said. There is a consultation requirement in the Bill, but the scope of the consultation should surely extend beyond the health boards and the voluntary organisations directly involved in the provision of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout our proceedings, the Committee has been dogged by the fact that so much is running on ministerial assurance. We move innocuous amendments which do not strike philosophically at the purpose of the Bill, and we are told that they are not necessary because Ministers in Scotland, England and, presumably, Wales want there to be consultation, full involvement, reports, proper assessment and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, all that we have are ministerial assurances to that effect and, as everyone knows, if legislation is subjected to legal scrutiny outside the House—in a court of law, for example—ministerial assurances given on the Floor of the House, at the Dispatch Box or in Committee, are not worth the paper they are written on. That is why I wonder if there is not some merit in writing into the Bill from time to time what hon. Members on both sides of the Committee think should happen and what Ministers say must happen and intend to happen under certain parts of the Bill. I do not see the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's argument. Does he accept that there is a case for not setting the arrangements in concrete, specifying consultations too precisely, for example? Does he also accept that as community care develops, there may be completely different structures? Finally, does he accept that writing into the Bill a series of legal obligations may generate much vexatious litigation, which would help neither the clients of community care not the people who deliver it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I can respond to the first and third points, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman will find an opportunity at some stage to say what he means by different structures. I agree that there should be flexibility and that we do not want to make this aspect of social policy subject to lengthy litigations in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is an element of carrot and stick with the health authorities, the local authorities or whoever it might be. The goods ones will tend to do what members of the Committee in pious, hopeful phrases say that they want them to do, but the bad ones will not, unless there is an obligation in law on them to do so. Even then, of course, some of the bad ones will not and they will end up in the courts, as they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I just wonder why a little more leeway is not granted by the Government about embodying in the Bill aspects of consultation on Scottish issues. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton made a particularly powerful point in that respect, but he was persuaded, as he politely and generously put it—I would not rate persuasion as one of the strong characteristics of the Minister for Health from what I have heard so far in committee—not to pursue it.

I hope that the principles underlying amendments Nos. 731 and 732 on general co-ordination will commend themselves to the born-again, devolutionist, wet Scottish health Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:This has turned into a much more interesting debate than I had expected. I should have thought that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) were well aware of the differences in legislation north and south of the border and the substantial differences in our approach to community care and joint planning. There are also differences in the structure of health boards and authorities, and it should not surprise them that there are differences in legislation. If there were not, the Bill would not have to deal with Scotland separately, and any suggestion that there is a new commitment to devolution because our legislation is different is extraordinary, all the more so as it comes so late in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject the notion that that there are differences of approach between myself and my hon. Friend the Minister for Health. There is an entirely plausible explanation for Government amendment No. 684 taking a different line from the debate in which my hon. Friend took part. It is perfectly clear that my hon. Friend has more confidence in local authorities in England than I have in local authorities in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In that case, perhaps the Minister will explain why the Secretary of State for Scotland has no intention of poll tax capping any local authority in Scotland, whereas 100 local authorities in England are about to be poll tax capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of a series of amendments to the Bill has been to write in requirements for consultation. The Government have rightly said that it is not necessary to write into the Bill that which would be common sense and can be covered by regulation, guidance or, ultimately, direction, and there are powers to provide all three. In England, the view has been taken that local authorities can be relied upon to consult with groups and use their judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a confession to make: I listened to the debate with an open mind, and I was prepared to withdraw amendment No. 684. That may be difficult now that I have heard the speech of my hon. Friend for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), and I doubt whether he would accept my reasons for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) for speaking to the amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who has asked me to say that he is unable to
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
be here today because he has put on his Wellingtons and is touring flood damage in his constituency, in the company of my noble Friend Lord Sanderson of Bowden. I know that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) will have every sympathy with my hon. Friends concern about the damage that has occurred in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North and that moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) would extend the list of groups and bodies that should be consulted, as does Government amendment No. 684. The difficulty with the amendments, including the Government amendment, is that the duty that they would impose on local authorities does not make much sense in terms of time and resources. On the other hand, it is important to have a process for consulting these bodies, and Government amendment No. 684 meets the wishes of my hon. Friends the Members for Pembroke and for Tayside, North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:May I put a couple of technical questions to the Minister about amendment No. 684? First, why does it not include islands councils, which are also housing authorities? Secondly, why does it not mention Scottish Homes? Scottish homes is not, of course, a voluntary housing organisation, but as a statutory housing organisation why is it not included in the list of housing authorities that should be consulted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. One of the difficulties of including lists of organisations in the Bill is that there are always people whose names do not appear on the list and who should be consulted about the national view, or about the local view. In effect, island authorities would be consulting themselves. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that he has discovered a loophole in our thinking, he may as well ask why we have not included education authorities. There is no necessity to put into the Bill a statutory duty for local authorities to consult themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I find that astonishing, because the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 contains an obligation on the community charge registration officer to consult the electoral registration officer about the registers. In fact, they are the same person and so are consulting themselves, yet here the Minister says that separate parts of a local authority cannot consult other parts. Moreover, there ought to be an obligation to consult education authorities, because there is no obligation to do so at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman is muddled. He says that the community charge registration officer and the electoral registration officer are the same person, so it was wrong that there should be a duty to consult. Here we are dealing with functions. The authority that is responsible for community care is also the authority that is responsible for education and, in the case of island councils, the one that is responsible for housing. To write into legislation a duty to consult oneself is taking a lack of confidence in local authorities to an extreme that even I would not consider. Surely we can rely on local authorities to talk to themselves if not to people outside. That is why Government amendment No. 684 is on the amendment paper. I hope that I have persuaded my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>997</span>
Pembroke that his sensible points about consulting and involving the private sector will be met and that we shall expect local authorities to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon. Friend. In view of what he has said I do not intend to press amendment No. 461, which is adequately covered by amendment No. 684.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Amendment No. 299 and the speech of the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) put forward the extraordinary idea that in order to achieve agreement on the implementation of care plans, which is desirable, local authorities should be under a duty to reach agreement with the bodies that they are obliged to consult. The hon. Gentleman justified the amendment on the somewhat unfair grounds that little progress had been made because people were unable to reach agreement. Writing into the Bill a requirement that progress could be made only when agreement was reached would ensure that nothing would happen, which was what the hon. Gentleman said would be the case if we did not accept the amendment. The argument that independent bodies should be required to reach agreement with one other while remaining independent bodies with their own duties is a contradiction in terms. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman sought to argue it, especially using the flimsy argument that the Government did not understand their own Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will have responsibilities in this area. It will be for them to draw up their care plans. It will be for them to reach planning agreements with the appropriate bodies, whether voluntary bodies, health authorities or private sector bodies, to ensure that their care plans are brought into effect. I endorse the view that is held across the Committee that several bodies should be consulted on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend amendment No. 684 to the Committee. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke for not seeking to press his amendment. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North is content with our proposals and I hope that the hon. Member for Monklands, West will feel able to withdraw amendment No. 299 and not press the others standing in the names of his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listended to the Under-Secretary with enormous interest and I am thinking of tabling on amendment to oblige the Scottish Office to consult the Department of Health in drafting plans for legislation on community care. I understand that there has to be separate Scottish legislation, which is why there is a separate Scottish 46. But we are not talking about the framework; we are talking about policy. The reason that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave was so unconvincing that even he could not believe it. He argued that there was such an affinity between the 'Scottish Office and Scottish local authorities that the clause was redundant, but that affinity was not paralleled in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I woke up this morning to the ringing tones of my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities being interviewed on the 	<i>"Today"</i> programme. He berated several English local authorities, the number as yet unspecified, for not complying with Government policy by setting a higher community charge than the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
thought necessary. We all know that the delay on the decision on Griffiths was due to the lack of confidence of British Ministers in English local authorities. For the Under-Secretary to give that as the reason for the obligation to consult in Scotland but not in England was singularly unconvincing. We could have accepted the proposal more readily if there were no obligation to consult in Scotland. I am not convinced that that obligation should be written into the clauses covering Scotland if it does not need to be included in the clauses applying to England. The obligation should apply either to both countries or to neither. The present proposal is unsatisfactory and indefensible. On Tuesday, the oratory of my hon. Friend the Minister for Health was so powerful that if I were to be consistent I should have to vote against amendment No. 684.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been several disappointments during the debate; some have been minor and some more important. The first minor one occured when the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) said that the Under-Secretary should not listen to my advice on his future career. The Under-Secretary should be worried, however by the advice that the hon. Member for Mid-Kent has given to his right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath), because I might meet with even greater success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that hon. Members will hesitate to take the advice of Ministers when they reflect that the present Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, when he was involved with the Water Bill, advised poeple to drink Perrier water. That is consistent with the Government's standard of advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary will be pleased to hear that we do not seek to oppose amendment No. 684 which deals with housing. He should not expect Opposition Members to be jubilant, however because it is a tiny-weeny amendment which does not comprehensively embrace housing. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, it does not deal with Scottish homes. The Minister should consider our amendments which do so, especially amendment No. 731.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Minister for Health knows more about community care than the Under-Secretary does, as it is not his normal responsibility. But if he listened to the debate more carefully—I gave him a better hearing than he is giving me—he would be amazed at the discoveries that he would make. He said that he found it extraordinary that we would talk of agreements, which was an opinion echoed by the honourable Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), but there is nothing extraordinary about having agreements. Remarkably, the Opposition appear to support the White Paper and the Government's policies more than the Under-Secretary does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to page 42 of the White Paper where, in response to the Griffiths report's complaints about fragmentation and the lack of consultation and agreement, the Government said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Social service authorities, as well as health authorities, family practitioner committees and housing authorities, will be expected to ensure that the community care plans complement each other and do not conflict."</p></blockquote>
That is my answer to the hon. Member for Pembroke, who asked how there could be agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0892">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
Scottish community care is a complete shambles, because agreement cannot be reached without discussion, and without the Secretary of State addressing himself to the problem. In practice, that means the rejection for the main thrust of the Griffiths report. On page 8 the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is only limited evidence of systematic planning to ensure resources are targeted at the areas of greatest need. Without such planning, there is a danger that the concentration on child care duties and responsibilities which are more explicitly stated in legislation and attract more political and public attention may result in low priority being given to community care."</p></blockquote>
That is a splendid description of community care in practice in Scotland. I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted our criticism, or taken the opportunity that the amendments provide to make the Bill consistent with the Griffiths report and the White Paper. That shows the Government's attitude to joint planning in Scotland. The truth is that they do not like it, just as they do not like community or consumer involvement. Had the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr Walker) been present this morning, we might have heard what the Government think about the involvement of voluntary organisations. I am sorry that he was absent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman has been talking nonsense. If local authorities were required to reach agreement with the bodies that they had to consult, and they were unable to do so, the care plans would not be produced and there would be no progress. The amendment would result in deadlock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is astonishing that such an intervention should come from the Under-Secretary, especially as he reminded me earlier that I was the president of COSLA. Is he suggesting that the Government reached agreement with COSLA on rate or housing support grants, or on anything else? They did not, but it still carried out its responsibilities. When the bodies involved—including the voluntary bodies and the consumers—draw up plans together, they are capable of showing where they cannot reach agreement. Surely even the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland can interpret what it means when agreement cannot be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Under-Secretary argued against the amendment. He may not realise that in doing so he argued against the existing system in England and Wales. If the system does not work, why are there no amendments to remove the provisions applying to England and Wales? It does work, as the Minister knows, though not to everybody's full satisfaction. He need not involve the Committee in nit-picking. There are more serious issues than those addressed so far by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Did the hon. Gentleman say that local authorities in England and Wales were required to reach agreement with outside bodies in their care plans? I am sure that he did not mean to mislead the Committee, but if he said that he was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am saying that consultations on joint planning in England and Wales lead to agreement on many matters. If the Minister is not aware of that, he should check it. There is no reason why the commonsense approach that exists in England and Wales, which my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs Mahon) confirms, cannot apply to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
I am sorry that the Under-Secretary feels unable to support amendment No. 731. I do not make the absurd claim that an honourable Member talks nonsense merely because he or she does not agree with me. I think that I understand the Minister's narrow view. I think that he is wrong, but I do not say that he is talking nonsense. I disagree with his argument, and think that the matter should be discussed rationally. If I am talking nonsense today, then so too is almost every voluntary organisation in Scotland. Would not it be amazing if they, the local authorities, the carers, the consumers and I were wrong, yet the Under-Secretary—who is not even the Under-Secretary of State for Social Services—were right?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment should receive the support of Committee meetings. I am not persuaded by the Minister's arguments on other amendments, but I shall not press them because there may be opportunities to return to them on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 731 we go out of our way to embrace the objectives of the Government's White Paper, to involve local authorities and to deal with housing, Scottish homes, education, and voluntary bodies. The hon. Member for Pembroke might be interested to know that we even involved the private sector, in proposed new paragraph (g). What could be more comprehensive than that? The amendment involves everybody connected with policy formulation in the provision of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary was wrong to say that community care was simply a matter for social work authorities, Theirs is an important involvement, but education is important as well. For community care and assessments to mean anything, people with special needs should be entitled to go on to further education once they have left their special schools, and people with physical disabilities should also have access to further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the evidence, the Government have failed tragically to take on board the Griffiths analysis, or even the message of their own White Paper. The Opposition have offered them considerable help this morning with amendment No. 731.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 42 is central to the Bill. It deals with the vital question of assessment. It is the linchpin of the hopes which we all have for the new community care system, and it is inevitably a source of some anxiety. It would be wholly possible, I think, to devise such an elaborate and expensive system of assessing everyone who was deemed by anyone to have any sort of vulnerability that the entire staff and substantial economic resources of a local authority could be devoted to the last leaving no resources for the provision of the care which is the whole purpose of having the assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be possible to have such a rigid or perfunctory system of assessment that the person being assessed would feel wholly dissatisfied, and the services with which he was provided would be inadequate. Within that spectrum, a sensible and satisfactory system has to be devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 273 is to prevent the decision of whether to assess someone being left wholly to the discretion of the local authority. We must remember that assessment becomes the key which unlocks the services which people need. Many of those assessments, if they are properly done by a social services department in which people have built up trust, will be fairly limited. There is no need for a massive, bureaucratic, cumbersome assessment process for someone who in the early stages of a condition, or a temporary condition, only requires an additional rail in the bathroom or something of that sort.

On the other hand, people's future is often determined by the accident of who first comes across their need. If it is a general practitioner, they often get sucked into a health provision, a health assessment and a health orientation. If it is a neighbour, they may come across quite unsuitable advice. Many examples have come to the attention of Committee members—some of them have been quoted already—of people who have had a careful assessment by an occupational therapist, following which immensely expensive equipment has been provided for them in their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1003</span>
houses—yet all they needed was something fairly simple. The Bill cannot always prevent that happening, but one hopes that having a single key to the cupboard of resources will minimise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a great mistake if the local authority were the only corporate body which could ask for an assessment. There will be people, or their neighbours, or their carers, who will actually want an assessment. The amendment seeks to ensure that there will be assessment, if not wholly on demand, at any rate when demand is reasonable. Some unfortunate people, as we all know, get an idee fixe that what they need is a particular form of support in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that local councils, when seeking to modify people's property, have over the years often persuaded people to have expensive modifications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:There is always that danger, and the thrust of many of our interventions in the debate has been towards listening to the clients themselves. They often know—or seem to know—much better than the professionals what they need, although the professionals should have a much more up-to-date view of what is available. People often ask for something which is becoming old-fashioned and less effective than something modern. However, I take my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, some people get an 	<i>idée fixe</i> about what they need, and if they are not given it, they will go on seeking it. The amendment does not seek to impose upon a local authority an obligation to provide unnecessary assessments, but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister for Health to tell us that either the carer or the individual will be able to ask for an assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 274 goes a stage further. It says that there is no point in an assessment which states that the individual concerned requires a certain kind of service if there is no obligation on the local authority to provide that service. It is equally meaningless and enormously frustrating to tell a local authority that in every case it must there and then provide the service for which it has made an assessment. That will result in assessments so cautious, partial and minimal—if, for example, few resources were available in that financial year—it would be worse than nothing. People in the local authority could say that an assessment had been made, but it would be meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A balance is needed, but the Bill leaves it wide open for local authorities to make an assessment and feel no obligation to provide the services that they have assessed as being necessary. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will respond on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) will speak at greater length on amendment No. 500. The aim is for the Bill to take account of the fact that carers should not be forced to go on providing care whether or not they feel able, or want, to do so. That is the essence of the amendment. I shall leave it to my hon. Friend to elaborate on the issue although I shall return to it if I do not feel that he has said enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I refer to amendments Nos. 29,753 and 754. The latter can be referred to as the informal carers amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
Amendment No. 29 deals with the right of people to seek an assessment of their own cases. As it stands, I accept that perhaps too much power has been given to the service providers, including the local authorities. We complain that too often people do not want to be "done unto". The amendment would give people the opportunity to ask for their own assessment. That is a perfectly reasonable request, I hope that the Minister agrees with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to amendments Nos. 753 and 754, we are all concerned about the role of the informal carer. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is not present, but if he told me that I did not know what I was talking about, I might have to agree. Who among us can say that we understand the role performed by informal carers, hour after hour, day after day and month after month? The amendment would give them the right to a proper assessment. That is not unreasonable. It is right to respond to the needs of the person who is cared for, but in many circumstances it is manifestly obvious that there is a problem for the carer, too. In many cases, that problem will become far greater than the problem of the person being cared for. It is not unreasonable that there should be an assessment of the need, for example, for respite care, home help support or occupational therapy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is essentially important for the elderly. As the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys report revealed, many carers are themselves elderly people, pensioners in their 70s looking after people in their 90s. That creates great problems that call for assessment and response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of my earlier remarks, I do not seek to be a spokesman for carers, but it is often possible to identify the simple fact that the needs of carers are sometimes different from, and even in conflict with, the needs of the person being cared for. Those needs cannot be dealt with unless there are adequate assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I complained earlier that the Bill often does not reflect the Griffiths recommendations or the White Paper. The White Paper and, to some extent, the Griffiths report do not go as far in dealing with the needs and rights of carers as the organisations of and for carers would wish. Neither the White Paper nor the Bill places a responsibility on local authorities to assess the needs of carers. Given that community care would collapse if there were not 6 million carers—often the first woman available in the family or the household— that is extremely important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman gives me an opportunity to rectify an omission from my earlier remarks. An element of amendment No. 273 is that allowing an authorised carer to apply for an assessment gives an opportunity for the carers' problems to be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman I agree with him. If the amendment, or something like it, is not accepted, there is evidence that local authorities will not accept their responsibilities. Labour Members would have prefered it if the Griffiths report had said more about carers, but it does contain a special paragraph that I hope will impress the Minister. In the section about families and informal carers, chapter 4.3 of the Griffiths report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The information provided to carers about service availability and how they might be helped with their onerous responsibilities is limited. A failure to give proper levels of support to informal carers not only reduces their own quality of life and that of the relative or friend they care for, but is also potentially inefficient as it can lead to less personally appropriate care being offered."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1005</span>
I emphasise the following sentence which continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Positive action is therefore needed to encourage the delivery of more flexible support, which takes account of how best to support and maintain the role of the informal carer."</p></blockquote>
The operative words are "positive action". The Bill, as drafted, does not meet that request for positive action in response to the needs of informal carers, There were hardly any references to it in the White Paper and there is not one word in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman is being slightly harsh. I refer him to the key objectives in the White paper, the second of which is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure that service providers make practical support for carers a high priority."</p></blockquote>
The White Paper frequently refers to carers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady had waited to hear the next part of my sentence, she would probably have not made that intervention. There is not one word in the Bill about how those commitments can be implemented. If I were a carer I might say that I hear many references from the Government—some might even say a lot of soft-soap—but I hear nothing about a commitment to carers on how their special needs can be assessed. Will the Minister comment on the absence of that commitment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The OPCS survey on disability estimated that two thirds of live-in carers—that is a staggering figure and I am pretty ashamed about not knowing it—receive no help from statutory services. That is a condemnation of our society in terms of mutuality of concern and interest in providing those people with support. Worse still the news that a survey carried out for the National Carers Association revealed that 83 per cent. of carers received no help from professional, family or friends. They are struggling, isolated and alone, trying to cope with often are beyond my imagination and perhaps the imagination of many who have not experienced such difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper and the Bill refer to the training needs of staff, and rightly so. In that respect, the Bill does not go far enough. But is 83 per cent. of carers are coping alone, surely training is needed in occupational therapy, aspects of physiotherapy, lifting, and so on. We have not begun to tackle those needs which carers' organisations rightly remind us we could consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those organisations are right for two reasons, to ask us to consider such important matters. First, the case for social responsibility is unanswerable. Secondly, if the Prime Minister invited Sir Roy Griffiths to report on these matters because she was worried about inefficiency, having been alarmed by the Treasury, there may well be a point to that. If a carer can no longer cope and care because of the absence of support, both he and the person being cared for may end up institutionalised or in hospital or end up in some way having their needs met by the Treasury. Therefore, it makes economic sense to ensure that proper assessments are made. The best people to tell us of their difficulties are the carers themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that, almost without exception, members of the Committee could cite cases in their constituences involving difficulty for carers. Time and again, my hon. Friends have drawn attention to some of those difficulties. I shall refer to one case which is relevant to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1006</span>
amendments. It is known to many members of the Committee and was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) on the floor of the House in debate on community care. By coincidence, my hon. Friend referred to an article written by Maureen Oswin in 	<i>The Independent</i> on 28th June 1989—the same day on which I met Maureen Oswin at a MENCAP launch of an organisation dealing with carers' needs. I hope that Maureen Oswin will forgive me if I say that she was very ordinary yet extraordinary person. Her case may not be unique, but I recommend any honourable Member who has not read the article to do so. The Article was entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Neglected after a job of love—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Maureen Oswin, who gave up work for nearly five years to nurse her dying sister, described how the State has devalued her role."</p></blockquote>
She was a professional person in her 50s, living in a flat near the Royal Marsden hospital in London, and her sister lived in Devon. In 1985, she discovered that her sister had brain cancer, and she decided to give up her career and look after her sister. The Article describes what happened in five years, with the steady deterioration in her sister's health, starting with brain surgery, followed by radiotherapy, and so on, up to the final year, when her sister was blind, wholly paralysed, unable to communicate and therefore needing 24-hour attention. Maureen graphically describes how she, as the carer, was confined to the household, except for one or two occasions a week, for two hours—a walk around the block once a week, when someone visited her. She praised the home nursing services, but most of the time she was either dealing with her sister or looking out of the window or at television. She was stranded and isolated, but she coped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the sister died after about five years of being cared for, Maureen explains how she tried, as carer, to pick up her own life. She went to the Department of Employment, on the advice of friends, and she was told by the young man who interviewed her that she did not qualify for unemployment benefit because
	<br><blockquote><p>"caring for a sick person was not a proper job".</p></blockquote>
I know that honourable Members on both sides of the Committee could describe cases similar to that of Maureen Oswin. We all realise that there are carers in many parts of Britain today who are trying bravely, courageously and nobly to cope with situations that are beyond our ken. At the very least, such people should have the right to ask for an assessment of their ability to cope, and if, in response to that request for assessment, it is deemed necessary to provide home help, nursing care or some other form of assistance, that help should be provided. If it calls for more resources—that is the logic of what we are asking—a decision should be made on the evidence that these people have not made too many demands on the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a moving speech about circumstances which I am sure we have all seen, if not experienced. I have come across numerous similar cases. My hon. Friend argued that more resources were needed, and I do not doubt that, but we also need to consider the use of existing resources. They are grossly misused in many cases, and I have cited examples in Committee, on the Floor of the House and elsewhere, of disabled people who have been forced into institutional care at a greater cost to the state than that of enabling them to live at home with their families. My worry is that the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0896">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1007</span>
does nothing to orient the use of public resources towards supporting such people at home. Does my honourable Friend agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do My hon. Friend, with his vast experience of this subject, which the Committee recognises, has made it clear that even within the existing system and in the absence of the assessments that we seek, there is inefficiency and waste. That is tragic in view of the clear need in many of our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister understands that we have tried albeit inadequately to articulate the rights and needs of many carers. If the Minister accepts the amendments, I do not suggest for one second that we shall have solved the problem but it would be a step in the right direction. It might even encourage the House and society to start thinking about the role of carers. The present position of informal carers clearly invites acceptance of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is still here because he may want to table some of my amendments to clause 49.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall divide my remarks into three. First, I shall deal with the problem of assessment to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) referred. Then I shall speak to amendment No. 500, dealing with carers, which the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) touched on. Then I shall say a word about housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem about the interaction between the obligations to assess in the Bill and rights under existing legislation, especially the Disabled Person (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. There will be a two-tier system of rights and entitlements unless we manage to compromise or reconcile clause 42(1) with existing rights. For example, section 4 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 gives disabled people a statutory right to request an assessment of their needs for services that come under clause 2 of the Bill and, if their needs are accepted have the right to services to meet those needs. Those people come under the broad community care umbrella and have rights to assessment and services. But those brought under clause 42 will not have rights to either assessment or services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Directors of Social Services is worried about the relationship between clause 42 and existing legislation that gives rights to disabled people. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health said in the House on 23 January, in column 733, that everyone who depended on community care should have the same treatment. Unless we deal with that tier of rights there will be first and second-class citizens. It would also be helpful if my hon. Friend the Minister for Health explained how she envisages clause 42 working in general terms—as there are several amendments to it—rather than dealing with each amendment narrowly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would happen if someone felt that he was entitled to an assessment but the local authority refused to assess him? As I understand it, he would have no rights to assessment. It would be inconsistent with the philosophy of the Bill for the local authority to say, "we are very sorry, but we are not going to assess you," or, "yes, we should like to assess you but we cannot do so for six months." What response should we give to our constituents who may ask about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
What happens, once people have been assessed and their local authority has agreed that they need a package of services, if the local authority then says, "We agree that you need those services, but we are very sorry, we are not going to provide them."? How could that response be reconciled with the expectations that people will have under the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the National Carers Association, and to its energetic director, Jil Pitkeathley. It has many branches, one of which is in my constituency. It attaches considerable importance to amendment No. 500, which gives the carer the right to be consulted and to play a part in the assessment. I do not go along with the view that carers should be allowed to opt out of responsibilities. I believe that parents have obligations to children which they should not be encouraged to opt out of; I also believe that people have obligations to their parents, which they should not be encouraged or allowed to opt out of. Although there are, of course, circumstances in which it is no longer realistic to expect them to go on caring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but does he accept that the Government's policy provides an inbuilt incentive for carers to opt out of their responsibilities—by pushing their dependants into institutional care? Money is not available to support the carer of an individual who lives in the community, but it is available for institutional care. Is not that inbuilt inecentive wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Indeed it is wrong, and the Bill puts it right. The thrust of its proposal is to remove the incentive for expensive institutional care. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health has made that point time and again, and she will no doubt repeat it and say that we are moving towards a level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Carers are worried that local authorities may notice that a carer is available and, when they compile their package, place totally unrealistic obligations on the carer and then neglect to review the situation a few months later, when the health of the carer or the person being cared for may have changed radically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen Mckay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should also consider that some carers are neighbours or friends rather than family, and they are torn between what they should do and what they have to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman is right. We all have cases in our constituences in which neighbours have helped out initially but have been drawn in to provide a whole range of services that the relatives of the person being cared for have opted out of providing. I am amazed that neighbours put up with that, given that they get relatively little help from the local or the district health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) made it clear that many of the carers are elderly people. While I was canvassing at the last general election, a frail lady aged about 75 came to the door. Once I had established that she was going to vote for the right party I offered her a lift to the polling station. She refused my offer, but said that her mother would like a lift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have held meetings about the Bill with members of my local branch of the National Carers Association. They See the Bill as an opportunity to get a squarer deal, which includes more respite care and, more home helps and other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
services. They are anxious to be part of the decision-making process. They therefore attach considerable importance to amendment No. 500, which seeks to include them in that process. Local authorities would have to take account of the abilities and views of any carer. That is the spirit of partnership that lies behind the philosophy of the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will be able to reassure and comfort—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Member, and in part agree with his argument. I am worried that there is in the Government's present funding arrangements an inbuilt incentive for carers to give up the ghost through lack of support. That means that dependent people who have been cared for in the community will go into institutional care, causing resources to flood in to keep them there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seems to be implying that the duty to carry out assessments will overcome such problems. I do not accept that. Those problems have been laboured in Committee, but the Government have still not resolved them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry is that the Bill rightly includes an assessment duty but it does not include a duty to develop alternatives to institutional care, or support for carers in the community, to prevent the need for people to go into institutions. The hon. Member has missed that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, but the financial incentive to which the hon. Member refers will not exist in future, because a totality of resources will be available to local authorities. If it is cheaper and more appropriate for authorities to build care packages around the needs of elderly people in their own homes, the authorities will have the financial incentive to do so rather than pay for residential care. The hon. Member should enthusiastically support clause 42, and the thrust of the Bill, because it will remove the incentive to which he refers. That incentive is possible at present only because the funds come from a different Government Department: the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 604 would require local authorities to take account of the housing circumstances, requirements and wishes of people who need community care. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr Hinchliffe) should agree that amendment No. 604 would help overcome the problem that he discussed, in that local authorities would be required, if possible, to provide a care package to meet the needs of people who want to stay in their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper states that the aim of the assessment
	<br><blockquote><p>"is first to review the possibility of enabling the individual to continue to live at home even if this means arranging to move to different accommodation within the local community".</p></blockquote>
So housing is considered an important part of the assessment of community care needs. If it is to be a vital component of community care provision individual assessment should focus essentially on housing circumstances. The amendment would ensure that people's housing circumstances and wishes were a natural part of the assessment process. Amendment No. 684 was a recognition that housing was not given the importance in the Bill that it should have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1010</span>
I hope that hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will respond to the public's genuine anxiety, and especially to carers' anxieties. He should define people's entitlements under the legislation, so that they know their position if an authority refuses to provide them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) is well motivated, but he is ignorant of the problems that face many carers and dependants as a result of the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a debate on handicaped people in the House I referred to the case of Pauline Shaw who has multiple sclerosis. Pauline has ended up in a private institution 20 miles from her home, where she has lived for most of her life. The social services cannot cope with her in the community, because, those services have been attacked by the Government's cuts. Pauline's husband, Jim Shaw, who is not wealthy, lives in the housing association sheltered flat that he used to share with Pauline. Jim desperately wants to be near his wife, but unfortunately she has had to move to the instituion, which is in Tory controlled Selby district council in North Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every day, Jim Shaw travels back and forth to be with his wife. He is on invalidity benefit of approximately £40 a week and is trying to run a car on that. He wanted a council house in the area near his wife, but Selby district council has sold so many council houses that he cannot have one. That is the reality. To talk glibly of housing policy, when the Government have encouraged the sale of such housing, is nonsense. I genuinely believe that some Conservative Members are well motivated but ignorant to the real problems faced by so many disabled people and their families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I support my hon. Friends in their remarks about involving the client and the carer. Adequate acknowlegment should be given to the need for flexibility to meet changes in circumstances among carers and clients. Clients should have the opportunity for representations to be made in their own cases when assessment is made, and that is the subject of a later amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to highlight the need for a slightly better definition of when the assessments may take place. If I heard him correctly, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) touched on the subject. I am slightly worried that the Bill could remove flexibility, which is in clients' interests and which we all believe is important. If some rigidity is created and if local authorities want, to give limited help— which must surely come under the heading of community care— they might have to go through the rigmarole of a formal assessment. We all know of local education authorities that feel that they can perform more effectively and flexibly to meet special education needs without participating in that procedure. We do not want to force local authorities into formal assessment if it is possible to avoid that in minor cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the years, assessment has been one of the weakest aspects in the consideration of community care. That is not only in relation to the elderly. Latterly, it has been a question of whether people have been assessed for accommodation in nursing or residential care homes, whether a placement is approriate and whether the social security system should pick up the bill and pay substantially towards the cost in respect of people for whom little assessment has been made over the years.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
Usually, people have gravitated into such homes, perhaps when they have become too infirm or frail for their relations to care for them or to live in their own homes. We should tackle assessment for much work needs to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially worried that, at present, social services authorities may not have sufficient skill and training in the assessment of clients for the correct form of care. As a former member of the august body CCETSW—the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work—I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to speak about the training which she and CCETSW may well wish to initiate for social workers and others who will assess people as part of their tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to widen the question of assessment for care in the community beyond the elderly. For the mentally ill and mentally handicapped, assessment has not always led to the best and most successful placements within the community.
