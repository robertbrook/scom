	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISABLED PERSONS (CARE OR PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 29(6) of the National Assistance Act 1948, a local authority shall be authorised to make payments to a disabled person for the purchase of care or personal assistance services.".— 	<i>[Mr. Rowe.]</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A minute or two ago, I thought that we had lost an audience. I think that it was Oscar Wilde who said, when his play flopped, that the play was a good one but the audience was a failure. I hope that I did not have mat effect on hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying before the adjournment that the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) has performed a considerable service by presenting the new clause. I then referred to the objectives of DIG, me Disablement Income Group. I am glad that I did so because my remarks might have been misunderstood as implying support, for example, for voucher schemes such as those advocated in the Griffiths report. That was not my intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to debate the new clause because it enables me to invite the Minister to tidy up an area where there are considerable shades of grey. Whether or not local authorities are seen as enablers or providers, in recent years there have been so many changes in social security arrangements that disabled people, their advocates and carers are confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome DIG's objective that the needs of people with disability should be met, regardless of the disability's origin. There should not be wide variations in benefits. If a person is born with a disability he gets less than someone with the same condition caused by an accident in me home, and the person who is unfortunate enough to experience such an accident in the home receives less benefit than someone who has precisely the same disability caused by an accident at work. Plainly, the needs are the same. I hope that, in the new clause, we are moving towards a recognition of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific issue raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent was brought to my attention by one of the finest groups that is active in the House. I refer to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1228</span>
Act Now group, which attempts to persuade the Government that they should implement the remainder of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. When the group tells me that a proposal is worth debating, I take its views very seriously. I hope that the Prime Minister takes the same view. On 7 July last year, the group presented her, at 10 Downing Street, with half a cake on the anniversary of the 1986 Act. The point was that she might get the other half of the cake when the Act is fully implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act Now group is anxious about the consumer's role and genuine choice, when choice can be made. It recognises the need for assessments, representation and advocacy before choice is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every case is unique and that is why assessment is necessary. The new clause argues, in effect, that sometimes it might be more appropriate for the local authority to agree to give a person money to make arrangements for his or her own needs than for public agencies to provide a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could be a controversial subject. Therefore, I should mention that I have not consulted my right honourable Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) and still less my next door neighbour, my right honourable and learned Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith), when I say that the matter is at least worthy of debate. It would be wrong to go further man that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, the new clause suggests that the Committee should examine how we respond to the specific needs of people with disabilities. In most instances, provision could and should be made by local and health authorities or public agencies, but in some circumstances, especially in rural areas, a person's needs might be met by his being free—provided that finance is available; that is the crucial factor—to arrange for his own home help, carer, purchase of aids, pulleys, wheelchair, and so on. If the Government gave local authorities that power—it would not limit their role in other important matters—the proposal may be well worth considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Minister to tell us the Government's views. In many instances, disabled people must consider two major issues. The first is the operation of the social fund, about which we heard so much in yesterday's ruling. Many people with disabilities may try to gain access to the social fund and be refused grants or loans because of cash limits. Although they may qualify, the money may have run out at the local office. That is unreasonable. It is reasonable to ask whether, in such circumstances, the local authority would be free under new clause 3 to assist and recognise the disabled person's needs and to make money available. I do not wish to open a can of worms, but if the money is to be ring-fenced no doubt the Minister will appreciate that life is made more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue relates to benefits and the independent living fund, which is being eroded. It seems that the limited cash made available for the fund is being redirected via local authorities. We cannot be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1229</span>
sure that it will reach those for whom it was intended—the people with disabilities and perhaps their carers. What are the Government's views on those two issues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Kent and I, and perhaps other Committee members, have been given case studies. I shall not discuss them in detail, but they show that in some exceptional cases it might be possible for the local authority to act as the enabler rather than the provider. However, I believe that die overwhelming role for local audiorities, properly resourced, is that of provider. Perhaps the case studies are known to the Minister. Organisations such as the British Association of Social Workers and, indeed, the Audit Commission have said that, in exceptional cases, the enabling role might be the best way to provide succour and recognition to people in special circumstances with disabilities. Given that the argument goes back a long way and will probably not be resolved today or in the remaining sittings, I shall not complain too wildly if the Minister says that it is not possible to accept new clause 3. I do not necessarily support the new clause. However, it gives us a splendid opportunity to open the door on to Government thinking so diat hon. Members can reflect on the Minister's response and on the contents of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked several questions after the Committee rose for lunch. I have since made inquiries, and it might be helpful to my hon. Friend the Minister for Health to know, before she replies, that a large social services department pays cheques to individual disabled people. That payment constitutes such a small proportion of its total care package that it has never had any problem with tax, but the department has had considerable problems with the authority's treasurer who wants many details about me way in which me money is spent. That social services department has now decided that using vouchers would be easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another county authority, Hampshire, pays through voluntary organisations, which provide help with monitoring. That involves me comparatively small number of 30 people. One or two of them are solely supported by the Independent Living Fund, and are therefore in a slightly different position. However, a doubt hangs over the future of mat organisation, and we must look carefully at what will take its place. The majority of disabled people in Hampshire are supported by Hampshire county council, but me money is syphoned through a voluntary organisation. I regard that as being expedient at the moment, but it is unsatisfactory in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health(Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should all be indebted to my hon. Friend the Minister for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) for raising an important issue. There is logic in what he envisages, because we are all concerned with empowering those which we hope will provide care and assistance. The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) also made some helpful remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the details that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent produced about local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column'>1230</span>
that provide a direct resource to disabled people which enables them to provide their own package of care. Frankly, mere is a lack of clarity in the way in which some authorities have been experimenting in what is an innovative but—in die right circumstances—valuable approach. The National Assistance Act 1948 precludes the payment of money to the disabled, as does schedule 8 of the National Health Service Act 1977. As my hon. Friend pointed out, some local authorities have been experimenting with mat method of payment. He referred to die Spinal Injuries Association, but that represents people who are capable of taking control of their lives and who deserve to be treated as full citizens despite the wretchedness and frustration of their physical disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this form of payment were widely available, it would be difficult to decide in some circumstances how widely available me payment should be. For example, with disabled people who are mentally frail or mentally handicapped, it would be hard to decide, without being unduly paternalistic, at what point one should draw the line. One would not want individual users to have undue pressure put upon them, for instance by their relatives. There would also be problems with the administrative burden, and with pricing and identifying the basic unit cost of the various elements of care. None of those reasons is sufficient for not considering die amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West tried to draw me into a discussion about social security benefits. I hope mat he will take it in good part when I say mat me matters to which he drew attention are the responsibility of social security Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper, "The Way Ahead: Benefits for Disabled People" took up the issue of consulting more widely with local authority associations and others about the way in which me independent living fund, for example, works. Following yesterday's news about the social fund, social security Ministers made it clear that they are considering again whether the regulations under which the social fund is administered may be overly prescriptive. The arguments are not against the essential principle. The proposals for the disabled are intended to empower and to provide choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With my hon. Friend's agreement, I shall reconsider the proposal because die issue is complex. Details need to be established, and it is possible that such a scheme cannot initially have the widest possible availability. The basic commitment is there, and we may table a clearer and more specific amendment when the Bill is in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a sensible and appropriate outcome. My hon. Friend me Minister made it clear mat she believes in die principle of self-determination for the disabled. Members of the Committee will be reassured that me issue will be considered again in another place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

order, Dame Janet. Earlier in our proceedings we discussed whether it was in order for members of the Committee to be intimidated by outside sources on the issue of how we carried out our duties as members of the Committee. I have a news release which suggests that I, as a Conservative Member of Parliament, have done something which I have not done. That is the sort of intimidation that we discussed earlier and I seek your guidance, Dame Janet. The news release named me—I am the only hon. Member who was named—and said that I voted for a cash limit on patients' drugs. In the report of our sitting on 1 February, my hon. Friend the Minister for Health states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But I say unequivocally that there will be no cash limit on the drug budget for the family practitioner services."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 February 1990; c.641.]</p></blockquote>
I seek your guidance on whether such intimidation is in order, Dame Janet—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your guidance, Dame Janet, on whether it is in order that as a member of the Committee I should be named specifically in relation to something that is untrue. That is intimidation of me in my attempt to carry out my duties as a member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The content of what is said or alleged is strictly not a matter for the Chair. If the hon. Member believes that it is a matter of privilege, there are means of dealing with it. I suggerst that the hon. Gentleman approaches Mr. Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Harriet Harman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The Bill sets out indicative drug budgets. If die Bill is enacted unamended, the Secretary of State would have the power to cash limit those budgets. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) wants to show his constituents that he will protect them against the effects of cash-limiting indicative drug budgets, he will have a chance to do so on Report. We shall table the same amendment—or one as near to it as we can get past the Clerk—to protect patients from cash limits on indicative drug budgets. The hon. Gentleman voted against an amendment mat would have protected patients by writing into the Bill a protection against cash-limiting indicative drug budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have heard sufficient. My previous ruling stands, which is mat this is not a mattter for the Chair. It is a matter of dispute which has already been discussed in Committee. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) wants to take it further, it is a matter of privilege to be taken to Mr. Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you very much, Dame Janet, for mat clear ruling. I am a Member of Parliament for a Scottish constituency, and there are special elements in the Bill dealing with Scottish matters. I shall accept your advice, and take the matter to Mr. Speaker. I shall draw his attention to another
	<span class='label label-info column'>1232</span>

There is a typing error in me new clause. "Health board" should read "health authority", although it encompasses both England and Scotland.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on new clause 5 will give which ever Minister replies to it the opportunity to correct the Government's earlier mistake of not accepting that there should be plans, backed by resources, to ensure that future care needs of elderly people leaving hospital are catered for before they are discharged. The amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the member for Newcastle, Central (Mr. Cousins) raised a fundamental issue about the interrelationship between health authority and local authority care in drawing up such plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on new clause 5 will give the Minister for Health another opportunity to change her view that it is not possible to implement section 7 of The Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986, which deals with the needs of disabled people who are discharged from hospital. The 	<i>Official Report</i> records that she stated that resources were not available to local authorities to enable them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause encompasses all those points. It would ensure that elderly people leave hospital when they are ready and that health authorities and local authorities are clear about future provision for the elderly whether in residential care or at home. If they were to be cared for at home, it would ensure that facilities are adequate and that resources are available to implement the plan agreed between local authorities, and health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen what happens when elderly people are discharged after a considerable stay in hospital, even when they are discharged at the right time. Our constituencies provide examples of district nurses and local authorities being unable, through no fault of their own, to meet the demands and needs of the growing number of elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes, however, elderly people are not discharged into the community when they are ready. In the South Manchester health authority area, wards for elderly people are being closed one after another because of financial crisis. Elderly people are forced back into the community before they are ready. No thoughtful provision can be made for their care in the community, because wards are often closed in crisis conditions, with only 24 hours notice. People are dumped back into the community without proper
	<span class='label label-info column'>1234</span>
consideration, and without co-ordination between local authorities and health authorities. The Bill gives us an opportunity to make better provision for elderly people. That is why the new clause is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were disturbed when the Minister for Health made her comments about the lack of resources, and the press were equally worried about what she said. In the north of England the press are looking carefully at how the basis of effective community care that the Bill envisages will be undermined if those parts of The Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act are not implemented because of a lack of resources. We have stressed again and again that resources must be made available if the Bill is to be effective and the Government's aspirations are to be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State has repeatedly said that the Government want good quality care and that they believe that the Bill will achieve it. The Opposition want to ensure mat that achievement is matched. If the Government believe in that principle, they cannot argue against the new clause. I should like the Under-Secretary of State to say clearly, line by line, why he does not believe that the new clause is desirable.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If each part of the new clause is studied, it will be clear that it contains the fundamental principles that the Government have expressed about the quality of care and the successful implementation of the Bill. The new clause is important to ensure that care plans are agreed between the local and health authorities before elderly people leave hospital. If the Government argue against the new clause they will be arguing against the fundamental principles of good community care. If they try to justify that, the Opposition will use every opportunity to expose the weakness of their proposals. I look forward to the reply by Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. All the people of this country want the Government to make decent provision for the growing number of elderly people in the community who need care and resources, and to ensure the integration of care between the health and local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not disappoint the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley). He asked me to go through the new clause line by line explaining why I believe that it should not be accepted. The new clause assumes mat every patient who has been in hospital for six months or more will require a joint care programme. That might not necessarily be so as some patients might be able to care for themselves with help from their families. But, under me new clause, there would be a duty on the health board to
	<br><blockquote><p>"agree a joint care programme to meet the needs of the individual and any carer".</p></blockquote>
That would have to be done whether or not it was required. That seems to be a recipe for employing large numbers of bureaucrats to intervene unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has proposed a new clause that would apply only to Scotland. He explained that the appearance of the term "health board," as opposed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1235</span>
"health board and health authority," was a misprint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the new clause states that health boards should
	<br><blockquote><p>"make a planning agreement with the local authority to arrange for the necessary services to be provided in the community to meet the needs of individuals and any carers,".</p></blockquote>
But the new clause does not state how carers might be involved in such agreements. It seems that the matter can be left to the health board and the local authority. I see from the hon. Gentleman's reaction that he did not intend that to be so, but that is what the new clause says. The hon. Gentleman invited me to go through the new clause line by line, which is what I am doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph (c) the new clause states that the health board should
	<br><blockquote><p>"make available to the local authority a level of resources which both authorities agree is adequate to provide the necessary services."</p></blockquote>
The aim of the Bill is to ensure that clear responsibility lies with local authorities for assessing needs and that resources will be provided to them to meet those needs. There does not need to be the requirement on local authorities to reach agreement with the health boards in order to carry out the responsibilities that are placed upon them. Therefore, paragraph (c) is not sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman mat, when the elderly or disabled are discharged from hospital, it is appropriate to make proper arrangements for them in the community, and that will be the responsibility of local authorities. It is also appropriate that there should be discussions with health boards or authorities and carers who provide support, be they the immediate family or others, because that makes sense and is good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I commended the hon. Gentleman's new clause to the Committee, we would establish a statutory, extremely bureaucratic and inflexible system that would apply in all cases, whereas I am assured that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will realise that it is preferable to have a flexible system geared to individual needs. That is what we propose and what my hon. Friend the Minister for Health has said repeatedly is the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West added his name to the new clause. I know that he will be anxious to hear my comments in response to the hon. Gentleman's words about the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. I do not wish to misrepresent the hon. Gentleman, who I think referred to section 7 of that Act. He seemed to press me on why the Government are unwilling to implement section 7. I refer him to paragraph 7.17 of the White Paper which makes it clear that we intend to review the need to implement section 7 after our experience of operating care programmes. The section applies equally to Scotland, as the White Paper records. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his new clause, which, as he said, is drafted defectively and does not meet the intentions that he has outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was right to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1236</span>
anticipate that I want to say something about new clause 5. A recent typing error was resolved without difficulty. If I thought mat that was all that worried the Minister, I feel sure that, again, we could agree, although the word "agreement" does not roll easily off his tongue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) made an excellent case, the more so because the Government have already accepted it in another place. In accepting section 7 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986, the Government realised that we cannot continue in the knowledge that people from long-stay psychiatric hospitals are being released into community care that does not exist if we mean what we way about community care. It will come to the matter of the elderly, which may worry the Minister. Only a few minutes from the House of Commons there are people who live in cardboard boxes. Many of them are elderly. Sadly, the problem does not end in London—far from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the 1986 Bill was going through the House, and the concept of community care was supported strongly by such organisations as MIND, Age Concern, Shelter and other relevant bodies, the Government accepted that there was a strong case for ensuring that assessments be made before patients left hospital to go into the community. If the Minister is worried about people who do not need services or recognition, that worry will emerge from the assessments. There is no need for concern there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I suspect worries the Government is that, even though they say that they accept section 7, they know that when assessments are made, and needs are identified that are not unreasonable, health boards, local authorities and health authorities should not bother about whether they are for England or Scotland. Instead they should respond to the needs of individual patients in those categories, including those in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister and hon. Gentleman can enlighten me about what he and his colleagues mean by the term "or disabled person". The hon. Gentleman may remember that I survived what can only be described as a very serious accident. I spent six months recovering. I was discharged from hospital in a wheelchair and it was doubtful whether I would ever live a normal life again—I have seven very badly damaged vertebrae. Would the hon. Gentleman have classified me or others like me as disabled? The hon. Gentleman realises that I did not need assistance from the local authority or relevant health board, and that I have made a full recovery. At the time of my discharge, bearing in mind that I was in a wheelchair, would he have classifed me as disabled? The point about discharge is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can save time by accepting the definition in the Disabled Persons (Services, Representation and Consultation) Act 1986. My argument will be brief because I realise that the Minister is convinced of the wisdom of the important principle of our argument. Why did the Government accept section 7? The principle is established and arguments about bureaucracy are tossed through the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1237</span>
window. They were not accepted in 1986 so why accept them now? They were accepted because the wisdom of stopping the situation whereby the wasteful system of what MIND calls the "revolving door", with people being discharged time after time into the community and perhaps then into another hospital or into the Salvation Army, was not lost on them. This was no way to deal with modern community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill was granted Royal Assent, and section 7 came into force, the Government, including the Prime Minister, said many times that the section would be implemented when resources became available. Nothing was said of the wording of the White Paper, which suggested seeing how the Bill worked and that after that section 7 would be considered. The House did not know that section 7 would be implemented until last July, just before the summer recess, when the Secretary of State, was compelled to make a statement on the Griffiths report, announced out of the blue that section 7 would not be implemented. That came as an enormous shock to sponsors of the Bill, who came from all parts of the House and to local authorities which had been involved in long and—I say to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland—costly negotiations for almost four years on how to implement section 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Secretary of State made the announcement and was pressed about why he did so, he said— astonishingly—that the Government would not rush to implement section 7 because he thought that it did not go far enough. As it does not go far enough to embrace the elderly, as the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland states, my hon. Friend the Member for Withington has given the Government the opportunity to make it go further, so there is no cause for complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister, who may think that the new clause is badly drafted, confirms the principle that the Government have accepted, we shall give him every cooperation in redrafting it. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Withington would agree, provided that we embrace the principle of section 7 which was endorsed by the House and provided that the Minister says what he has said in the same spirit as the Secretary of State for Health, who said that section 7 does not go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wants property assessments and arrangements for elderly and disabled people who leave hospitals in such circumstances and wants to end the scandal of community care that does not exist, thereby giving such care a bad name, the Opposition might readily agree. He might find that he has got himself a bargain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By raising this vital issue, my hon. Friend the Member for Withington went to the heart of what community care means, or does not mean, for many people. Until we solve the problem we cannot really say that we are providing, accepting or endorsing a strategy for community care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may respond briefly to the hon. Member for Monkland, West (Mr. Clarke). First, I am surprised that he has such little
	<span class='label label-info column'>1238</span>
faith in local authorities and their ability to use the care plans to ensure that needs are met. Secondly I am surprised that he does not give a little credit for our plan to introduce specific grant schemes for those suffering from mental illness, which comprise the very group covered by section 7 of the disabled persons 1986 Act. The two developments of the specific grants scheme and the care plans will enable local authorities and health boards in Scotland to work together to meet the objectives which, I freely recognise, the hon. Gentleman believes could best be secured through section 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said that we shall proceed with the care plans and specific grant scheme. If in the light of experience we consider it appropriate, we should be prepared to consider the implementation of section 7. We are not saying that we shall not do that, but we should like experience of the new system in operation before taking a view on the matter. It might be appropriate when a local authority has not used the new powers and responsibilities. As most of the authorities in Scotland are, I regret to say, controlled by the Labour party, surely the hon. Gentleman should have more faith in them to carry out their obligations. It would not be appropriate to accept the new clause at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful to the Minister for going through die new clause line by line. It showed that the Government were looking for nitpicking reasons not to accept it. They were riddling away, as they usually do on such matters. They appear to accept a principle although they do not want to act on it. It is outrageous that they will not implement section 7 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) act 1986. They merely say that they will reconsider it in the light of a new Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister did not argue against the principle of the new clause, I accept the invitation proffered through my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) to get together with the Minister. I am sure that together we could agree a new clause that we could agree line by line, to ensure that quality of care is matched by deeds on the Floor of the House on Report. I am sure that together we could agree a new clause that would match the requirements of the elderly and the disabled when they are discharged from hospital. I welcome that opportunity, and no doubt we shall discuss the matter with great unaminity across the Floor of the House on Report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister will probably know, me new clause is based substantially on die ten-minute Bill that I introduced last October. It contains additional provisions relating to local authority functions and the rights of people in residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In previous debates reference was made to the provisions in the Wagner report. I note mat die Minister for Health keeps a copy on the table in front of her, and probably knows it pretty well. She will no doubt appreciate that much in the new clause relates directly
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
to the recommendations of the Wagner Committee. I hope mat the concerns expressed for the rights of those in residential care will impress upon the Government the need to change the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous debate, I said that in some European countries—West Germany, for example—the law requires mat any person who is admitted to residential care must have a contract with the individual who provides that care. That contractual arrangement must be made by law, and every admission is controlled by the appropriate legislation. There is some sense in that approach. Indeed, disputes have arisen here in the absence of a formal agreement between the residents and manager or proprietor of me home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 6 would introduce a clear legal framework to protect the residential security of those admitted to care and to place certain duties on local authorities to protect die interests of people who may be asked to leave private or voluntary care or nursing homes. Our reasons must be fairly obvious to those who know about me subject. The law is somewhat complex, and it has worried me that few people who end up in care have any idea of their legal rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surrounded by lawyers and can be corrected by any who may know these provisions more fully man I do. As I understand it, paying residents who enter care or nursing homes possess certain common law rights of occupation, but very few know of those rights and their legal position. It must be said that their legal position under common law may be somewhat limited. New clause 6 would simplify and clarify die legal position, especially for those who may be asked to leave care for various reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable, isolated and dependent people who have little idea of their rights. We should guarantee in law certain rights to protect them when they are vulnerable and when they may have no one outside the home who is prepared to stand up for them and represent their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent of the problem highlighted by die new clause is difficult to assess. Nationally, Age Concern has certain worries about the matter. I have had discussions with some of its parliamentary representatives who supported my attempt in the ten-minute Bill to effect a change in the law. Through personal constituency cases, and discussions with other hon. Members, I know mat a problem exists. I do not suggest that it is widespread but it is sufficiently of concern that we need to act. The Bill is an appropriate vehicle to help to protect people whose interests may be affected in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give two examples to illustrate why I was motivated to table die new clause. Before I came to Parliament, I dealt with the case of an elderly lady who was placed on short stay in a private home in the Wakefield area while her family went abroad for a fortnight. This lady was admitted and, within an hour of her being left in that home, someone there determined that the home was unable to look after her because she was confused. She was packed off in a taxi to me local police station. That was highly irresponsible of people in a caring situation. That criticism applies to any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
sector. The woman should not have been admitted to the home in the first place. If an assessment had been made prior to admission, she may have been sent somewhere else. No doubt her relatives needed a break, but I am concerned about the way in which she was treated. She was turfed out of me home and had no legal security in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report to the social services committee of die Sheffield local authority during 1989 expressed anxiety about individuals being dumped out of private homes. The report described how a woman had been dumped at the outpatients' department of a hospital because she was deemed difficult to handle by a home. They may be isolated examples, but there is a common problem. The report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is more common to hear of relatives being forced to make alternative arrangements for the care of a relative often with little, if any, prior notice."</p></blockquote>
there are such cases in every constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ask why people are already being asked to leave homes, and especially to consider me condition of some residents. A formal assessment would prevent a person being admitted to a home when he or she was unsuitable to be cared for mere. Under the Bill, vast numbers of people will arrive in private or voluntary homes without any formal assessment. The assessment process may be bypassed by many people who have sufficient capital and resources not to need any form of income support top up. Relatives may approach a home and say that they wish an individual to enter on the basis mat they can pay me fees independently and privately. In such circumstances, there is no need for a formal assessment and the social services department may have no knowledge of mat person's circumstances. I am anxious about such cases, especially if the person involved is asked to leave a home after a short time and has little security or idea of what will happen next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more common occurrence is that an individual's capital runs out. We have debated long and hard the inadequacy of income support and the Florence Smiths of Maistone and elsewhere. Income support does not always meet the fees that have to be paid. Many people who enter private care without income support spend their capital. When they then have to rely on income support, they find mat the home is not prepared to supplement them and they are asked to leave because they cannot pay for their accommodation. In those circumstances, people should have legal rights mat are safeguarded and procedures should trigger assistance for them. The new clause would ensure that me local authorities are aware of the circumstances and have a duty to assist people and safeguard their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to people who enter private care without any form of assessment? The Bill requires local authorities to draw up care plans. It is in the local authority's interests to be aware of the type of people who are accommodated in private, voluntary and state establishments in its area. New clause 6 would ensure that local authorities are notified of every admission to private or voluntary homes in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1242</span>
Local authorities frequently have no knowledge of admissions, even when, as in my constituency, there are active and excellent registered homes officers who have a good relationship with the private and voluntary sectors. They are kept in touch and make it their business to be aware of admissions, although there may still be admissions that are not picked up by the local authority. It is in the interests of local authorities in drawing up their care plans for them to know what sort of people and how many are admitted to homes in the private sector in their area. The new clause would make mat possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 6 is common sense. It is based on the Wagner report and on principles to which I hope Conservatives and Socialists subscribe. It is in the interests of the human beings who are cared for in private or voluntary homes. I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 15 relates to provisions for domiciliary services which will be affected by changes in the Bill which allow a change of provider. We are damned certain that mat is a privatisation measure. Although I accept that voluntary organisations might take the provision, in most instances it will be private agencies. New clause 15 would ensure mat the consumers of the service, those who use the home help service, for example, would have a say in who takes on the provision when the local authority proposes a change of provider. Elderly people who have a home help would want to be certain that a private agency is reputable and not a cowboy outfit of the sort that cleans hospitals and is involved in other functions brought about by me Government's privatisation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 15 would give people who use services the right of veto if they feel that the company or voluntary organisation does not do the job as well as the local authority. It gives them the right to retain the existing provider. The Minister cannot object to new clauses 6 or 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) did not mention the law of contract, and I shall cite a case which shows why there should be such a law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November 1986 there was a case conference of representatives of the social services, the area health authority and the officer in charge of a home about the case of Mr. Brian Wood. That case conference decided that Mr. Wood should be resident at the Linden Villa nursing home. Some form of contact—I say that deliberately—was signed by Mrs. Wood on behalf of all die participants for a fee of £205 a week. It was decided that the DSS would pay £170 and the health authority £35. The £205 a week was paid until June 1988 when the fee increased to £230. There was no discussion with the health authority or the DHSS about where mat money would come from. It seemed that it would have to come from Mrs. Wood. The owner of Linden Villa realised mat the area health authority had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1243</span>
paid ultra vires, that the money had to be refunded to the health authority from the DHSS and that the DHSS might fund the £230. He decided that £1,950 belonged to him and without any notification, Mrs. Wood received a bill for that sum. It was suggested that pressure be put on the health authority and the DHSS for that money to be paid over. There was no change of contract, if it can be called a contract. That is when Mrs. Wood came to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man insisted that the money was his. The DHSS insisted that it could not pay retrospectively back to 1986; it was then 1988. As the payment was ultra vires, the health authority had to agree to waive its £35, which it should not even have paid in the first place, so mat the burden did not fall elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a legal binding contract has been made in 1986, there would necessarily have been another discussion between those people before the fee was increased. There would then have been no argument because all would have been fully aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas taxpayers' money may have been used in such circumstances, such problems will now be shovelled on to the back of the poll tax payer. Without contracts between such people, poll tax payers will be left (exposed) to the consequences of prices being increased in that way. A contract is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the matter to solicitors and said that, in my opinion, the form that had been signed—even though it was a booking form—was a legal document that should be upheld in court. I was told that that was a possibility but that mere was a strong possibility that it could not be upheld. It was explained to me that it could be held to be a signed document of understanding—not a form of legal contract—and understandings can change. The solicitors decided that they would, if necessary, take on the case; I said I would pay for it because, clearly, Mrs. Wood could not. They very kindly did not charge me fees. In fact, the matter did not go to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, Mr. Wood broke a hip and went into hospital. The DHSS rules said that the full fee could be paid for six weeks and thereafter at two thirds. The owner of the home said that he wanted the full fee and that he wanted to recoup the £1,950 that he thought should belong to him and to no one else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, £230 was charged for each week in hospital. I had six weeks in which to remove Mr. Wood from hospital into another home because the owner insisted that it was at his discretion whether he charged the full fee of £230 a week, irrespective of whether the person was in the home, purely and simply to retain the bed for when Mr. Wood came out of hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further information led me to believe that die room was being sub-let for a short term, in which case the owner was claiming £230 and getting £250 a week for sub-letting. That seemed to be confirmed when the hospital said that it had received a request that Linden Villa should have two weeks' notice before Mr. Wood came out of hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making an important point. Some of the larger organisations moving into the private care business seem to apply
	<span class='label label-info column'>1244</span>
that practice regularly. That is deplorable when someone is paying for a room in such circumstances. If a person is admitted to a home and subsequently enters hospital, but retains his bed in the home, he should have a right to know that his bed will not be used by someone else. It is worrying that beds are double let. I hope that the Minister for Health will condemn the practice and promise to take action against homes which act in this way. Unfortunately, the practice is growing, especially among large organisations that are moving into residential care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further confirmation that the bed had been sub-let was that the resident's clothes were in a plastic bag in the cellar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not complaining about the home, private or not. It gives a good and essential service. My argument is that a price was agreed and it should have prevailed until a different agreement was made with the resident. I am anxious to protect, first, the family, secondly, the patient, thirdly, the DHSS and, fourthly, the poll tax payer because of cost. A contract is essential. We could include a contract requirement in the Bill-a genuine contract provision, not merely a proposal for a booking form or reservation form. It would be legally binding in court, with all me protection that that affords. Linden Villa nursing home is a good home, and tightly run. I have no complaints on that score, or on cost. I merely use it as an example of what is taking place and what ought to be prevented by providing in the Bill for a law of contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the hon. Members for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay) raised important matters. After taking advice from those legally better qualified that I am, may I make it clear that a person who goes into a home has, in effect, made a contract, whether an explicit, written, properly appreciated contract or a verbal contract which could be open to confusion and misunderstanding, especially when thing go wrong?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of an explicit agreement with residents of a home has frequently been acknowledged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was outlined in the report "Home Life" of 1984, which was endorsed by the men Secretary of State as a guide to good practice. The Wagner report, which the hon. Member for Wakefield mentioned, made the same recommendation. Only recently, I launched a further follow-up caring and homes initiative on the back of the Wagner report. We shall spend more than £2 million for an action and research project with a number of agencies to try to promote good practice. The acceptance of the need for a proper understanding with residents in home is one aspect of it. We are working with the National Institute for Social Work, the Social Care Association, the Polytechnic of North London, the Policy Studies Institute, Brunei university and the social services inspectorate in an attempt to promote high standards of residential care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read with interest the ten-minute Bill of the hon. Member for Wakefield on 18 October 1989. He will understand that we do not intend to enshrine that provision in legislation. We do intend, however, that all the levers at our disposal are used and that the areas of our influence in the residential sector are left in no

	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
doubt when it comes to the importance of proper treatment of residents of homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that at the heart of the complaints about what took place in Kent? If agreements had existed in the Kent case, there would not have been a scandal? Surely the Minister realises that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall spell out in greater detail some of the measures that will be effective from April, which I hope hon. Members will realise are a force for good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is already a requirement under the 1984 residential care homes regulations that a registered person should give reasonable notice of his intention to cease providing accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but can the Minister say what sanctions are available to a local authority if mere is clear evidence—which many authorities have—that that does not happen? I suspect that adherence to the provision is the exception rather than the rule in many homes. What action are the Government taking to enforce it? It seems that currently it is not being enforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point of the enforcement of many provisions in the Bill. When local authorities purchase places in residential homes, they will establish contracts. We expect the anxieties expressed by the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone to be identified and specified. Instead of the present regime in which, so often, financing is established via the income support limit without a named worker following up the case, under the case management system there will be an ongoing commitment to the well-being of individuals in residential care homes. As for bargaining power, the residential home will attempt to continue to provide care for the local authority, which will have leverage over that home by means of the established contract and the case manager and, more importantly, by the arm's-length inspection unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have issued preliminary guidance on ways of establishing the arm's-length inspection unit, but a requirement for proper agreements, or more formal contracts, with people going into residential care can be met by local authorities exerting influence over homes in their area. We must ensure as a Committee that a uniformly high standard of care is given. I am pleased that on this occasion we have not resorted to discussing whether care is local authority provided, or provided by the voluntary sector or privately. We agree that in whichever circumstances it is given, a proper standard should be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not said anything about the amendment. It merely asks for an agreement. Why cannot there be an agreement? Who is the Minister trying to protect? Why not draw up a model document mat applies nationally, perhaps with varying terms and conditions, and lays down minimum standards, which the home owner must sign. What is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1246</span>
wrong with having that piece of paper? It is not as if it will vary from person to person in each home. It is more likely that one signed agreement will apply to each resident of the home. Why cannot the hon. Lady concede this simple principle? It is not as though she is imposing a draconian administrative task on owners of homes. It is a reasonable, sensible proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause requires a resident to enter into a formal agreement with the owner of the home but does not impose a reciprocal obligation on the home owner. We do not think it appropriate to provide for the drawing of a specified legal document in the Bill. We do think it appropriate to ensure that, through our guidance, home owners are fully aware of the importance of having the arrangement under which the resident enters the home explained properly and understood fully. This would enhance the well-being of the home owner and die residents. We do not think it appropriate to include such a provision in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman need be in no doubt about our serious intent to establish higher standards in residential care if only because of the number of initiatives I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for new clause 15, it would not be appropriate to provide for a formal consultation process if there were a change of provider of care. Once again, it is important mat the needs of residents are properly taken into account. This will be done through me medium of case managers, community care plans, complaints procedures and a number of other channels mat will be open to users of services. Local authorities will be expected to provide the best possible standard of care and choice mat their resources allow. That is the profound philosophy behind our proposals, and we are serious in our intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister for Health and her officials have failed to notice that there is a huge gap in me Bill, which new clause 6 would fill. She said that the new clause was not necessary because local authorities would examine the details of contracts and exercise their influence. That may happen in some good authorities, but not in every authority. Vast numbers of people who enter private homes will not be assessed and will have no contact with local authorities. In addition, local authorities will have no contact with those homes, apart from during the registration process. I refer to areas such as Harrogate, which is crammed witii large institutions full of wealthy old ladies and not to areas such as my own where most people are fairly poor. The Minister's argument will not make a hap'orth of difference to them because those people will not be protected by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to read the document that we issued about independent inspection units. A home must provide an adequate standard of care and satisfy the local authority in several important ways before it can be registered. I do not support the argument that individuals with independent resources should not have the freedom to establish themselves where they choose. We must ensure that those who provide care, whether in the private, independent or local authority sectors, understand the arrangements that apply when frail and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>
vulnerable people enter into their care. That is built into the provisions and will be ensured at the contract and case management stages by means of the inspection units and the guidance offered by the Department through the offices of the social services inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the new clause, but I give a clear assurance that the Government are using every opportunity to spell out precisely the importance of the measures that they are introducing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), wishes to speak in a later debate. Those who will have the greatest responsibility for monitoring standards of care in private homes are not the independent inspection units but the relatives of residents. That is because the relatives have contact with the owners of the homes, and can enforce arrangements. If such arrangements were set out clearly in a document, the relatives could ensure that registered home owners abided by them. By rejecting new clause 6, the Minister will prevent relatives having a basis from which to argue a case for the protection of residents. She places on the independent inspection units a responsibility which, in time, as is always the case, they will have insufficient resources to fulfill. Standards will not be upheld in the way that the Minister has tried to assure the Committee that they will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I think that she understands the idea behind the new clause, and that our motivation is not political but an attempt to try to implement the Wagner report. She mentioned "Home Life", and recommendations have been made in other reports. I cannot accept her claim that effectively there is already a contract. According to my information, in most homes residents do not receive a piece of paper that details their rights. They have no guarantee of privacy or of anything else that should be guaranteed according to "Home Life" and the Wagner report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important misunderstanding. I am advised that a legal contract exists when someone enters a home, even if the contract is only verbals. Verbal contrasts are open to misunderstanding and accordingly I support the points that were made by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). Written documents are more satisfactory all round and make working easier. We had a similar discussion over written assessments or care package plans. I take the point about the importance of relatives, but the key point is whether the arrangement should be written into law, which is the area of dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder what legal position people would be in if they had a verbal contract but were asked to leave a home because they had wet their bed? What use is a verbal contract when someone is told, "I am sorry, you have wet the bed. You are unsuitable for this home; you are out on your neck."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response that in such circumstances one has a verbal contract is frankly meaningless. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
worried that that will be a growing problem. The Minister should recognise that, grasp the nettle now and do something about it. I must return to her point about local authority rule—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the years I have formed the view that a confident Minister shows flexibility towards a reasonable amendment. That is the test of a Minister's confidence, and it is the test of this Minister in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has more experience about that than I have, and I shall take his word on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the Minister seems to be saying that the involvement of local authorities—which arises through the assessment and registration processes and the contracts that authorities have with particular homes—will protect the people covered by new clause 6. I am sorry to say that it will not protect them—not even those who are covered by local authority contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there would be an ongoing commitment to the well-being of people under case management. What she means is that social workers will keep in contact with those people, which is an adminsitrative chore. People will be assessed and placed, and then, frankly, they will be forgotten, because the Government have resisted reassessment and review. People's histories will be put in a filing cabinet, where they will gather dust, and that will be it. The Minister said that someone who is placed in a home will be actively reviewed. As a former practising social worker, she knows that that does not and will not happen, because there is not time to do it. There is no supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the many people who will not be formally assessed, and who will be open to exploitation in ways in which the Minister appears to be unaware. Most of those people will be wealthy Tory voters who have gone into a home without any form of income support. The hon. Lady has completely misunderstand the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee unduly, but I must spell out for the hon. Gentleman what the system of placing contracts will mean in practice. At the moment when an individual is placed in a residential home, he or she simply has to secure the funding of income support. Under the new regime the local authority will be able to use that contract constructively to secure the interests of the individual, to make explicit the requirements for monitoring the contract, and to ensure that its terms are applied. I join the hon. Gentleman in deploring the case that he mentioned. But, whatever the outcome for the individual, when a home fails to comply with the standard of care, it will face the inspection unit and the immediate leverage of the extent to which the local authority places contracts in that home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me give the example of Harrogate in west Yorkshire. It is the best example of a place that is crammed full of large homes with rich old ladies. Many of those homes will not be contractually involved with local authorities because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1249</span>
their residents will pay using their own capital and not have income support. They will be old, wealthy Tory voters. What about those people? The Minister forgets that there is a huge gap; I accept that there will be an inspection process, but local authorities will not be contractually involved. Will the Minister respond?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I addressed that problem in my earlier remarks. I made it clear that not only is there provision in the Bill for arm's-length inspections, which is important, but the hon. Gentleman's proposal is extremely invidious in that people would not be allowed to go into the residential home of their choice and at their own expense, without being subject to an assessment. That is not acceptable in a free society. Therefore, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister is relying on regulatory pressure, and not acknowledging the free market and individual rights? What will happen when local authorities enter quasi-contractual obligations with homes in areas such as London, where there are few homes, and those are expensive? Will not local authorities, far from being able to exert pressure through regulation, have to enter open-ended commitments in which the price that they pay for services increases, with no ceiling? Will by hon. Friend bring that to the Minister's attention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made the point effectively. I am disappointed at the lack of response from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have concluded that we are dealing with a free-market Bill. New clause 6 is seen to be an undue influence in the free market. The Opposition are worried about the rights of individuals in care, who are vulnerable, elderly and dependent. They have no one to stand up for them. The Minister seems to disregard the motivation behind the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should press the Minister on one issue. She said that people assessed in the public sector will be covered by contracts and by the independent inspection unit. The Minister also said that in the private sector people will be covered only by the independent inspection unit. Therefore, she is denying to all the non-contract people in the private sector the protection that is available in the public sector. One could almost use the term used by the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop): is not the Minister adopting a "hybrid" principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has pinpointed the problem. I hope that between now and Report the Minister will recognise and reconsider that anomaly. Thosands of elderly people will be affected by it and the Minister should be worried about it.

The Opposition will not press the new clause now but we shall return it on Report. I hope that the Minister will then have her own proposals to deal with the huge

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time. As you know, Dame Janet, we have waited a long time for this debate. It will be an interesting debate on Wales, and it will probably compensate for last Saturday's temporary set back for the Welsh. I am confident that, although we might not win the match, we shall win more points during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of me new clause is to exclude Wales from die provisions that set up NHS trusts and fundholding general practices. The proposals are irrelevant to Wales and they are contrary to the principles upon which the NHS was founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of the people of Wales believe passionately in the concept of a publicly funded health service and in the statutory obligation of health authorities to provide comprehensive health care to their districts. The concept of the NHS trust hospital is a departure from the philosophy within which the NHS was conceived. The Government cannot argue otherwise with regard to Wales. About 75 per cent of the people of Wales did not vote for the Conservative party at the last election, and I believe that me majority of the Government's supporters in Wales reject these plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The setting up NHS trusts in Wales will inevitably lead to a two-tier Health Service. I do not ask the Committee to take my word for it. Instead, I ask the Committee to reflect on the words of the Minister when we considered clauses 5 to 10 in January. The Minister said that when NHS trust hospitals were established they would be centres of excellence. How does one judge whether something is a centre of excellence? It is a relative statement. It presupposes centres of mediocrity. It presupposes centres that are average performers. That is a two-tier system. That is the concept that the Government are happy to support in setting up NHS trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NHS trusts will be given incentives over and above the incentives given to other hospitals. When opt-out schools were proposed we were assured that they would not be given more money than state schools. We now know that opt-out schools have been given more money by the Government. That will happen with NHS trust hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are irrelevant to Wales because it is a mostly rural country with a scattered population where it would be difficult for the contracting system that is to be set up under me Bill to work effectively. How can there be an NHS trust hospital in Gwynedd, for example and another one in south Wales? The idea is nonsense and would not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Christmas I asked the Welsh Office in a parliamentary question how many hospitals in Wales
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
had expressed an interest in being given NHS trust status. Not one had. I should be interested in the response of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales today. Have any hospitals expressed an interest since then? I suspect that not many hospitals in Wales will queue to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from a letter from Dr. David Williams, a GP from Holywell, who is here listening to our proceedings and who has been active in these matters. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But, we, in Wales, would surely prefer to have equality of access to care. We do not want a showpiece hospital in Cardiff, a showpiece hospital in the North and a barren waste elsewhere. We believe in Community, in Community care, and in Community Hospitals integrated into a high standard service. We believe in the proper use and accountability of public money."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that Dr. Williams speaks for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has tremendous ability as a salesman. He quickly recognised that the concept of the GP budget, which he inherited, could not be sold to the medical profession. Whatever he, the Minister or the Prime Minister said, doctors were convinced that the intention was to cash limit their budgets and, in return, they would be given more choice of where to send their patients for treatment. Doctors would be expected to exercise financial discipline, and each decision would have to be justified on the ground of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government knew mat they had been lumbered with goods that they could not sell. As a consequence, the Secretary of State deployed selling techniques that would do credit to a computer or insurance company manual. He offered a free gift, a discount and green shield stamps on a "return if you don't like it" basis. The Minister outlined the full offer in Committee in January. I asked myself how I could get my hands on a GP budget. "What a bonanza" I thought. I could qualify as a doctor, build myself a spanking new surgery with four years tax-free savings and flog it off on my retirement, using my capital gains tax retirement allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It did not take me, or the people of Wales, long to realise that the budget has other implications. The best salesman in the world cannot for long disguise the small print or hide the fact that he is selling shoddy goods. I told a GP friend that the Minister said, "No one will be forced to enter the system. You can leave it if it does not work and ask for more money mid-year if the money runs out. No VAT will be charged on your practice and there will be no income tax on your savings. You will be given £32,000 for your administrative costs." I asked my friend what he thought of that as a bargain. He said, "I wouldn't be interested because when doctors have been ensnared into the system by die inducements, the bag will close. When enough doctors are in the new system, the budget will begin to bite and cash limits will be introduced." Give die Government two or three years of the new system and cash limits will be introduced. That is why few doctors in Wales will want to be in the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
I am a realist. I know mat the Government will not accept die new clause, but I will make diem an offer. They know that their proposals are not welcome in Wales. They should try out their reforms in England first to see how they work. If the Government can convince the people of England that they work in practice we will listen to them.

I am offering a lifeline to the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. He knows how unpopular—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. He is Member of Parliament for a Welsh constituency. He knows the proposals are unpopular and I hope that he has die good sense to recognise a lifeline when he sees one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause was tabled in my name and mat of my hon. Friend die Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and the hon. Member for Ynys M6n (Mr. Jones). I share die view of me hon. Member for Ynys M6n that integrated health care is needed in Welsh communities. Unlike me hon. Gentleman, however, I do not wish these appalling reforms on people in England or Scotland. Wales has different requirements and the new clause would avoid certain measures in die Bill being applied to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The soft words and the more responsive nature of the Secretary of State and me Under-Secretary of State for Wales generate die feeling mat Ministers at me Welsh Office will save us from the full effects of the Bill merely because they are not as abrasive or as passionately blinkered as die Secretary of State for Health, but as we learnt from the Water Act 1989—water price rises have hit people only in me last week—and other measures, the Government's proposals fall as heavily on people in Wales as they do on those in England and Scotland, irrespective of die soft words. It is me words in die legislation that count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales needs different treatment. I concur mat mere is no interest in hospital trusts in Wales, as the Under-Secretary of State for Wales confirmed in a previous sitting. There is deep suspicion of practice budgets and indicative drug budgets among doctors and die public. There is overwhelming opposition to the clauses that the amendment seeks to exclude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Wales accepted that Wales has different needs from those of England and Scotland, but neither die Bill, nor die White Paper nor the papers that implement them recognise or reflect those differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A factual analysis underlies die need for comprehensive planning and die careful use of resources in Wales. It shows that die measures that die new clause seeks to delete are inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general statistics, Wales appears little different, demographically, from England, but mere are considerable differences in its demands on die Health Service. In die age groups that most require die Health Service—diose under 15 and over 65—die numbers in England and Wales are not vastly different, but the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
average rate per thousand for long-standing illness in all age groups is 24 per cent higher in Wales than it is in England. There is a higher rate in each age group, but in the under-four category it is 70 per cent higher in Wales. The 1987 figure for male mortality in Wales is 5 per cent higher than it is in England. There are significantly higher rates in other categories. There are significantly higher rates in some categories. The rate of heart disease is 8.7 per cent higher among males and 6.7 per cent higher among females. The rate of cerebrovascular disease is 6.7 per cent higher for men and 9 per cent higher for women. There is a 16.6 per cent higher rate of bronchitis, emphysema and asthma. It is interesting to note that the reduction in cigarette smoking has been faster in Wales than in England, so those respiratory problems are not the result of individual patterns of behaviour but due to industrial and environmental conditions and patterns of health care in Wales. That is a convincing argument for the need for Wales to receive specifically different treatment in die Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures on pharmaceutical services show that the number of prescriptions per person per year in Wales is 9.4 compared with 7.1 per cent in England. The net ingredient cost is therefore £39.93 per person in Wales, which is 22 per cent higher than in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the Bill is die Government's attempt to save money on Wales. I worry for die Government mat the needs of people in Wales, as reflected in those higher figures, will not be met because the proposals may bear down on die medical services and doctors in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
GP list sizes show mat only 6 per cent of GPs in Wales have lists over 2,500, compared with 13 per cent in England. There is a difference in die nature of die service and die demands on the time and work of GPs in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adult disability rates also demonstrate significantly different factors in Wales. Disability of all categories in Wales is 21 per cent higher man in England. Even when adjusted for the differing age profiles of die populations, Wales has an 18.5 per cent higher rate of disability. The worst comparison is in die most severely disabled. For every five severely disabled people in Wales, there are only two in. Great Britain as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those facts and statistics demonstrate die need for new clause 8 and for the application of other clauses to be removed from Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welsh doctors are worried mat they have not received any reassurance about die future of die Welsh medical advisory structure, which currently has a direct input in discussions with die Welsh Office. The Welsh Office is judge and jury in its own case and has authority over die Health Service. There is no regional health authority to take mat strain. It is important mat the people of Wales are protected. The Welsh advisory body's input is even more important under the planned reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed increase in the family health services authorities' powers, such as monitoring, indicative
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
drugs budgets and die new direct line of control to the FHSAs from the Secretary of State, is also important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses to which new clause 8 refers create additional difficulties for Wales. It would be better to accept new clause 8 and withdraw application of the other clauses to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to quote Dr. Bryan Davies, the Welsh Secretary of die British Medical Association and to stress that his view is representative of all GPs in Wales. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Money and patients will be flowing across Wales in many different directions as a result of these proposals. How can this benefit the individual patient?"</p></blockquote>
The application of clauses 5 to 10 and clauses 13 to 16 will give rise to confusion and create a worse service in Wales. Hospitals in Wales with lower capital charges could see an influx of patients from outside their districts. Wales may end up providing a service to people outside its boundaries, which would not benefit those most in need. The level of need was clearly demonstrated by the statistics that I gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no reassurance that the money at regional level for indicative drugs budgets will not be provided at die expense of other parts of die service. I stress that there is no regional health authority in Wales, and if die general practice drugs budget is exceeded, additional funding must come from die Welsh Office. Where is die leeway in that arrangement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur with die hon. Member for Ynys Môn about the problems with treatment centres and recycling money. When dealing with care in die community, we stress me housing element. Yesterday, we read that the director of TAI Cymru told die Select Committee mat die Welsh Office does not give his organisation the money to do die job. The problem always comes back to the Welsh Office and to die Under-Secretary of State, who must often talk to himself and find money from his left pocket for his right pocket to balance the provision of services in Wales. The Under-Secretary of State looks worried, not just because he has lost die paper with which he will respond to the debate, but because he will be called to account by doctors, other who work in the Health Service and the people of Wales if he fails to accept this sensible and modest amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales has a variety of needs of the Health Service. There is a clarity of objection to these clauses and a clarity of requirements that call for comprehensive planning rather than die fragmentation that the Bill will cause. Please, today, will the Minister listen to us, accept the amendment and allow doctors, health workers, health authorities and the Welsh people to breathe a huge sign of relief at die end of our debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As an outsider looking in, the points that have been made seem to be correct. As a Scot, I look with more than a little passing curiosity at what is happening generally in Wales. The attitude has changed in Scotland. The Government have moved away from the consensual style, and trying to keep the Scots happy, which has clearly failed. The hon.

One or two serious issues arise from similar observations that I made on some probing amendments in earlier sittings. Perhaps the Minister will respond to them. On an earlier occasion, in me context of England and Wales, there may have been some misunderstanding or confusion, which the BMA has brought to my attention, about me changes envisaged for rural dispensing committees. Perhaps the Welsh health Minister can clarify the issue in a specific Welsh context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said earlier, Wales does not have a regional tier. Everything in this respect is administered directly from the Welsh Office. What will happen when FPCs make decisions? Indeed, there was confusion about whether FPCs made recommendations to rural
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
dispensing committees or whether they made decisions. I believe that the response that I received from the Under-Secretary at the Department of Health in England may not have been entirely accurate. As Wales does not have a regional tier, will the Minister say how the future of rural dispensing committees will be affected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable and learned Friend the Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlisle) tabled a parliamentary question similar to those tabled by other Welsh Members. He told me that the Welsh Office has confirmed to him that apparently no units anywhere in the country were remotely interested in opting for the self-governing trust status. I believe that only four in Scotland are interested. In a United Kingdom context, that makes all the more apparent the complete inadvisability of the Bill. With respect to hon. Members repesenting English constituencies, if there is a great demand for the legislation from England. I should be happy to take Plaid Cymru's advice that the Government introduce it on a pilot basis in England. I suspect that if that were done the backlash would be similar to that arising from the pilot basis on which the poll tax was introduced in Scotland. We saw what happened there and now see what is happening in England. The Tory Back Benches are in some turmoil over that. I suspect that pilot schems would not necessarily be to the Government's advantage. They would be to the advantage of both Wales and Scotland as neither country has shown significant interest in the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the Welsh Office acts as judge and jury on funding, in contrast to the slightly different structure in England and Scotland. What guarantees can the Minister give that under the new regime adequate funding will be made for the Health Service, especially if the fears expressed early by the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) prove to be justified? Can the Minister reassure us? I rest my case, and am grateful to Welsh Members of me Committee for allowing this intrusion.

I conclude with the words of Lord Jenkins of Hillhead when he visited the Vale of Glamorgan by-election and commented on the furore over the Health Service reforms. There was a splendid intervention from the previous Secretary of State for Wales, now Lord Crickhowell, who is looking after our filthy water. My noble Friend hit the nail on the head about what appeared to be the general air of administrative incompetence in Wales at that time by die Welsh Office. He asked what one could expect from someone like Lord Crickhowell: it was a very pretty title for what appeared to be a deeply funereal man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I turn to the speeches of the hon. Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones). It was interesting to read in 	<i>Hansard</i> of 20 December 1989 the parliamentary answers given to the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). The hon. Gentleman is not present—perhaps he is busily engaged in helping AC AS with its inquiries. When he is not here we are usually told that the reason for his absence is that he is trying to solve the ambulance dispute. The hon. Gentleman has not published any of the answers that he was given on 20 December, and his reason for mat omission is most interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to columns 313-315, which give written answers about the Welsh Health Service that reveal how badly Wales was served by the Labour Government and how well it is served by the this Government. For instance, table (i) gives details of the NHS gross expenditure at constant 1988-89 prices. The comparison is easy to make because me figures cover five years under a Labour Government and ten years under a Conservative Government. In the five years of the Labour Government, spending in Wales rose by £76 million after inflation. Under the present Government me amount did not double but increased to £364 million in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Table (ii) gives details of hospital and community health services. Under the Labour Government, spending rose by £49 million in five years and under this Government the figure did not double but increased to £221 million in real terms. Between 1974 and 1979, taking the base year of 1978, expenditure went up by £8 million, but taking 1979-80, which was the last year of Labour planning, it reduced by £15 million in real terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the important points made by Opposition Members has been that one cannot trust the Government with me Health Service in Wales and that, if these clauses are allowed to stand part of me Bill, the Health Service in Wales will be financially worse off.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth pointing out that mere was reduction in spending on hospital and Community health services of £15 million in real terms between 1974 and 1979, whereas mere has been an increase of £18 million under this Government. Spending on family practitioner services went up by £32 million in real terms between 1974 and 1979 and by £101 million, three times as much, under the ten years of this Government. Finally, on centrally financed NHS gross expenditure, spending rose by £2.9 million in five years of the last Labour Government, but has gone up by £22 million in the ten years of this Conservative Government.

The reason why Labour Members, Welsh National Members and Liberal Members are fighting against the inclusion of these clauses is that they know that the clauses will bring about decentralisation of the Health Service, which is an important part of the Government's programme. We want to get away from a centralised bureaucracy. We want to give more choice to the people of Wales, more variety and more diversity in the provision of health services in Wales. That is what these clauses will give the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No hospital has yet made an application for hospital trust status. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Opposition Members may say "Hear, hear", but no school under the Education Reform Act made an application for grant-maintained status before the Act became law.

The question—whether we should allow GPs to run their own practices and have financial support and independence—is again a vital part of the Bill. Why should doctors in Wales be denied the opportunity to make mat choice? Nobody will force them; it will be their choice. We know that 36 practices in Wales have already expressed to the Welsh Office an interest in doing mat. Will Opposition Members deny those 36 practices the opportunity to run their own affairs if they wish to?

Every time we try to extend freedom of choice, every time we try to decentralise, every time we try to bring management down to the local level, the Labour party, which has been proclaiming for two years that it is the party of me consumer, the party of the small man and not the party of bureaucracy, reverts to type. The Labour party wants the NHS to be run from the centre, it wants no choice, no variety, no diversity, no experimentation. It wants the same, old, safe bureaucratic system, which has not worked to the benefit of patients in the past. We should reject the new clause and vote to give the people of Wales the opportunities that we are extending to the people of England and Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I remember this time last year being in agony in the hospital over the water and I certainly believe in the NHS, as do all my right hon. and honourable Friends. It is simply that we want to see it better, more accountable, more flexible and offering a better choice to those who work in it and to the patients.

The hon. Member for Ynys Mon spoke about trusts providing two-tier health. That is absolute rubbish. The hon. Gentleman does not understand that we hope, and believe, that they will act as pacemakers for the rest of the service, will show new ways to handle things and will set an example. In mat sense they will be two tier, but at present we have a two tier, three tier, four tier service, because everybody knows that in certain areas one obtains better treatment for this or that than in others. That is bound to happen because it is a 'human organisation. Therefore, me hon. Gentleman is raising an unnecessary scare. He and his hon. Friends fail to understand, or to make it clear to their constituents, that the district health authorities will be under a statutory duty to provide the best Health Service for their resident populations, whether it is in trusts, directly managed hospitals or the private sector.

The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) went into all those statistics, but he fore-bore to mention that the perinatal death figures in Wales are among the best in the country and sometimes have overtaken those in England as the result of a remarkable programme put in train under the Government. He forebore to talk about the inherited ill health in Wales, which has been tackled by the establishment of the health promotion authority for Wales and Heartbeat Wales, well ahead of England, which is now setting the pace for Europe in public health promotion. He said that cutting money was the aim of the Bill. That is rubbish. Our aim is to provide value for money, to make that money work to the best effect. We cannot possibly provide all the health services with all the modern machinery and drugs that we require for an

The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) asked for reassurances on funding. The Health Service has had an increase of 45 per cent in real funding under this Government. That is our pledge for the future. One cannot promise what will happen in five, ten or 15 years. The best pledge that one can give is from one's records, and my hon.

The proposals offer the people of Wales a chance to have a modern, flexible, answerable Health Service, in which the staff too will benefit.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 9 deals with complaints procedures. I am conscious that my hon. Friends will start complaining if the debate goes on too long. In earlier debates we touched on the appeals and complaints procedure. In cc. 1826 and 1059 my hon. Friend the Minister of State outlined her initial resistance to building into the Bill either an appeals procedure or a complaints procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper says about complaints procedures:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where these do not already exist, authorities should establish procedures for receiving comments and complaints from users of services. Procedures should be publicised. They will be an essential safeguard for users and will also act as an important monitoring and management instrument for social services authorities and service providers alike."</p></blockquote>
Basically, the argument is that if they are an essential safeguard for users, they should be written into the bill. Is it right to omit them and leave the matter to the discretion of the local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at other services provided by local authorities, one finds an appeal machinery built in. If someone is refused housing benefit, where it is a discretionary decision, there is an appeal procedure. I speak as a local Member, who has encouraged people to go through the appeal procedure; it ends up with councillors. That is a safeguard against someone getting the wrong decision from a relatively junior official. Likewise, in the education service, if one's child is allocated a school with which one is not happy, there is an appeal procedure, which again goes to councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The services that we are talking about are every bit as important as decisions on housing benefit, but at present there is no right to complain or appeal. Someone who applies for a service may simply be turned down and there is nothing he can do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the advice from Bill Utting to directors of social services. I understand the kind of procedure that it is hoped that local authorities will implement, but I wonder why we should not write it into the Bill and whether we are not leaving a little too much to goodwill. As the Bill is drafted, local authorities have no right to receive the necessary money to pay for community care; no one has a right to an assessment nor to services; no one has a right to appeal. At some
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
point one needs to consider the Bill and start to put obligations on people to provide the services that we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard the appeal process as something that will build up confidence in the system rather than being, to use my hon. Friend the Minister's words, a complex, cumbersome, bureaucratic process. People have rights and we are trying to give them those rights and services, but present they have no redress. I assume that the local government ombudsman will be entitled to investigate complaints of maladministration, so they will have that, but that takes a long time, as we have all discovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will reflect on her initial decision not to write into the Bill any complaints or appeals procedure, simply leaving it to the common sense of local authorities. The rights at stake are important and we must ensure that people have a right to insist on the services that we are trying to give them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the helpful new clause tabled by the hon. member for Ealing, Action (Sir G. Young) and the manner in which he moved it. It is substantially similar to an amendment that I moved last week and gives rise to the same considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two brief points. First, in response to me in an earlier debate the Minister of State spoke about not wanting to put items like the right to appeal oq the face of the Bill because of the extra bureaucracy that it would inevitably generate. Although it doubtless has a bureaucratic dimension, as does any other requirement that we want to build in for local authorities to uphold, surely as the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton has just argued, the right of appeal should not hinge on the degree of bureacracy that it would involve. In natural justice, the right to appeal is an important right in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton said that, if we do not put an item like this into the Bill but leave it to the discretion of local authorities we all know what will happen. Local authorities are not perfect and will not always carry out the duties that Ministers, in speeches, say they would like them to carry out but which are not statutory duties. That will happen for good reasons and for bad—sometimes because they are simply too pressed in other departments to be able to carry out as wide a range of services or uphold as wide a range of rights as I suspect hon. Members on both sides would like to see or because they will simply not bother. They will not rate such an item as a high priority because it will mean work for them and criticism of them, with the decisions that have been taken having to be reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On both philosophical and practical grounds, it is a good new clause, and certainly the spirit of it should commend itself to the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the fact that my hon. Friend the member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) referred to the mention of complaints in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1265</span>
White Paper. Three other paragraphs, 5.15, 5.16 and 5.10 also mention that the complaints procedures are to be part of the plans for community care issued by the local authority. There is a further reference to including a clearly defined and well-publicised complaints system. I am glad that my hon. Friend has read the detailed project being undertaken by the social services inspectorate, working with others, to provide guidance for establishing projects which will be monitored and to ensure that local authorities set up complaints procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's proposal has to do with an evolution in our welfare state. There was a time when patients, or clients, were regarded as passive recipients of care and services throughout health and welfare provision. Increasingly, we all believe that clients have rights and that their interests should be more thoroughly considered. That is fundamental to the ethos behind the White Paper. In addition, the caring at home initiative, to which I have already referred, specifically identifies effective, accessible and widely known arrangements for making suggestions, and complaints are one of the targets of the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and other hon. Gentlemen have heard me say on many occasions that certain amendments are not appropriate to be written into the Bill. The over-prescriptive tendancy of many hon. Members is likely to create a bureaucratic nightmare for those trying to implement policies at a time when we wish them to be innovative, creative and looking to the users, rather than to the guide book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, in this circumstance and not wishing precisely to follow the prescriptions of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, I take the view that, such is the importance of establishing a complaints procedure, such is our commitment and such is the work already being undertaken, it is right and proper to ensure that on the face of the Bill there is some mention of the importance of having a complaints procedure. With my hon. Friend's agreement, I shall come back at a later stage with more specific wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
