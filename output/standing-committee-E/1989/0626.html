	<div class='title'>TRANSFER OF SECURITIES: ABOLITION OF STAMP DUTY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Derby, South): I beg to move amendment No. 252, in page 74, line 21 after "capital", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which are quoted on a recognised stock exchange".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this, we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 253, in page 74, line 22 after "of", insert "such".</p>
	<p>No. 254, in page 74, line 25, after "of", insert "such".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:This is the first two sets of probing amendments that seek to restrict the scope of the clause, which aims to abolish stamp duty on the transfer of securities. It is argued that stamp duty should be abolished because the transfer of securities in London would be rendered potentially uncompetitive compared with the regime in other countries and on other exchanges. I say "potentially uncompetitive" because many suggested changes to regimes and exchanges in other countries have not yet occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument was used when the Finance Act 1988 abolished capital duty. We were told that that was necessary to preserve the competitiveness of London as an exchange, because our competitor countries would be seeking to abolish such duties. But from examining a recent summary, I believe that the majority of our competitor countries retain some form of capital duty. So although we are told that stamp duty or the equivalent tax will be abolished elsewhere, that has not yet happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
Many of the rest of the G7 countries still have the equivalent of stamp duty or other duties on share transactions. They have some form of direct tax on the transfer, purchase and sale of securities. Such duties are varied and levied at different rates. There is a case for suggesting that on the whole, where comparable duties arise elsewhere, they are often charged at lower rates. That does not alter the fact that those duties exist and seem likely to continue. The only place where the possibility of abolition is known to have arisen is Germany. However, I have been unable to confirm that abolition is likely to happen in the near future anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to whether other countries are abolishing stamp duty, there is the question of whether retaining it would render London uncompetitive. A report earlier this month suggested that, according to pension fund indicators from Phillips and Drew Fund Management Ltd, London is the cheapest stock market in the world. Our costs are lower than those in other major financial centres and in some respects, the difference is quite substantial. The Government will probably argue that London will have an even greater price advantage if stamp duty is abolished, as proposed. Nevertheless, the resulting reduction of costs may be partly offset by other changes. The question remains whether such is necessary to ensure London's competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is argued that international competitiveness requires the abolition of stamp duty, there may be the potential for ensuring that we do not lose our international competitiveness, without also losing all the revenue that presently accrues from stamp duty, by introducing a provision similar to the amendments in this group which would restrict abolition to quoted shares. I recognise that that would be less simple than wholesale abolition. Can the Minister identify the different revenue consequences of that type of abolition an opposed to wholesale abolition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that you, Mr. Cormack, will readily understand how reluctant I am, as any shadow Chief Secretary would be, to see £800 million or £900 million of Governent revenue drift in towards the horizon. We are anxious to retain some of that revenue for future use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have been asked to reveal my intentions with regard to adjourning. I am told that there is considerable interest among members of the Committee in world affairs today. Therefore, I propose to have quarter of an hour's break only at 7 pm for the Division in the House and then come straight back in the hope that we can move a different resolution by 8 pm. That would allow members of the Committee to satisfy their interest in world affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) made a cogent case for the amendments. She began by saying that when we abolished capital duties, we claimed that we were doing so because others on the continent would be doing likewise. In fact, all capital duties in the European Communmity must go by 1 January 1993 under the capital movements directive to which we—and everybody else—have assented. Sooner or later we will be followed by others and it is as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
well to be ahead of the game—as we so often are in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that Germany is the only country that has stated that it will abolish the equivalent of our stamp duty. Current indications are that Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland will all have achieved abolition by January 1993 at the latest. There is a compelling reason for us to do so in the time that we have described because stramp duty is a duty on paper transactions and the stock market is moving to paperless transactions. We would, therefore, have to introduce a wholly new tax to replace it if we wished to continue receiving that revenue from that form of transaction. We believe that it is in the interests of London and the country not to retain such a tax when others are moving in a different direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not another reason why we want to abolish stamp duty? If we seriously believe in extending share ownership, that will reduce the cost of buying shares for small shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is absolutely right: abolition of stamp duty is of benefit to all savers—small savers and those investing through institutions. Stamp duty is ultimately a tax on savings, so its abolition is beneficial to savings and forms a natural part of the Budget for savers. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me of that and giving me an opportunity to reaffirm it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm the figure for the effect of abolition given by my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Becket)? At the end of her contribution she said that the value of the abolition to the markets was £800 million or £900 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The figure is absolutely correct, but, as I said, the benefit goes to savers. There is a yield foregone of some £800 million or £900 million. The effect of the amendment would be to reduce that cost; in other words, to retain revenue of up to £100 million. The amendments woud retain stamp duty on private company shares and, by implication, shares of companies traded on the unlisted securities market and the third tier market. So far as stamp duty is concerned, those shares should be available to purchasers on the same footing as listed securities. There is no case for singling out unlisted securities for less favourable treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Keeping the duty for transfers of shares in those companies would make settlement of the transactions unwelcome to dealers and the stock exchange who would not wish to run parallel systems for stampable and non-stampable shares. That would make life difficult for companies wishing to obtain a listing. It would be wrong to impede their access to the market in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we are not attracted to the amendments. We believe that if stamp duty is to be abolished, it should naturally be abolished on securities, whether listed or unlisted—or, as the amendment says, quoted or unquoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I listened to the Minister to hear whether he could give any valid reason
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
for such a huge handout to an insignificant number of people by reducing their tax liability. He confirmed the figure given by my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) when she said that the total annual cost would be £800 million to £900 million. Therefore, I support my hon. Friend and there are four reasons for my doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am a member of the Select Committee on Social Services which is making recommendations to the Government on the introduction of care in the community. The sum is equivalent to 80 per cent. of the cost of introducing those changes. Secondly, it is about 15 per cent. of the sale price of the electricity supply industry. Thirdly, it is three and a half times the total money allocated for special projects for the homeless by the Secretary of State for the Environment last week. Fourthly, it is about two and a half times the cost of uprating child benefit to levels that will help alleviate the poverty experienced by so many people in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an appalling waste of resources that could be allocated elsewhere, and comes at a time when Ministers are wringing their hands as they argue with the Treasury about budgets or the introduction of new legislation, such as care in the community. It makes no sense for Ministers to say that resources for expansion or for implementing special assistance for the homeless and for those in the poverty trap are limited, when the Financial Secretary can in a few moments, dismiss amendments that would reallocate or retain resources for such projects. Instead, he will allow them to be frittered away on the very small group of people who will benefit from the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appalling that the Minister can advance so few genuine arguments in aid of the proposals, given that in a few weeks he will probably reveal that there will be serious shortfalls in the resources allocated to important projects. Those projects will have to be funded by local government or other organisations when the National Health Service and Community Care Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must rethink his priorities about the use of tax revenues. He sets aside glaring anomalies, and ignores the need to allocate resources to the low paid and to those involved in care in the community. The general principles of that Bill received support from both sides of the House, but it must be implemented with the proper resources to ensure that the elderly get the care to which the Bill entitles them. The £800 million would be better spent on that than on the abolition of duty that the Government propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) has made an important speech. When we are given figures for revenue foregone through the concessions offered by the Government, we are entitled to measure them against the yardstick of the other standards that obtain elsewhere in the public expenditure system. The clause involves a total of £800 million or £900 million. That sum equates to the entire positive expenditure proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry for industrial and regional support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
The concession can be regarded as a massive form of revenue support for a particular industrial activity. I do not discount the City's importance to the British economy or to employment. But to recognise that the City plays an important part in Britain's industry and balance of payments does not preclude consideration of whether the huge subsidy that the clause offers to a limited range of economic and industrial activities is worthwhile. The Minister said that savers will benefit, although he knows that there are grave problems in the City—fee incomes are falling, as are the profits earned by broking firms and the conglomerates that have taken over from them. Even if we considered than an industrial subsidy was correct, what assurance will the Minister give that its benefits will be felt by the savers to whom he has alluded and not simply used to pad the falling profits of the firms involved in the markets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) mentioned that this figure was less than the cost of many items of public expenditure, which is correct. Public expenditure costs a great deal. However, I could well say that it is less than a twentieth of Philips and Drew's estimate of the extra spending that the Labour party will require, or less than a fiftieth of the Midland Montague estimate of the money that it will require to pay for the extra spending that the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has let slip through her fingers in the form of pledges. I can understand that Labour Members are grasping around for every extra tax that they can find.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Martlew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which of the two estimates does the Minister believe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I suspect that the figure is probably somewhere in that range.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Minister, who is reponsible for the nation's money, says that he believes that the figure is somewhere between £20 billion and £50 billion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Between £5 billion and £50 billion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Sorry. The figure is between £5 billion and £50 billion. Surely a Treasury Minister, who has responsibility for public funds, should be more precise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Unfortunately I cannot, as I am not reponsible for Labour party policy. The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) might be able to enlighten the hon. Gentleman, and indeed enlighten the nation. It is because she and her party have not done so that several institutions have felt it necessary to do these calculations themselves in order to advise their clients I mentioned Phillips and Drew simply because the hon. Lady said that it was a reliable source of information. The firm stated that the underlying cost of transactions in London was one of the cheapest in the world, which is most desirable. Clearly we do not wish to add to that and render it uncompetitive by imposing a tax which will often add more than 100 per cent to the underlying cost of the transaction. In New York there is no stamp duty, so we are already in strong competition with one market where the duty does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
However, my main point is that of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), that we are helping investors and institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I wonder whether my hon. Friend thinks that he is perhaps stretching the credulity of the Committee when he suggests that a socialist party could enlighten the country or even the Committee. When has socialism ever enlightened a nation anywhere in the free world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I must plead guilty to that thought, and I apologise to the Committee for my rash exaggeration. However, I am ever-hopeful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Makerfield suggested that the measure would help only a small number of people. I have to inform him that tens of millions of savers save in a form which will benefit from this reduction. That sum of money will go towards increasing the value of their life assurance commitments, pension funds and future pension entitlement. That is a very desirable development that will have the overwhelming support of the Committee, though I am sure that the Opposition wish to increase rather than reduce taxation on savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is interesting that the Government are using a scattergun approach on taxation and benefits to ensure that the money goes to the people in real need. If the Government are really interested in shareholders, they should consider one group of share holders who are under extreme difficulty at present—those involved in shares in the Britsh construction industry, particularly in the house building sector. If these resources were used for special projects for the homeless, if a significant non-inflationary increase in development in the private sector and the construction of these projects were undertaken—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. Analogies are fine, but we are now going wide of the issue. We are not here to debate the needs of the construction industry, but to debate the amendment moved with admirable elequence and conciseness by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked whether we could be sure that the remission of tax would benefit savers rather than be absorbed by institutions at a time of excess capacity. As an economist, he will appreciate that at times of excess capacity it is all the more likely that costs will be passed on to the consumer and the customer—in this case, the saver—rather than be absorbed by the industry and the middle man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:We should set the record straight. The Minister strayed into talking about "imposing" a tax, but none of us are talking about that. We are talking about whether to abolish a tax. It is a subtle but important distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. friends the Members for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney and for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), I could not help but notice the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
casualness with which the Minister waved aside a mere £100 million of revenue. That hardly inspires confidence in the Government as custodians and stewards of the public purse. Moreover, my lack of confidence was reinforced by the Minister's casualness in talking about expenditure "in that range", meaning any amount between £5 billion and £50 billion. Fortunately, the Opposition are not so casual. We deplore throwing resources away for no better reason that what the Minister described as "not singling out" unquoted shares for less favourable treatment. In such circumstances, we would be lacking in our duty if we did not make the gesture of pressing the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 255, in page 74, line 26 at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Subsection (1) shall not apply where the instrument transfers more than 5 per cent of any defined security then in issue, or is executed as part of or in connection with any arrangements the probable result of which will be the making of such a transfer".</p></blockquote>
This amendment follows directly from the preceding group. It is similarly a probing amendment. We seek to limit abolition of the duty to where the transfer involves less than 5 per cent of the share capital of the company. In other words, the amendment seeks to exclude companies involved in takeovers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often stamp duty is the only substantial tax collected on major takeovers. I hope that the Minister will clarify what the revenue implications are. However, there is a wider more general anxiety in financial circles about the extent to which our allowance of takeovers encourages a short-term approach. Some believe that it causes our real economy serious difficulties in comparison to our competitors.

If stamp duty is the only tax collected on major takeovers, it is implicit that lifting it will have some undesirable impact, though the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would regard it as useful. We are worried about the revenues and the encouragement of short-termism, which we believe is undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We touched on the impact of abolition. The revenue lost will be substantial—the equivalent of about ½p or 1p on basic rate tax. We want to limit those losses, if it is practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I understand the purpose of the amendment, but it is wrong in principle and would be unworkable in practice. I shall not stress the arguments of principle because there is not much force either way. Stamp duty does not inhibit, and its abolition would not encourage takeovers. There is no reason to protect companies from takeovers if their shareholders wish to change the management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important, it would be almost impossible to administer the scheme. The amendment recognises that merely charging transfers of more than 5 per cent will not work because numerous transfers of smaller percentages would achieve the same result. The second part of the amendment tries to cope with the problem by targeting transfers in connection with arrangements that are likely to lead to the acquisition of 5 per cent. Those criteria are impossibly vague to apply in practice. A company registrar needs to know whether a transfer should or should not be stamped before he registers it. For any substantial purchase of shares, he could not know whether or not it fell within the terms of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abolution of the duty on shares has been widely welcomed and to maintain the charge for a largely unidentifiable class of transfers would be absurd and impractical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:If I might gently advise the Minister, he would have been better to stick to saying that the amendment is unworkable in practice. To suggest that something is wrong in principle and finish by saying that it would not make much difference, is a use of words that might better be saved for a more substantial argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to his observations. I shall consider and read them to discover whether there are any counter-arguments that we may want to advance. I would not press an amendment that is unworkable in practice. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:These amendments raise the issue of conditional contracts. The Bill deals with them inconsistently, as between clause 92(7) and clause 94(2)(a), which deals with what I always want to call stamp duty revenue tax, but the Minister will know what I mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Stamp duty reserve tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Yes. Clause 94(2)(a) makes the tax no longer chargeable when a taxable conditional agreement is made before the abolition day and the condition is satisfied afterwards. Clause 92(7) provides that tax ceases to be payable only where the conditional contract is made after abolition day. To be consistent, surely it should cease to be payable where the agreement is made before the abolition day and the condition is satisfied afterwards. The amendments would do that. Does the Minister agree that they would solve a problem or can he explain why they are unnecessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Lady has put her finger on a difficult distinction between SDRT and stamp duty. I am reasonably confident that the treatment in the clause is correct, but it is arguable that we could have dealt with it somewhat in the manner suggested in the amendment. However, I understand that only a few people would be affected if we move in one way, whereas if we line up the two treatments in the other direction significant sums would be lost. To accept the amendment would cost up to £100 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to explain this arcane matter. Under clause 92(7) a transfer pursuant to a contract, whether conditional or not, made before abolition day is chargeable to stamp duty. Paragraph (b) of amendment No. 251 would change the provision so that a transfer pursuant to a conditional contract made before abolition day would be exempt from stamp duty if the condition is satisfied after that day. The basis for this proposed change is that it would bring the stamp duty rule in line with the stamp duty reserve tax rule in clause 94(2)(a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the stamp duty rule in clause 92 and the SDRT rule in clause 94 reflects a basic difference between the two taxes. SDRT is a tax on agreements to transfer chargeable securities. It follows that no charge should arise in respect of a conditional agreement until the condition is satisfied: section 87(3)(a) of the Finance Act 1986 provides for that. Therefore, where the condition is satisfied after abolition day it would be wrong for the tax to apply to the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stamp duty position is different. Stamp duty is a duty on documents rather than an agreement and the documents here are transfers of shares on sale. In determining for stamp duty which transfers on sale are to fall on either side of the abolition line, we decided to follow the precedent of 1986, when the duty was halved. The effect of clause 92 is that a transfer will fall within the stamp duty charge if the date of the contract for sale is before abolition day. In this context there is no need to consider whether such a contract is conditional or not as the amendment proposes. If it is conditional and the condition is never satisfied, no transfer will result and no duty will be payable. If it is satisfied, there is no case for distinguishing the transfer from one completing an unconditional agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I hope that my explanation has clarified this arcane point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should like to speak to amendment No. 248.I am not sure whether it deals with the same point as amendment No. 250, tabled by the learned Member or Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment deals with a minor point that was identified in the Law Society's submission and was drafted for me by Price Waterhouse, to whom I am an adviser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause is drafted, where stamp duty reserve tax has been paid before abolition of stamp duty but the contract effectively straddles abolition day so that the transfer of the shares takes place after abolition day, I understand that even if SDRT had been paid before abolition day it would still be necessary to pay stamp duty after that day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I must admit that I thought that the purport of my hon. Friend's amendment No. 248 was different and that he was worried about the six-year rule rather than abolition. As I have analysed the amendment under a misapprrehension, it may be better to write to him rather than continue with an analysis that is somewhat askew.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The misunderstanding may have arisen because the Law Society proposed a different solution from mine. It pointed out that, in certain circumstances, charges to both stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax can apply, which amounts to double taxation on the same transaction. That happens when a contract is entered into and completed more than six years after the contract is made. Stamp duty reserve tax is payable in respect of the contract. Stamp duty is payable on the subsequent transfer, but the stamp duty reserve tax cannot be reclaimed after a six-year delay. Such contracts are being made and, as a result, purchasers of shares are required to pay both stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax. As this point is technical, it would be a good idea for my hon. Friend to write to me about it, and, if necessary, we can return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:These are all technical points and various difficulties arise from them. Although I am not entirely convinced by the Minister's reply, I do not wish to cost the figures to which the Minister referred.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:This is not a subsidy. Tax relief on mortgage interest payable is a subsidy, as is tax relief on contributions to pension schemes.

There is no question of subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is appropriate that someone associated with accountancy should involve us in mystical considerations, and say that not paying a tax is different qualitatively from feeling the benefit of a specific subsidy or relief. In commonsense terms, the two are identical. The Minister did not attempt to conceal that. He said that the City was being offered a concession to keep it competitive with other great financial and economic centres. He was clear about that and did not engage in logic-chopping mysticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They would reduce the employer contribution provided that they were happy with that.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Subsidies are being stripped away from industries in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle and in other constituencies in the north of England.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that savers will benefit. No one can pretend that the bulk of the transactions on the stock market which are being relieved of stamp duty are carried out by individual, private shareholders. Only a tiny proportion are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many small savers in the north of England will benefit from the measure? They will be encouraged to invest in the stock market because they will not have an extra cost on their transactions. While there may not be as many small savers as we should like now, the abolition of the tax will encourage more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am attracted by the idea that, tonight, in the West Jesmond British Legion club in my con-

Members: "hear, hear."] I have given a small plug to a good regional stockbroking firm to show my lack of prejudice and I hope that Conservative Members will take careful note of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a realistic picture. The bulk of transactions that we are considering affect not individuals, but great financial institutions. The element of individual saving and contribution is socialised and collectiv-ised through unit trusts and other means. Even though the relief is considered necessary and a better way to spend public money than creating an enterprise zone in Tunbridge Wells or putting former employees of James Capel on employment training, what assurance is there that the benefit of the reduced transaction costs will be passed on to the notional individual small saver, the mythical figure that has been used as a justification for this? The answer is that no serious justification or guarantee can be offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will remove an important tax on the City. I accept the point about paperless trading. To continue, stamp duty would have to be rethought radically and presented in another way. We are losing the opportunity to consider those issues and are simply giving a vast subsidy to a tiny range of economic activities that employ 34,000 people. I shall register that point by voting against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:First, I shall raise a rather arcane point with the Minister, so that he may have time to consider his reply, and then go on to the major issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In several other stamp duty codes, such as the one prevailing in France, because of the differential in rates of duty between transfers of shares and of land, transfers of shares of companies, which are their shells for holding land, are treated as transfers of the underlying land. It has been suggested that the abolition of stamp duty on share transfers may tempt some people to create moneybox companies with land, if corporation tax consequences allow that. Have the Government considered that and devised any plans to counter it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) posed admirable questions about the rationale and consequences of the clause. Four simple questions arise. First, why should we abolish stamp duty or SDRT? Secondly, why should we do it now? Thirdly, who will benefit from that? Fourthly—and perhaps most significantly—who will pay for it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government give the following reasons for abolishing stamp duty—London would become more competitive, the advent of TAURUS and the benefit that would accrue to small shareholders. I have mentioned differential costs already. The Bill does not tackle the efficiency and speed of settlements, which, it has been suggested, are at least as important as the level of stamp duty. Germany has accepted that and it was suggested in the City that Britain would experience competitive difficulty because the German exchange expects to achieve a vastly greater speed of settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did all transfers attract stamp duty? Those who held bearer shares, American depository receipts or shares
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
in the recognised European clearing system on which the season ticket had been paid, did not pay further duty. Transactions took place that did not attract stamp duty. If it is necessary to forgo such large sums of revenue because London may become uncompetitive, why not abolish stamp duty and SDRT now? Why is the provision linked to the advent of TAURUS?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDRT was introduced in 1986 as a consequence of the decision to lower the rate of stamp duty. It was taken as a means of widening the base on which the tax was charged in order—with the assumption of increased turnover—to make the overall package of changes revenue neutral and to compensate for the reduction in the rate of stamp duty. The tax on agreements to transfer shares and actual transfer documents was introduced under SDRT. The Minister and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) claimed that abolition was necessary because of TAURUS—my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central referred to that argument—but the Government amended SDRT as late as last year. They claimed that they had done so to make it relevant to and operable under TAURUS. They did not suggest that the advent of TAURUS required the abolition of SDRT. The Chief Secretary, who was then Financial Secretary, said last year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With the switch to paperless share dealing, stamp duty will no longer be payable … The main tax will therefore become stamp duty reserve tax".</p></blockquote>
So, with a system such as TAURUS, there may be difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister finished:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The basic purpose of the new clauses is to cover the move to the paperless system and adapting stamp duty reserve tax to that new world." —[Official Report, Standing Committee G, 20 June 1989; c. 577.]</p></blockquote>
The idea that TAURUS requires the abolition of these taxes, if it is valid, is certainly new. What has happened in the past year to make it necessary to abolish a tax that the Government so recently amended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to who will benefit. I mentioned that SDRT was introduced partly to take account of the revenue lost by reducing the rate of stamp duty. Here, however, there can be no extra income from turnover—there is no counter balancing change to the base. It will be a straight loss of revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his hon. Friends talked about the benefit that will accrue to the small shareholder. My hon. Friends then cast well-merited doubt on whether the small shareholder rather than the institutions will benefit. In the immediate aftermath of the Budget, Mr. Peter Leatherdale, a director of the National Investment Group, drew attention to the present costs for shareholders. He said that a shareholder who bought shares costing £5,000 would pay £62.50 commission and £25 stamp duty. Even when the stamp duty is removed, that saving is cast into the shade by other costs. Mr. Leatherdale pointed out that that saving would have to be set against "the steady upward trend" of brokers' minimum commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the abolition of stamp duty on share dealings was announced, the press pointed out that the biggest beneficiaries would be the institutions rather than indi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
viduals and suggested that the insurance industry might beneift by about £40 million. That implies that large institutions will benefit more than small shareholders, who may not benefit at all if the saving is swallowed up by increased costs. The third group of beneficiaries will be overseas investors who now contribute to our revenues through stamp duty but who might not contribute in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listed those who will benefit, I come to who pays. There is little doubt that someone has to pay, judging from the observations of the Minister's predecessor in 1983. The present Secretary of State for Energy was then a Treasury Minister and produced a report on stamp duty which considered the arguments for stamp duty reform. There has been a long-running campaign for its abolition. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be recognized that the loss of nearly £1,000 million of revenue will never be easy to bear."</p></blockquote>
In the report on the ending of stamp duty produced by the Adam Smith Institute, which was published last year, Mr. Nicholas Gibb quoted the observations of the present Secretary of State for Energy and said that the argument was no longer valid because—
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1983 the British economy had not yet fully benefited from the economic policies introduced by the present government and so such a loss of revenue could not be risked."</p></blockquote>
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, although in 1983 the position regarding inflation, the balance of payments and interest rates was rather different from and, to the untutored eye such as mine, superior to the present one, the Government have decided that revenue whose loss could not easily be borne in 1983 can be whistled down the wind in 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more recently than the observations made in 1983 are the remarks of the hon. Member for Hertford-shire, North (Mr. Stewart) who served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury. On a call for the abolition of stamp duty as it existed in 1986, the right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not fair, either to the Committee or to the City, for the hon. Gentleman to say that one can do away with stamp duty painlessly, and that it does not have to be substituted by an alternative form of revenue."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we felt that it would be quite wrong to call on another part of the economy to produce the £600 million" —</p></blockquote>
as the sum was then—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make up the difference." —[Official Report, Standing Committee G, 5 June 1986; c. 355]</p></blockquote>
As I have already said, that argument held some sway with the Government as late as last year, when they were adapting, rather than abolishing, SDRT. In that fuller context, will the Minister tell us why the Government now intend to abolish stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax? Why does he feel that he can discard revenue that his predecessors, in a more favourable economic climate, felt that they could not disregard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) said that if a subsidy of £800 million on the shipbuilding industry, for example,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
where being abolished, there would be much interest in such a measure and much opposition to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bea-consfield (Mr. Smith). If there were an £800 million tax on the shipbuilding industry, specific and discriminatory, I should probably want to abolish it and, when I did, I would not say that I was creating a subsidy. Furthermore, if the shipbuilding industry moved from making ships to making hovercraft and the tax had to be dismantled, a new one being created to clobber, hovercraft, I should be extremely reluctant to do that. We are in a similar situation. The City is moving away from transactions involving paper, which has to be stamped and incurs stamp duty, to dematerialised trading. We would have to create a whole new tax structure to cope with that. It is in that context that this change is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) asked four pertinent questions—why should we abolish stamp duty, why should we abolish it now, who benefits and who pays? Before I respond to those points, I should like to deal with her question about the possible securitisation of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already a marked difference between the stamp duty on property and that on securities, so people have an incentive to securitise property, as the hon. Lady fears may happen. They do not seem to be doing that, but we shall keep our eyes open. The possibility of such action has not escaped our notice and it is sensible of the hon. Lady to be alert to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked why we should abolish stamp duty. There is a change taking place through the introduction of TAURUS. To require the new TAURUS regime, which should be facilitated, to incorporate a new system of taxation would be a burden. There is also the prospect our EC partners and competitors abolishing similar taxes. There is a draft directive that would require all countries to do that, although its adoption would depend on an unanimous decision. Above all, the change will encourage and reward savers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duty will not be abolished immediately. It will be abolished when TAURUS is introduced, which is expected to be on 1 January two years hence. The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) asked who would benefit from the change. The answer is savers, and those who invest in securities. About 20 per cent. of the benefits of abolition will go directly to individual shareholders who do not use intermediaries. About 70 per cent. by number of Stock Exchage transactions are carried out for private, not institutional, clients, although the latter account for a greater volume in value terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Would the Minister be kind enough to recalibrate those figures in terms of volume of transactions rather than by number?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:As I was saying when the hon. Gentleman intervened, I accept that, measured by value, most transactions are carried out by institutions, but they are carried out on behalf of the millions of people who have life assurance contracts, pension arrangements and investments in unit trusts. In addition, grow-
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
ing number of people have personal equity plans and many more have become direct shareholders as a result of the Government's encouragement of individual share ownership by means of the privatisation programme. The measure will spread benefit more widely than almost any other provision in the Budget. That is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor does the hon. Member for Derby, South seem to realise that the abolition of stamp duty cannot increase other dealing costs. The introduction of TAURUS should reduce them. Other things being equal, facilitating TAURUS's introduction will leave small shareholders better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady suggested that the proposal conflicts with statements made in 1983. She spoke about the £1 billion of duty that would have been foregone if stamp duty had been abolished then, and referred to the comments made at the time by my right hon. Friend, now the Secretary of State for Energy. I remind the hon. Lady that my right hon. Friend was talking about the total yield of stamp duty on all forms of transactions. That yield was then £1 billion. We are talking now about the yield from stamp duty on securities. Although the rate is a fraction of what it was in 1983, the total is also nearly £1 billion. That demonstrates how the economy's growth and prosperity has brought a high yield. Even after abolition of stamp duty on securities, we shall still obtain more from stamp duty than we did in 1983, and at a lower rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a lesson for the Opposition that reduction of taxes increases yield because of the economy's greater buoyancy. Perhaps the best form of reduction is abolition, and we are glad that this major tax will join the list of others that have been abolished by the Government as a contribution to the well-being of the population, by encouraging savers and improving prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not sure whether my wording is at fault or the Minister failed to follow my argument. Of course, I realise that abolishing stamp duty will not increase costs. I merely asked whether something else might expand to fill the space left by its abolition—other cost increases. It is not absolutely clear whether savings for the small shareholder will be as automatic as the Minister assumes. In fairness, the Minister said, "All things being equal", but usually they are not—especially under this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also mentioned his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy in 1983, who referred to the overall take from stamp duty. Of course I recognise that he was referring to overall levels and that the Bill will only abolish part of it. I also recognise that buoyancy contributes to increased revenues from taxation. I shall pass lightly over the fact that inflation often makes its own contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although £900 million or so of revenue may not be worth its 1983 value, it should not be sneezed at. Opposition Members, prudent and responsible as we are, consider that amount to be quite substantial. The Minister implied that not abolishing the tax now effectively disposes of the question why we have these clauses before us. On the contrary, it merely highlights the question.

If the Government believe that we may need to abolish stamp duty reserve tax in one or two years time, why not introduce relevant clauses into the Finance Bill of the appropriate year? Why pass them and have them on the statute book now, when they may not be needed for a considerable time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry that I did not make an important point clear. The reason for the announcement now is to save the huge cost that would be incurred if the whole TAURUS system had to be developed to take on an entirely new tax. The legislation should be put on the statute book in advance. It will save a huge amount of wasted effort on the part of many people. That is why the announcement is being made now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I take the Minister's point and recognise that it is more substantial than the possibility that the Chancellor wanted to brighten up a dull Budget. Nevertheless, I remain wary, as I have had experience of the Government's advance gestures, which we often live to regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only about two years ago, the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), as Chancellor of the Exchequer, decided to review the Treasury supplement to the national insurance fund, which he had been steadily raiding to fund tax cuts, yet he ended up by proposing to abolish the fund altogether so that no future Chancellor could use the mechanism again. I well recall how we pleaded with Ministers not to take such a step, warning them that they might live to regret it. I admit that they had the foresight to recognise that they would indeed regret it the following year, but they had to engage in some shady manoeuvres with the redundancy fund to get themselves out of a pit that they had dug themselves. I hope that they will not now dig a similar pit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Minister's logic on clause 92 will lead him, if not to accept the amendment, at least to accept its principle. We seek retrospectively to exempt an agreement from SDRT where the stamp duty could not have become payable in cases that would not be covered by the clause. The tax was introduced to cover cases where an agreement was made to do something which, if properly documented, might have given rise to a stamp duty liability. It seems reasonable to exclude SDRT when stamp duty could not have been charged even if full documentation had been prepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to cover cases where the transfer of security is agreed on unconditionally, which will not be common, and where that cannot take place before abolition day under the terms of the agreement. If the Minister feels that this is another technicality about which he wishes to write to us, I should be quite happy if he will write.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The issue is why the change is being made now. This clause refers to the appointed day. The Minister may have seen an article in 	<i>The Independent</i> on 19 June referring to a speech made by an associate director of the Bank of England to the Institute for International Research. It suggests that not only do the Government propose the abolition of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax and support the introduction of TAURUS, but that there is a direct link between the benefits that may accrue to the small shareholder from TAURUS and those that result from the abolition of the duty. The Chancellor perhaps intended his remarks to convey the information that abolition of the taxes was conditional on the introduction of TAURUS and that the appointed day would be linked with evidence that small shareholders will benefit from TAURUS. The burden of the rest of the article was that such a condition was not likely to be met. TAURUS will cause a sharp fall in the overall cost of share dealings. However, institutions will profit from a huge reduction in costs while private investors will get little benefit from it and may even suffer an increase in costs. The Minister should assure us that the oft-stated devotion of the Government to small shareholders is so great that, if TAURUS does not assist such shareholders in the way suggested, the taxes may not be abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I see from my writing on the copy of the article in front of me that, far from it having been drawn to my attention, I brought it to someone else's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured that the Bank of England did not intend that the inference drawn by 	<i>The Independent</i> should be made. There is no conditional element, such as that suggested in the article or urged by the hon. Lady, to relate the abolition of stamp duty to the introduction of TAURUS. We want the benefits of TAURUS to spread to all shareholders. Abolishing stamp duty will benefit small and large shareholders alike.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not nearly as interested in whether the associate director of the Bank of England was reported correctly as I am in discovering whether the Government's devotion to small shareholders is anything other than propaganda.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Amendment No. 214 would prevent the Board of Inland Revenue from issuing notices demanding information from taxpayers without having first satisfied a general or special appeal commissioner that the board is justified in using its powers. Section 20(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 allows the board to issue such notices without first having to satisfy an appeal commissioner that such action is appropriate. Other powers in section 20 require notices to be sent. Amendment No. 214 would bring all the powers into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 100, the United Kingdom must make all domestic information—gathering powers available to other EEC Revenue departments. Foreign Governments could require the Revenue to utilise section 20(2) on their behalf. That could put taxpayers to considerable extra expense and embarrassment, depending on the harshness of foreign tax rulings, without any right of appeal against the notice except by way of non-compliance or by challenging consequent penalty proceedings. It is argued that that is wrong. To achieve fairness and balance between taxpayers and the Revenue amendment No. 214 or amendment No. 215 should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 214, all section 20 notices would be subject to the prior consent of the appeal commissioner. Under amendment No. 215, the taxpayer would be able to appeal on the grounds that compliance with a notice would be unreasonably burdensome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope that the Government will not be tempted to give too ready a response on amendments Nos. 214 and 215. They seem to tie the hands of the Revenue too tightly. In a later Labour amendment we shall explore in greater detail issue of balance between the Revenue and taxpayer. The attempts of the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) to clarify the Government's thinking on this matter are not as helpful as his usual attempts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury(Mr. Richard Ryder)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The rhetoric of the hon.

Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I am terribly sorry, but it is extremely difficult to hear the hon. Member. It would be helpful if he would raise his voice a decibel or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With regard to amendment No. 214, most notices requesting taxpayers to provide information are issued by inspectors. Such notices are already subject to the prior approval of an independent appeal commissioner, but there are certain serious cases where the delay in obtaining a commissioner's approval could prejudice the Revenue's ability to secure any tax at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why this special power allows the Board of Inland Revenue to issue a notice on its authority. That power can be exercised only by the board, not by individual taxpayers. The board has always used that power, which until now has been unrestricted by the law, with restraint and only in very small numbers for serious cases. However, the possibility exists that unless the restriction is made explicit in the statute, it might, in future, be used in less serious cases particularly in complying with our obligation to provide information to EC authorities, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury pointed out, it is important to strike a balance between the rights of the taxpayer and the powers of the Inland Revenue. When we debate the Opposition's amendment, I shall argue that, by taking a position between that of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke and the Opposition, the Government have got the balance right. Clause 79 would achieve a balance by limiting to the most serious cases the Revenue's power to obtain information without an appeal commissioner's approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 215, when the power to require details relating to an unnamed taxpayer, or group of taxpayers, was introduced as part of the implementation of the Keith committee recommendations in 1988, we recognised that it could place a substantial burden on third party information holders, such as banks, accountants and solicitors. Often, their records are indexed by reference to names and addresses and searching them for information that is not indexed could be lenghty and difficult. For example, they could be asked which of their customers or clients had invested with a particular financial institution. That is why the right to object to the Revenue if necessary, to the special commissioner was introduced. If the recipient of a notice feels that the request would place undue burdens on him, he may apply to have the request modified or cancelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only sensible and fair to safeguard third party interests in that way. There is no justification for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
extending the right to cases in which the recipients of notices are asked to provide details or documents relating to their own tax affairs or to those of one named person. In those cases, there is no reason to suppose that a request by the Inland Revenue would be unduly onerous. Other rights of appeal are available to taxpayers and third parties in such cases. They can appeal directly to the courts by judicial review or by an action for a declaration that a notice is invalid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present procedures have been in place for many years and have caused no problems in practice. Last year my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) proposed a similar amendment in the Finance Bill Committee. He was persuaded that it would not be appropriate to allow a direct right of appeal in such cases, but my right hon. Friend the then Financial Secretary, now the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, promised to consult the representative bodies most directly affected and to consider whether additional safeguards were necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue's subsequent inquiries confirmed that the present long-standing safeguards were working satisfactorily. My hon. Friend the present Financial Secretary wrote to my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South to say that, in view of the Revenue's findings, he did not propose to introduce further safeguards. He gave a firm undertaking, which I am happy to repeat here, that the matter would be kept under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of my explanation and the firm assurances which I set out today and which my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary stressed in his correspondence with my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I duly note the harmony of interests, outlook and thinking between my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). I simply cannot take on that combination, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 240, in page 67, line 19, leave out paragraphs (a) and (b) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the person to whom it relates has failed (or is likely at any time in the future to fail) to comply with any provision of the Taxes Act".</p></blockquote>
In his concluding remarks on the previous debate, the Economic Secretary said that the present arrangements had been in place for many years and had caused no problems in pratice. If so, what is the need for clause 79? If practices have gone well hitherto, why is a change necessary? The Government will probably try to argue that clause 79 institutes current practice in statutory form. However, we believe that the clause goes further than current practice. It restricts unnecessarily the practice currently operated by Inland Revenue and its powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause impinges on the Revenue's ability to require a taxpayer in certain circumstances to provide information relevant to his or her tax liability. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
clause effectively restricts voluntarily a power that the Revenue already has to combat tax avoidance or evasion. In present practice it is a general power, but it is only used in exceptionally serious circumstances. For example, to secure a section 20 notice requiring documents and information to be provided, a tax inspector must obtain both the board's authority and the consent of a commissioner of taxes who must be satisfied that proceedings are reasonable. A section 20 notice forces an individual to give information or produce documents relevant to any tax liability to which he may be subject. The board can issue a section 20 notice directly without a commissioner's consent, but it does that in practice only when there is suspicion of serious abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 79 would prevent that, unless two conditions were satisfied. First, the target taxpayer must be suspected of an actual or prospective failure to comply with the Taxes Acts. That is not a problem and we have no quarrel with it. Secondly, the board has to be satisfied that such failure, according to new subsection (7A)(b),
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"is likely to have led or to lead to serious prejudice to the proper assessment or collection of tax."</p></blockquote>
We are worried that that phrasing imposes a potentially very difficult duty on Inland Revenue. It is vague. What exactly is "proper assessent or collection" of tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the most classic tax avoidance case of all time—that of Rossminster. His alleged tax avoidance schemes amounted to about £100 million, a substantial sum, but it amounted to about only 0.1 per cent. of the United Kingdom exchequer's overall tax revenue. Under the clause, it would be possible for Rossminster to stand up in court and say that, because the alleged figures represented such a tiny proportion of overall tax revenue, there was no serious prejudice to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proper assessment or collection of tax."</p></blockquote>
That example is slightly facetious. Such a case would provoke counter-arguments. My intention is to illustrate that it is very difficult to define the wording in clause 79 so that Parliament can be certain that the courts will always make a proper and effective judgment. Amendment No. 240 would omit most of new subsection (7A)(b), but allow the board to retain almost all of its existing powers. Those powers are relatively wide and, in cases of serious potential fraud or avoidance, the board can be relied on to use them responsibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must draw attention to the Minister's remark that the power to require information has existed for many years. The Revenue has used that power responsibly and not intruded upon civil liberties or privacy, yet now the Government want to put that power in statutory form and impose a vague but possibly severe requirement on the Revenue to ascertain the likely prejudice to the proper assessment or collection of tax. That would tie the Revenue's hands unnecessarily, and bring no obvious gain to individuals or to taxpayers in general.

	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
enough, and we have complained about the inadequacies of their performance before—in the Finance Bills of the past two years to tighten up on tax avoidance and evasion. However, clause 79 shows a puzzling reversal of direction. We are worried that the Government may be removing powers from the Revenue that may be needed in cases of serious fraud or abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I cannot think of a case where the Inland Revenue has proposed a change to the Finance Bill that would have reduced its powers. I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury (Mr. Smith) that people will be given the opportunity to evade tax. Certainly the Revenue does not believe that, or it would not have advised that the clause was necessary. The hon. Gentleman anticipated that I would justify that necessity by referring to the need to clarify and simplify the law. That is one of the key reasons behind the clause's inclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must also take account of another factor, on which I shall elaborate in connection with clause 100. As I shall explain then, it is vital that our domestic legislation is brought into line with our obligations under a long-standing EC directive to obtain information for the revenue authorities in our partner countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause, in parallel with clause 100, brings the law into line with the way in which the board administers its information powers and practice. It ensures that the safeguards of taxpayers and third parties, which very properly apply in practice, are embodied in the statute book and apply equally to EC and domestic purposes. If I remember correctly, the directive to which I referred was introduced in 1977. It received the full-hearted support of the then Labour Government, and particularly the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon), who was then a Treasury Minister. they argued strongly in favour of the directive and I suggest to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury that it would therefore be wholly consistent for him to support the principles underlying this clause. His amendment would render the clause virtually redundant. It is the misfortune of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) that he moved his amendment before I had heard the arguments that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has put to us this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason for the clause is specifically to restrict the Board's present unfettered discretion to use the power in any investigation case, however small. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is used in only a handful of cases every year and I understand from the Revenue that there are about 10 cases a year. Removing the requirement that it be used only in cases where there is likely to be seirous prejudice to the proper assessment and collection of tax would, in effect, preserve the status quo. It would remove the reasonable safeguard that we think it is right to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the amendment is technically flawed. The Revenue's purpose in issuing an information notice is to discover the facts of a particular case. Although it will always have its suspicions before issuing a notice, it is normally only when it has those facts that it will be able to establish with any certainty that someone has failed to comply with the provisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
of the Taxes Acts. That is why the clause uses the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"may have failed … to comply with any provision of the Taxes Acts".</p></blockquote>
To provide that the board could issue a notice only in cases where it already had grounds for believing that someone has failed to fulfil obligations would place it in a Catch 22 situation. It would prevent it, in the majority of cases, from getting the information that it needed to ascertain whether someone had failed to comply with the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be a small cost flowing from the amendment in view of the fact that it is flawed. There would be no direct cost, but if, because of the technical flaw, it prevented the board from using its power, it would diminish the Revenue's ability to obtain tax, interest and penalties in certain large cases. It is not easy to put a figure on the possible resultant loss to the Exchequer, but far from tightening things up the amendment could cost the Exchequer as much as £10 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked two specific questions. First, he asked why the word "serious" is not defined. I am advised that "serious" is allowed to have its ordinary meaning. That follows the precedent in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984—I believe that the hon. Gentleman sat on the Committee that considered the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill—which similarly leaves the word "serious" undefined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second question was what "proper assessment … of tax" means. That was used in legislation on some Keith committe changes last year. It is deliberately defined in such wide terms by the Revenue and must be taken with "serious". I cannot say what avoidance or evasion schemes will arise until the facts are known rather than surmised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we need to clarify and simplify the law, because we have EEC obligations and because the amendment is technically flawed and could cost the Exchequer £10 million, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. I accept that he tabled it entirely for benevolent purposes, and because he wanted to stop possible loopholes in the law and to prevent evasion or abuse, but the Inland Revenue is satisfied that the hon. Gentleman's fears are groundless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is seven or eight years since the Keith committee reported on the enforcement powers of Customs and Excise and of the Inland Revenue. I pay tribute to the Inland Revenue and to the Treasury for the way in which they have consulted on difficult questions that have arisen. They have taken a long time, but that was necessary to get it right. It shows a marked contrast to the way in which Customs and Excise dealt with the matter. Virtually all the changes relating to Customs and Excise appeared in the Finance Act 1985 and are now causing difficulty to VAT-registered traders, whereas the more measured, slower approach adopted by the Inland Revenue in consulting taxpayers means that a sensible balance now exists between the interests of taxpayers and the important need, the national interest, for the Inland Revenue to collect as much tax as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
If the Inland Revenue is happy with the clause and it does not restrict its powers to collect or to assess tax, and if it has not been imposed by the Treasury, that speaks for itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I assure the Economic Secretary that Opposition amendments are always tabled in a benevolent spirit. We wish to improve the Bill in ways that are in the national interest and if that results in a better Bill, so much the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary has rightly identified a possible technical defect in the amendment, so it is not sensible to press it to a Division, but in this debate and in that on the previous amendment, he gave the Committee two interesting pieces of information. First, he said that the power of the board to require information has been used in only about 10 cases a year. That is a remarkably small number. I hope that that shows that the Inland revenue has sufficient powers outside the clause to glean all the necessary information, but if that is not so, I cannot believe that only about 10 cases of serious abuse arise in any year. We shall keep a careful eye on how the Inland Revenue operates in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in response to the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), the Economic Secretary said that the matter would be kept under review in the next year or two. In the light of that comment, and because the wording of the amendment is technically deficient, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Clause 99 relates to the power to require information in relation to inheritance tax while clause 79 dealt with the power to require information in relation to income tax. Why is a different test to be applied to the requirement to provide information in each case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of clause 99 is similar to that which the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) included in his amendment about income tax. Why is it that the wording was rejected by the Government in relation to income tax, but appears in their clause dealing with inheritance tax? It is odd that two different sets of wording apply to slightly different tests. This test would appear to be slightly more onerous on the Revenue and more beneficial to the taxpayer than that in clause 79. It would be useful to know why the Government proposed two different methods for two taxes in the same Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:This clause makes the Revenue's general power to obtain information for the purposes of capital transfer tax and inheritance tax subject to prior
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
approval by an appeal commissioner. This change will increase the protection of the taxpayer against abuse of the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to administer capital transfer tax and inheritance tax, the Revenue has power to call for accounts from the taxpayers—mainly executors, donees and trustees—specifying the property that has been transferred and its value. However, in some situations, the Revenue may not know who it should ask to provide an account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Revenue may be aware that a financial institution is marketing a tax avoidance scheme but it does not know the names and addresses of the clients who may perhaps have incurred a capital transfer tax and inheritance tax charge. Section 219 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 gives the Revenue power to demand information from the financial institution about its clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power, which is widely drawn, allows the Revenue to approach anyone it believes may be able to give the required information. But in practice the Revenue uses this power very sparingly—about a dozen times a year, mainly against banks and other financial institutions. At present there is no automatic review by, or direct right of appeal to any judicial authority against the use of the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Keith Committee on the Enforcement Powers of the Revenue Departments looked at the section 219 information power, it approved of its wide coverage and noted that its use had attracted no critical comment. Nevertheless it believed that it ought to be balanced by enhanced safeguards for the taxpayer and others against whom it was used. Therefore the committee proposed the introduction of a right of appeal to the commissioners after the information had been requested by the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) asked me a specific question about the difference in the statutory provision for tests on inheritance tax and those for income tax. Clause 99 corresponds with the existing power for income tax and capital gains tax exercised by the Inspector of Taxes. That is a day-to-day power. Clause 79, described by the Revenue as a last resort power, covers reserved powers exercised by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for me to stress that there is no reason in principle why the capital transfer tax and inheritance tax power should be different from the main tax powers. Therefore, it has been decided to make the section 219 inheritance tax demand for information subject to the prior consent to the commissioners. That brings CTT and IHT into line with the main taxes and responds positively by offering an even greater protection to people, which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury must welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Economic Secretary has not answered my question. He said that clause 99 is bringing CTT and inheritance tax into line with the main existing provisions, but the Government are simultaneously moving the goalposts on income tax with the provisions that we have just discussed on clause 79. While they are moving one set of provisions into line with existing practice, they are changing the existing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
position on income tax. The Economic Secretary has not given a sensible reason for doing that or an explanation of the difference between the two provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary said that the use of the powers in the existing format under the existing statute, as practised by the Inland Revenue, has aroused no critical comment. If there has been no problem with the existing system, why do the Government want to change it? That has the air of a Government who were looking for a little padding in a thin year, after a thin Budget, so that they could include in the Finance Bill an unnecessary change that would not alter the practical, on-the-ground experience of the Inland Revenue, but would fill out a few lines of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Is it not the case that, as my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said, the clause is in the Bill because the Keith committee recommended that it should be? It decided that although there had been no criticism, there should be some statutory restrictions on such an arbitary and unfettered power. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) sought a distinction between clauses 79 and 99. One relates to the power of the board and the other to the power of the inspector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman forgets that considerable time has elapsed since the Keith committee recommendations. Even though the Government were intent on implementing the whole of the Keith report—they have not yet done so—it is strange that they should single out these particular provisions now. The hon. Gentleman fails to understand that the tests in clauses 79 and 99 are different. The test in clause 79 is
	<br><blockquote><p>"prejudice to the proper assessment or collection of tax."</p></blockquote>
The test in clause 99 is
	<br><blockquote><p>"being satisfied that in all the circumstances the Board are justified".</p></blockquote>
Those are two different tests. Nothing that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) can say will satisfy me that they are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary has not provided a satisfactory response. The point is not important, as only about 10 or 12 instances a year are involved, but the Opposition will keep a careful eye on whether the restricted powers work in practice. If not, we shall return to this matter in future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I owe the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) a reply. There is no question of this being a "padding" clause. As I explained in my opening remarks, we are obliged, under a 1977 EC directive to support this measure. The previous Labour Government supported it and it was taken through the House by the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon). As Britain has a far better record in implementing directives than any other country in the European Community, it is only right and proper that the Government and the Opposition should be at one in supporting this measure.

The hon. Gentleman has said that he will look carefully at how the provision works out. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith)
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
observed in his intervention, the clause implements a recommendation of the Keith committee that the existing and unrestricted inheritance tax information power should be limited in the interests of the taxpayer or other people against whom it is used.

There should be a minimum of tax avoidance. Because of our system of law, the Inland Revenue is entitled to collect its taxes and the Finance Bill Committee must make that job as easy as possible. In other walks of life, people may try to make it as hard as possible, and as long as people act within the law there can be no argument with them, but we must try to close the loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has it taken more than 12 years for the Government to produce this clause? I welcome it, and think that it is about right. The amendments seek to extend it. If suitable mutual agreements existed between Britain and, for example, the United States, such cooperation must be in the interests of the Inland Revenue and the United States tax authorities. If the Government do not see the sense of that, the Opposition can only conclude that the Government have been forced to introduce this measure by the Common Market—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members are nodding violently, so that may be so. The committee would like to know whether it is.

I also want to speak in the clause stand part debate. The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) was right to say that Conservative Members await reassurances about the clause, but we are horrified when we consider the scope of the Opposition amendments. The Opposition fail to recognise that Britain has the benefit of an Inland Revenue service and a body of inspectors of taxes who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
regarded as among the finest and least corrupt in the world. Every inspector is required to take an oath before he is allowed to lay a finger on any information about taxpayers' affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 100 now requires such an inspector to obtain information not only on what he judges necessary to collect British revenue but to collect that of other EEC member states. The committee may require a reassurance on that in the clause stand part debate. The opposition seek to take the matter further and allow the Inland Revenue of any banana republic—a phrase that I use advisedly—to demand that the Inland Revenue collect information which that republic will be able to use to persecute its own citizens or those of another country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lord Chesterfield's letters were more interesting and entertaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 101 the Government are being nice to local authorities for the first time in many years. The clause redefines "local authority" for the purposes of the Taxes Act to ensure that local authorities, as now constituted under the system of local government, do not pay income, corporation or capital gains taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am puzzled that one definition of a "local authority" is
	<br><blockquote><p>"an authority having power to make or determine a rate."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (4) reiterates that definition of an authority as
	<br><blockquote><p>"having power to make or determine a rate"</p></blockquote>
or to precept on a rate-making power. I suspect that the Government can enlighten me about the definition, but now that there is a uniform business rate, water rates are charged by an authority rather than by a private company, and poll tax has been substituted for the general domestic rate, it is worth asking why the Government have included those provisions in the clause, unless the review of the operation of the poll tax that the Government are undertaking is so radical that they now envisage a return to domestic rates instead of persevering with the poll tax. It would be useful to know whether the inclusion of that definition in the clause lets the cat out of the bag.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Some bodies still have legal powers to make a rate.

A rate is defined as a levy applicable for public local purposes, which is calculated by referring to the value of land or other property. The community charge relates to people rather than to land or property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful for that clarification. Is the Economic Secretary saying that, for the purposes of the tax system, the Crown Estates Paving Commissioners is a local authority?

	<p>	<i>Queston proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:This clause increases the amount that may be lent by the public works loan board commissioners. I should be interested to know why the Government want to incerease that amount. I hasten to add that we welcome the provision, but the Treasury appears to be making it increasingly difficult for local authorities to borrow from the public works loan board. Often they are forced by Government fiat to seek loans on the open market, at a higher rate of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that we shall pursue that matter through other channels. We shall certainly draw it to the attention of the Public Accounts Committee, because it imposes an extra burden on local authorities already facing severe financial problems. Given the difficulties created by the Government for local authorities wishing to borrow from the PWLB, why are the Government seeking the additional powers provided in clause 104?.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The changes in clause 104 have become necessary because local authorities have borrowed large sums from the PWLB at below market rates, while at the same time investing large amounts in the banking sector, for which higher rates are paid. That has caused problems for the management of the money market. The quota changes do not limit local authorities' total borrowing, but they will cut out the slack in the existing quota system by limiting the amount that authorities, especially those with large investments, can borrow on highly favourable terms from the PWLB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause raises the limit on the outstanding principal of loans granted by the public works loan commissioners to £55 billion. It allows further increases by statutory instrument to 70 billion. The public works loan commissioners approve loans to local authorities and other prescribed bodies. The statutory lending limit was last increased in the Finance Act 1986. Clause 104 ensures that the PWLB commissioners can continue making loans to local authorities and other prescribed bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a potentially very useful amendment wearing a heavy disguise. Although we had observed that the new clause contained an omission, I am afraid that it had escaped our attention that our amendment also contains an error. On behalf of the Opposition Front Bench, I should like to offer our profound apologies to whatever poor soul has been trying to dicipher it in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference to schedule 12 of the Finance Act 1973 should be a reference to schedule 12 of the Finance Act 1984. That measure deals with an exemption for corporate bonds from capital gains, and the reference is to the definition of a normal commercial loan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order.

The difficulty seems to have arisen because the Government repealed the reference to paragraph 1(5) during the Taxes Act 1988, and never changed the cross-reference. Therefore, we sought helpfully to draw their attention to this slightly arcane difficulty, but managed to do so in a way that was slightly incorrect. That being so, I can understand how neither the Economic Secretary nor the Financial Secretary might have quite the appropriate briefing, and might wish to take the matter away and consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This new clause makes a minor amendment to section 126 of the Finance Act 1984, so that stamp duty reserve tax is included in tax exemptions already available for securities issued by international organisations of which the United Kingdom is a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it will apply to securities issued by any international organisation designated by the Treasury, the occasion for the introduction of the new clause is the establishment in London of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Because it will be resident in the United Kingdom, in certain restricted circumstances the issue of the EBRD's securities would otherwise attract a charge to stamp duty reserve tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant stamp duty reserve tax charges are the higher rate 1.5 per cent. charges which arise on the issue of chargeable securities to a nominee for either a depositary bank or a clearance service. The articles of agreement require these charges to be removed, which is what the new clause achieves.

We are glad that the EBRD has been secured for London, on account of the excellent negotiations carried out by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The meat of this group of new clauses and amendments is to be found in amendment No. 257, which sets out the detail of the new schedule. Changes are required consequent upon developments introduced by the Broadcasting Bill. The changes seek to ensure that no artificial tax liability arises when the Independent Broadcasting Authority and the Cable Televsion Authority give way to the new bodies—the Independent Television Commission, the Radio Authority and the new transmission company. The Opposition do not object to the principle of Government new clause 55, nor to the new schedule that it implements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have four brief, technical questions to which it would be useful to have responses. First, we are slightly puzzled about why the equivalents of paragraphs 2(2) and 2(3) of the proposed new schedule were not added as provisos to paragraphs 3 and 4. Will no pre-1982 assets or debts be transferred to direct broadcasting by satellite contractors or to the commission? If so, we can understand why the Government are not including the additional provisos, but if such assets or debts are to be transferred, the absence of parallel inclusions seems strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what will be the capital gains base cost of the acquirers for pre-1982 assets? Under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the proposed new schedule, the Independent Broadcasting Authority would have no chargeable gain or allowable loss, but for some pre-1982 assets two possible sale prices could be adjudged—prices based on cost, or prices based on 1982 value. Which will be deemed purchase price for the acquirer of the asset? The tax treatment is likely to be different, depending on which base is used.

Thirdly, paragraph 6 allocates the IBA's old capital losses. We are worried about whether capital losses should, as a matter of principle, be transferred in such circumstances. That might allow the nominated company, the transmission body that takes over transmission responsibilities from the IBA, to purchase capital gains by a shell company in a minor form of tax
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
avoidance. Given that it is intended that the company be a responsible public body, that should not occur, but the danger remains. We are worried that the transfer of capital losses is being allowed at all under the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, we are unsure what paragraph 6(2) adds to the meat of paragraph 6. It seems otiose and we wonder why the Governent want to include it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those points of detail have given us slight anxiety, but we do not wish to demur from the principle that no artificial adverse tax treatment should apply, given that the IBA is, perhaps sadly, going out of business as a result of the Broadcasting Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I welcome the hon. Gentleman's acceptance of the principle that these arrangements should be made. On his point about the treatment of pre-1982 assets for capital gains tax purposes, he surmised correctly that none of the assets involved were held at 31 March 1982, so the issue does not arise. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the IBA's old capital losses would be transferred and whether the nominated company would be able to shelter them. The transfer is consistent with the aim of putting the transmission company in the position it would have been in had it carried out the activities from the start. I am informed that any losses are not likely to be large but, for the sake of completeness, we thought it appropriate to cover them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether I have met all the hon. Gentleman's points, but I may soon be able to cover one or two further outstanding details. In the meantime, I am happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I intervene only, as always, to assist the Government. The Financial Secretary has not said whether the capital gains base cost for pre-1982 assets would be based on cost or at 1982 value. Nor has he said why subparagraph (2) has been added to paragraph (6) of the proposed schedule. That puzzles us slightly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention. I had in fact answered his first point about the treatment of pre-1982 assets. As no assets prior to that date are affected by this transfer, we do not have to decide the cost base for them..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for what he has said. My point, which he answered, about the existence of pre-1982 assets or debts, related to those transferred to DBS contractors or to the ITC. Is he confirming in his subsequent answer that no pre-1982 assets are owned by the IBA or by the Cable Authority, so the question of the pre-1982 valuation does not arise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I did not answer the hon. Gentleman's point about assets going to the transmission company. He wanted to know whether the cost of the pre-1982 assets would be the sale price based on cost or on 1982 value. The transmission company will effectively stand in the shoes of the IBA for capital gains tax purposes. It

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That was a very cogent point, Mr. Cormack.
