	<div class='title'>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) ACT 1987: CO-OPERATION WITH OTHER BODIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'Where a local authority requests a Health Board or housing agency to co-operate to assist them in the discharge of their functions in respect of the planning, assessment and provisions of community care services, the body to whom the request is made shall co-operate in rendering such assistance in the discharge of the functions to which the request relates as is reasonable in the circumstances. For the purposes of this Act a housing agency shall include only district and islands councils, any body funded by Scottish Homes, and new town development corporations.'.—	<i>[Mr. Maxton.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following: New Clause 17—	<i>Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968: Co-operation with Other Bodies</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>'Where a local authority requests a Health Board or housing agency to co-operate to assist them in the discharge of their functions in respect of the planning, assessment and provisions of community care services, the body to whom the request is made shall co-operate in rendering such assistance in the discharge of the functions to which the request relates as is reasonable in the circumstances. For the purposes of this Act a housing agency shall include only district and islands councils, any body funded by Scottish Homes, and new town development corporations.'.</p></blockquote>
New Clause 18—	<i>National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978: Co-operation with Other Bodies</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>'Where a local authority requests a Health Board or housing agency to co-operate to assist them in the discharge of their functions in respect of the planning, assessment and provisions of community care services, the body to whom the request is made shall co-operate in rendering such assistance in the discharge of the functions to which the request relates as is reasonable in the circumstances. For the purposes of this Act a housing agency shall include only district and islands councils, any body funded by Scottish Homes, and new town development corporations.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised, Dame Janet, that the three new clauses have been grouped together, because their wording is almost identical. They would amend three Acts to enable local authorities to co-operate with other bodies, thereby ensuring the proper working of community care systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this may be one of the last occasions on which the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland speaks in this Committee, I hope that he will deal with the principles underlying the new clause, and not merely nit-pick at its wording. He derives great amusement from finding fault with the wording of amendments or new clauses, yet he never manages to address their principles. I accept that he has made some concessions on housing authorities, but he has not gone as far as the Opposition would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
All hon. Members recognise the need for community care, but the Opposition have doubts about the fact that the Bill will transfer the burden of community care provision to local authorities without providing a legislative framework to ensure that other bodies, which must be involved in providing community care, co-operate with local authorities in assessments, planning and delivery of services. The Bill leaves everything to the local authorities, which will be directed by the Secretary of State. No compulsion will be placed on any other organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas of Scotland—though not in many—such an informal approach may work. The Western Isles, for example, have a single-tier authority, which has housing and social work functions. Some members of the council, such as the convener, are also members of the health board. In such a small community co-operation is possible, because departments meet regularly in the same building and discussions can take place when people meet in the street, if nowhere else. But in Glasgow, where the Greater Glasgow health board, Strathclyde regional council and Glasgow district council all operate, the situation is different. I met the Glasgow health board last Friday, and the problem arose during informal conversation with the general manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde regional council, which covers a population of 2-5 million, will be the providing authority. It is the largest single local authority in the United Kingdom, and covers a wide range district authorities of varying size and political complexion, though few support the Government. The district authorities within Strathclyde are the housing authorities. Among those housing authorities is the Glasgow district council, which is the largest landlord in Europe covering a population of nearly 1 million, almost 60 per cent, of whom live in council housing. The Greater Glasgow health board covers a slightly larger area than the Glasgow district council, with a population of almost 1 million. Therefore, we are discussing large authorities: Strathclyde deals with a population of 2-5 million, and the other two bodies within Glasgow deal with 1 million each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The necessary arrangements for co-operation are impossible without a legislative framework and legislative pressure upon authorities to provide it. That is an opinion shared by many who deal with community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an informal conversation, the general manager of the Greater Glasgow health board—who is much closer politically to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland than he is to me, and who I greatly criticise for ruthlessly pushing through privatisation in the Greater Glasgow health board and for some of his other actions—expressed worries to me about the lack of a legislative framework in which the board could co-operate with the social work department of Strathclyde region. He believes that, if the Bill is to work, such a framework is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde regional council controls Lennox Castle hospital, which comes within the Greater Glasgow health board area. The general manager is greatly worried about releasing patients—some of whom have been in hospital for 15 or 20 years, should never have been there and would now not go there, but who are institutionalised—without knowing what the methods will be, with whom he will have to work, or how he will ensure proper assessment and the provision of proper back-up services by the local authorities. He is right to express those anxieties because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
informal co-Operation, which will inevitably exist in the smaller authorities, will not occur in the larger ones. Large bureaucracies do not always co-operate with one another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the health boards there is grave anxiety that the co-operation will not take place unless it is forced by legislation. They should be forced to review their structures to discover how they can obtain the best deal for their patients. Although local authorities will become the providers, many people are now in the care of health boards. Unless health boards have a clearly defined structure for releasing their patients into community care, they will not be happy with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be less than honest if I did not say that the co-operation between Glasgow district council and Strathclyde regional council is not always what it should be. There are personality clashes—oddly enough, not at the political level, as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) may think—between officials, especially at the top. If community care is to work, co-operation between regional social work departments and local and district housing departments must be finely tuned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing authorities will come under pressure from local tenants not to provide housing for some groups of people. Everyone sympathises with the principle of community care, but when it is practised, NIMBY soon comes into force. That means, "Not in my backyard," in case anyone is wondering. So housing authorities must be under a statutory obligation to provide housing and to co-operate; otherwise, they may give in to local pressure and not provide necessary facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses seek to give a legislative framework to such co-operation. They may not be perfectly worded, but a principle is being stated. If the new clauses are not acceptable, we hope that the Government will accept the principle and draft for Report or for the debates in the other place new clauses that will provide the legislative framework that we seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary responds positively, because hon. Members on both sides are worried about the lack of legislative framework for the other bodies which must be part of community care, if it is to work; otherwise there is the risk that people will be released from hospitals and other institutions and end up on the streets because of a failure of co-operation between organisations. We have seen that in England; we do not want it in Scotland. The new clauses seek to prevent it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) talked about Glasgow district council, which gave a reception for the East German Government to celebrate their 40 years in power. I am sure that Herr Honecker would be pleased with these new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend heard the rumour that Glasgow district council is thinking of planning a wake for President Ortega?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard that rumour, but no doubt the council will have to change a few street signs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> At the beginning of my speech I asked the Under-Secretary not to indulge in such remarks and to tackle the basic principles of the new clauses. Does not the Prime Minister hold up Glasgow as a glowing example of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
what co-operation between local authorities and the private sector is all about? Why does not the Minister follow the Prime Minister's lead, as he normally does?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister extols what has been achieved in Glasgow, she no doubt has in mind the hundreds of millions of pounds that she has provided for the city to improve itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Honecker would be proud of the new clauses because they seek legislative powers to direct housing, social work and health authorities to reach agreement with each other. In many respects, the new clauses echo a previous amendment to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart added his name, and which was withdrawn. In that amendment the Opposition argued that agreement should be reached between social work authorities and health boards when care plans were being drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman expected, I should like to nitpick a little about the wording of the new clauses. The test that applies to each of them is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the body to whom the request is made shall co-operate in rendering such assistance in the discharge of the functions to which the request relates as is reasonable in the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
In that context, what does "reasonable" mean? And how does one decide what reasonable assistance is? In any dispute, one of the parties would claim that it was unreasonable for it to provide more assistance. Even writing the new clauses into statute would not realise the hon. Gentleman's objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that astonishing. The Under-Secretary served with me on the Standing Committee that considered the Abolition of Domestic Rates etc. (Scotland) Bill in 1987. In that Bill the term "reasonable" was used several times and on each occasion I asked, as the Under-Secretary has just done, what "reasonable" meant. The then Minister, Michael Ancram, supported by his hon. Friends, said that everyone knew what "reasonable" meant, and that it was easy to work out: it was what was reasonable. The Under-Secretary is now objecting to an argument that the Government have used themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The test of reasonableness is not what I am arguing about. My question is what "reasonable co-operation" means. The hon. Gentleman has not explained how that would be evaluated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would cut out the Secretary of State's powers of direction and substitute a test of reasonable co-operation. The courts would be involved in disputes, instead of the Secretary of State using his powers of direction when agreement was not reached. The Bill provides for local authorities to draw up their care plans and to work in co-operation with housing authorities and health boards. The Secretary of State will have powers of direction of both health boards and social work authorities, which should ensure that the hon. Gentleman's anxieties are met when agreement has not been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned a meeting that he had had with the general manager of the Greater Glasgow health board, to whom I pay tribute for the excellent way in which he set about the tasks faced by that board, especially the challenge at Lennox Castle hospital, which the board has transformed. The hon. Gentleman asked how a general manager would operate, what structure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1273</span>
would be implemented, and how it would work. That is what the care plan which will be drawn up by Strathclyde region, is meant to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion that Strathclyde is a large bureaucracy that will be unable to fulfil its functions to the satisfaction of the health board is a blistering attack on that regional council. I am certain that it will be able to draw up care plans that will take account of places such as Lennox Castle hospital and the future direction of policy there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart also said that relations between Glasgow district and Strathclyde regional councils were not good. The elected members have a responsibility to sort that out. Legislation that would leave the courts to settle disputes between housing and social work authorities would take responsibility away from the elected members, with whom it should remain, and place it in the hands of the courts. For those reasons I cannot commend the new clauses to the Committee, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Max ton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was what I would have expected the Minister to say about the new clauses. He failed to address the basic principles and instead used cheap political jibes. I do not share the regard for the Minister expressed by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Secretary of State could direct social work departments and health boards. He does not have the power to direct housing authorities, which are crucial to community care. If the Minister does not believe that, he should do some research in the areas and with the people with whom I co-operate. At present, there is a lot of good co-operation between district and regional health boards and local authorities in Glasgow. But the structure is such that it is not easy to ensure that that will always be so in an area such as Castle Milk in my constituency. The social work department, the housing authority and elected members and representatives of other community groups work together on a liaison committee. Representatives of the health board attend when they are invited to, but not automatically. I accept that there is a lot of co-operation at health board level, but when it breaks down, legislative control is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must consider much more seriously how the housing authorities will co-operate. Over the past 10 years, there have been massive cuts in local government housing. District authorities are sceptical about how they are to provide the housing and accommodation required. Does the Minister intend that it shall be provided only through housing associations and Scottish Homes? What will the Minister, or the Minister responsible for housing, provide? Even if I accept that the Minister has responsibility for social work, if only on this Committee, he is not responsible for housing in Scotland. He is responsible for health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, three different Ministers are responsible for the three sectors covered by the Bill. The hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) is in charge of health, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) is in charge of housing and the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) is in charge of social work. Who gives the directions to whom? How will they get the housing authorities to co-operate? I have doubts about the directions because there is nothing in the Bill, unlike other legislation, to enable the Minister to give
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
directions to health boards on certain issues. I accept that the Bill enables him to give directions to social work departments, but I am not sure about health boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the housing agency, because in many respects housing is the key issue. What powers does the Minister have? Will he give us examples? Where is he, or the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, who has responsibility for housing, given the power to give directions to a housing authority to co-operate with the social work department for the purpose of providing sheltered accommodation for the elderly, or hostel accommodation for people who are homeless, living on the streets or discharged from hospital? Glasgow district council has led the way—certainly in Scotland, if not in the whole of the United Kingdom—in its housing provision and the imaginative way in which it approaches housing. Can the Secretary of State instruct district councils in Glasgow, Renfrew, Hamilton or Motherwell, or any other district councils in the Strathclyde region, to build more sheltered housing? Can he say, "I am told by the social work department in Strathclyde that it needs x number of places in Glasgow for people needing sheltered accommodation, because it does not want that number of elderly people to go into homes or residential care. It wants those people to stay in the community, and it believes that sheltered accommodation is the right way to do that."? Does the Secretary of State have power to do that? I do not believe so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart is right to say that the Secretary of State does not have that power. But is the hon. Gentleman seriously arguing that the Secretary of State should have the power to tell housing authorities what their priorities should be? Is that the Labour party's policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what new clause 16 says; it says that there should be co-operation. The Minister said, "Don't worry. We do not need this co-operation. We do not need this legislative framework. Why not? Because the Secretary of State can direct the social work department to decide its priorities, and he can direct the health board to decide its priorities." If the Minister follows the logic of his argument—it is not my argument, nor that of the new clauses—it is clear that the Secretary of State equally should have the power to direct housing authorities. That is the Minister's argument. My argument is built into the new clause, and my aim is to ensure that social work departments should have the right to tell housing authorities, "You will co-operate with us in this provision." We do not want the Secretary of State to give that direction. We want the provision to be made in conjunction with social work departments in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Minister has failed to demonstrate how housing authorities fit into the legislative framework of community care that he is establishing, in terms of providing housing for people who need it. Most Scottish housing authorities are so strapped for money that they cannot build any new housing, sheltered or otherwise. This year, Hamilton district council has a minus capital allocation for building. What will the Secretary of State and the regional council do if Strathclyde region tells Hamilton that it should have a certain amount of sheltered housing, and Hamilton replies, "We are very sorry, but we cannot provide it. We simply do not have the money to provide it, and there is nothing we can do about it."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1275</span>
The Minister is failing to provide answers and is thus fuelling the fears that many people have about community care. We all favour ensuring that those who are at risk —whether because of mental illness or mental handicap, or because they have come out of prison or hospital— should be cared for in the community if possible. But that can be done only if the bodies are compelled, on a multi-disciplinary basis, to work together properly. The Minister has not provided answers to the questions asked. Even at this late stage, I hope that he will say something about housing—he said nothing in his response—before I decide what I wish to do with the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to oblige the hon. Gentleman. His argument was perhaps a little confused. He appeared to argue that powers are necessary to force housing and social work authorities and health boards to co-operate with each other. The new clauses would provide for the decision about whether such co-operation is being given to be made by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's remarks were sensible in so far as agencies should work together, decide what is needed and agree between them what resources they are prepared to commit to meet their common objectives for community care. But the hon. Gentleman argued that they might not co-operate—for example, that Glasgow district council might not get on with Strathclyde—so it is necessary to force them to co-operate by statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I told the hon. Gentleman, the Secretary of State has powers of direction for health boards; those powers are real and can be used. I believe that he has used them only once, in respect of Fife, over a laboratory dispute relating to health. Moreover, the Bill contains powers for the social work authorities—the regional councils. But they are reserve powers for the eventuality of a failure to co-operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said, in effect, "That is all very well, but what about housing authorities? The Secretary of State does not have powers of direction in respect of housing authorities." That is correct. I asked the hon. Gentleman whether it is Labour party policy that the Secretary of State should take those powers, and he indicated that it was not. We can agree on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leaves the question of whether it would be sensible for the Bill to require housing authorities to respond to requests from social work authorities or health boards to provide housing when such requests are reasonable. The test of whether those requests were reasonable would thus lie with the courts. But that is not a sensible way to proceed. It is far more sensible for the social work authority to draw up care plans and to involve the housing authority and other agencies, including the health boards —indeed, the Bill provides for this—in discussion and in their drafting. Community care would be delivered through reasonable discussion and co-operation. Nothing that we could write into the Bill would alter the real need for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's wording—he accused me of nitpicking—would not achieve his objectives and I cannot think of any that would. One cannot legislate for people to co-operate and work together. I believe that the care plans and their structure will provide the right framework, and I would view with horror any proposal to take powers of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>
direction over housing authorities. Apart from anything else, that would leave out a whole section of the housing movement—the housing associations and other bodies which has a vital part to play in community care and ought to be involved in drawing up care plans. I hope that that will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that last remark astonishing, because it proves that the Minister has not even read the new clauses. The last sentence of new clause 16 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Act a housing agency shall include only district and islands councils, any body funded by Scottish Homes, and new town development corporations."</p></blockquote>
The bodies funded by Scottish Homes include all housing associations in Scotland, both the large charitable associations and the small community-based associations. If the Minister had read the new clause, he might have spotted that before making his last remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister changed his tune, because in his opening remarks he said that he expected there to be co-operation anyway, but his major line of attack was upon the direction powers of the Secretary of State. I accept that there may be co-operation. I hope that there will be co-operation, and I believe that there will be in 90 per cent, of cases. It is easy for social work departments to draw up broad plans with the health boards and housing authorities, but we are concerned with the individual patient and how we can ensure that each patient who needs community care will receive it in a multi-disciplinary way from a variety of different organisations. That is what the new clauses seek to ensure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is convinced that this can be achieved through co-operation, we shall have to wait and see. I only hope that by the time the full effects of the clause are felt, the Minister will no longer be a Minister. He will probably not even be in this place, and we will be able to change the law if necessary when the time comes.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause offers the Government an opportunity to demonstrate some commitment to training for care in the community. It seeks to require each local authority to "establish procedures for the training of social workers and others … for duties laid upon them pursuant to the passing of this Act."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision is as wide as it is necessary, because of the variety of responsibilities which will come under the community care provisions of the Bill. The new clause also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall make grants to local authorities in respect of expenditure incurred"</p></blockquote>
on that training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In both cases, the new clause says "shall", not "may be". That essential reassurance should be built into the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
Bill. It would not unduly constrain the Secretary of State, because of course he will determine the requirements on local authorities, but it would ensure that the Secretary of State will determine that requirement and make the resources available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the beginning, there has been a suspicion that the community care elements of the Bill, worthy though they are, partially reflect the Government's wish to pass responsibility for the care of the elderly, the disabled and the mentally ill to local authorities, and the unworthy thought has passed through the minds of many of us that the Government would find it advantageous to be able to cut the contribution which the Government make to that care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause offers the Minister an opportunity either to show us that that is not the Government's intention or to reinforce that suspicion. I hope that the Minister will accept the clause and help to dismiss that fear from the minds of Opposition Members and all of those in voluntary and statutory organisations who are concerned with the care of the elderly and the disabled, and indeed, of everybody in the population. As all of us will grow elderly we therefore have a long-term interest in the success of the care-in-the-community provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the concerns and fears to which he alludes are already very much present in most local authorities? They have seen people on their streets suffering as a result of the lack of resources in the large institutions which have turned them out, perhaps with the best intentions in the world. The local authorities see themselves as having to take on the role of caring for those people. They cannot see an alternative. The process which my hon. Friend describes is in place already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. There is much fear about the nature of implementation, and he makes a telling point when one considers the challenge which many social workers will face. I shall jump forward in my speech and refer to the nature of training of the people who will face the challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Association of Social Workers, in a constructive document on the implementation of the Bill, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are thousands of untrained and unqualified staff, especially in such sensitive areas as residential and day care work where they are in intimate daily contact with service users. It is no longer enough to say that providing social care is common sense and demands no training, as demonstrated in a number of recent inquiries into residential care scandals".</p></blockquote>
That has applied to the care of the elderly and disabled and to child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association has rightly called for a bolder initiative from the Government
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the workforce implications of the community care proposals are to be effective. None of the hoped for changes will succeed unless the workforce is appropriately trained and supported. This has already been recognised in the education service, where a major in-service programme is in process, the so-called 'Baker days'."</p></blockquote>
Although that need was recognised for education, the way in which the programme has worked there hardly inspires confidence because of the enormous pressure that was placed on teachers, who had to continue working while assimilating masses of paperwork and retraining. That will be the problem facing social workers, without a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
recognition of the need for proper training and without a commitment so far from the Government to meet that need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association's document then states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An … ambitious programme is needed for the personal social services, with all the resources and service implications that implies, to embrace the implementation of the new Children Act 1989 as well as the community care proposals. This training must begin before implementation of the Act and will need to continue for some years."</p></blockquote>
We are dangerously close to the implementation of the Act, with that pressure already on social services departments. There is grave cause for concern, which is why the new clause is essential.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new training programmes are recognised for new staff but the only money specifically identified by the Government relates to Training Support Programmes for management and the need for post-qualifying training. In the Scottish proposals … there is a commitment to providing post-qualifying training for key staff who will influence services in the statutory and non-statutory sectors."</p></blockquote>
The Minister will have to explain why that commitment is not paralleled in respect of England and Wales. The document then states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are important structural and managerial changes implied in the White Paper"—</p></blockquote>
and the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but of perhaps greater significance is the emphasis on good practice in assessment, care planning, inter-agency negotiation, consumer lead services and partnership with professionals."</p></blockquote>
Those are all aspects in which training will be essential in the near future. The Government should give a commitment by accepting the new clause to provide the resources as well as to enable training to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention the specific concern about how the proposals will be implemented in the rural areas of Wales. There is grave concern among the professionals that choice will always be limited in rural areas because of the problems of inaccessibility and expense. That will inevitably mean that the range of services will be reduced, given the sparser population of the rural areas. It has been suggested that customers in such areas should receive a rural premium so that they are less disadvantaged. They still have to have something to buy, however, and the Ministers who have responded to debates so far have not demonstrated how that will be provided. The point was made last week and it was completely ignored. It becomes all the more important that training and assessment in rural areas is carried out efficiently and quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some inconsistency, because the Government have recognised the need for substantial levels of training in the Health Service. They have decided to pay the NHS to undertake training. They recognise the need to pay for it and their obligation to do so because the private sector will not pay. There is no parallel provision in the Bill or in any current papers for training in care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to tell the Committee—not with the usual string of platitudes about how nice it is to care for people in the community but with some facts, details and promises and, preferably, acceptance of the new clause —whether the Government are really serious about care in the community. It is not enough to say that they care about it; they must show their care. They have signally failed to show it to the professionals and the organisations involved in care in the community or to carers and elderly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1279</span>
and disabled people. Do the Government not think that training matters, or do they think that they can dump the problem on overstretched local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to Working Paper 10, "Working for Patients", which refers to the Health Service aspect of training. Paragraph 1.1 states that there is
	<br><blockquote><p>"need to ensure that the quantity and quality of training is maintained during and after the implementation of the White Paper proposals. The proposals in this paper, substantial as they are, are necessary exceptions to the general principle that individual employers should be responsible for training." Paragraph 4.6(b) states:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the foreseeable future, however, the overall responsibility for ensuring the continued basic supply of many professional staff will rest with the NHS and arrangements will need to ensure that NHS hospitals are not at a competitive disadvantage to the private sector because of the latter's low training costs".</p></blockquote>
In other words, despite their commercial beliefs in regard to the performance of the private sector, the Government have recognised in the Bill the need to provide and fund training for the Health Service and made provisions for it. Why has that not been done for community care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worrying that these working papers are not available via the Vote Office. Although the first eight documents were made available via the Vote Office, Working Paper 10 was not. I had to borrow the personal copy of a member of the Library staff and photostat it. That applies to everything after Working Paper 8. I ask the Minister to undertake that all the documents issued by the Department of Health, the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office will be provided via the Vote Office, so that hon. Members may obtain them and refer to them regularly and quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also request that the supplementary circulars on both the health and community care provisions in the Bill are sequentially numbered and indexed. The Government are in danger of flooding local authorities and Members of the House with papers in such a way that it will be difficult to keep track of them. I suspect that sometimes Ministers find it difficult to keep track of the documents to which they are referring. Indeed, I see one or two smiles on the Government Benches. If that is the position, I sympathise with them. If nice plastic covers and symbols can be produced for the documents, surely it is possible for the documents to be properly numbered so that we can keep track of them and maintain a serious analysis of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue, however, is the suggestion that the Government are not taking seriously enough training needs for care in the community; they should parallel their proposals and requirements for community care and social work with those for health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working Paper 10 is important, but it is also lengthy, boring and unimaginative on the training of NHS staff. A major defect is that nowhere is there a serious analysis of the need for, or promise of, in-depth training and the resources that are required to ensure that care in the community will work properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the Government are in danger of underestimating the massive changes in approach that are necessary to implement care in the community. The elderly, disabled and mentally ill will pay the price if Ministers get it wrong. Like my hon. Friends, I strongly support care in the community as the means of giving elderly and disabled people a real life instead of a life in an institution. But that cannot be done quickly or on the cheap. Social workers, the voluntary sector and many
	<span class='label label-info column'>1280</span>
others involved in assessment and care will need to make major changes in their approach to meet the challenge of care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work has said that "appropriate training" is needed
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the large numbers of staff directly involved in tending and social care. Many of these have previously been largely untrained and there is currently no structure of qualifications to demonstrate competence and assist career progression."</p></blockquote>
The CCETSW has also said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"many practitioners will require top-up specialist skills as well if they are to successfully collaborate with other providers of care, negotiate and manage care packages and inspect service systems."</p></blockquote>
It points out that the complexity, and thus the level of professional training required, of assessment and care management roles outlined in the White Paper should not be underestimated. I use the term "care management" rather than "case management". The first term, which is that used in the Griffiths report, is more acceptable and perhaps better reflects the roles that should be undertaken than the term which the Government have favoured in their publications. Will the Minister consider adopting the term "care management" in future publications?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the CCETSW, a high level of skill is needed in these matters. When assessing need, judgments about the combined effects of social, physical and psychological factors, and an individual's expressed wishes, will have to be applied to work with disadvantaged groups. Some consumers, such as elderly and disabled people, have been Cinderellas when it comes to the regular and sophisticated monitoring of their changing circumstances. Trained assessment has been underdeveloped and needs substantial input. That is essential if care in the community is to work. I appeal to the Minister to give us a guarantee and promise, and thus necessary reassurance, by accepting the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CCETSW feels that the demographic change, both among welfare workers and informal carers, gives rise to problems. It indicates increased scarcity of community support and the need to attract potential welfare workers into the caring professions. Those major problems already exist, prior to the implementation of the community care provisions and, indeed, the provisions in the Children Act 1989. Courses are currently unable to make good a shortfall of about 700 trained social workers per annum to achieve an output of 5,000 per year. That is despite an overall increase in the numbers of newly qualified staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every public inquiry that has examined failures in the social work system has highlighted the increasing strain and problems which already exist, without the pressures of major changes that the Bill will introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implementation of care in the community must not be regarded as a cheap option and the Government need to provide a real framework and adequate money for the training to implement it. The Minister has expressed her wish for that to happen. She needs, however, to win the battles with the Treasury and to give us a promise—by accepting the new clause—if she is to carry any conviction otherwise, what she says will be an expression of personal wish rather than reassurance to all those, as I mentioned earlier, who require and have a right to demand reassurance at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social workers involved in assessment will need up-to-date technology because quality of care will depend on quality of information and speed of decision-making.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1281</span>
That aspect is not covered in the new clause, but the need for training in that respect is implied. Will the Minister recognise that need and say what the Government will do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inter-agency work will become even more important than ever before. I have been involved in such work in Cardiff and know only too well that such co-operation depends on enormous good will and much time, effort and commitment by everyone. It goes against the grain of ordinary inclinations, as people liking to have a defined pattern of work and to stay within known boundaries. But inter-agency work demands much co-operation and flexibility. Early in the 1970s, I took part in the project on working together for children and their families, which was sponsored by the Welsh Office and the then DHSS. I was involved also in some of the spin-off projects which went on for several years thereafter and took a leading role in training aspects. I chaired the training working party within the authority. However, despite a great deal of commitment and enthusiasm, many of the lessons learnt from the project are still not everyday practice anywhere in the country. That is because it runs against people's usual inclinations—they like to simplify their work patterns— and because there is no ingrained commitment within authorities, Government services, and so on, to bring that about. If that is to be achieved, we need the commitment that is enshrined in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the Bill neglects training for care in the community. The Government have said that they will pay for training in the Health Service, but that is basically because Ministers know that the private sector will not do that job. However, there is no similar provision for community care, even though the need is as great and the dangers possibly even greater. People might become lost in the community, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) said a few minutes ago, unless we provide the right structures and the proper training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the beginning of the Bill's passage through Parliament, fear has arisen that the Government want to provide care in the community on the cheap and that Ministers will shuffle responsibility on to the local authorities. That fear has not been removed by Ministers' responses during our sittings. A series of public inquiries has highlighted the pressures on councils over a range of social work. I appeal to the Government to recognise the need for a major input of training and new technology to give care in the community a real chance of working. We must be sure that elderly, disabled and mentally ill people will be cared for in the community, not neglected, when the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many thousands of untrained staff and voluntary workers, for example, whose functions my hon. Friend described, feel that there is a real crisis. Many aspects of the Bill generate anxiety among the public, but perhaps none more than the question of what will happen to the long-term sick, elderly and mentally ill when they are dispersed among the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a public meeting in Tonyrefail, in my constituency, members of the audience almost bared their souls in expressing their concern. The meeting was attended by senior nursing staff, voluntary carers and the parents of patients who found themselves part of the provision of community care. People who need care are put into the community where there is a great lack of professionally-trained care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1282</span>
Much valuable work is done by voluntary organisations, there are schemes designed to make it more effective and professional in tackling the tasks in hand. But that is not enough. The amendment focuses on the need for more professionally-trained help in the community. Until that is available, there will be a serious crisis in public confidence, people will not trust in the ability of the NHS to deliver the goods after patients are turned out into the community. It is a laudable aim to want break down the barriers between the old institutions, especially those for chronically mentally ill patients, and the community, but the public are suspicious of it. A guarantee is needed that the Bill is not another example of legislation that seemed like a good idea at the time but which will be put into effect without proper back up. The public are worried that the Government have not thought through how the legislation will be applied within communities. People are thrown out of institutions in the belief that they will be taken care of and receive professional aid, comfort and care, only to find that they spend their days languishing on seats in parks. They seek the company of the people whom they knew in the institutions who are in a similar position. There must be a guarantee that such people will receive proper care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would give those who monitor the situation a sense of perspective and a hope that such a deplorable state of affairs will not continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be inappropriate to conclude our proceedings without a detailed debate on training implications. I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) on the comprehensive way in which they have dealt with such serious issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional training for social workers has not been adjusted to take account of legislative changes in the past 20 years and the consequent demands on social workers. Twenty years ago, I took a training course which was based on three pieces of legislation: the Children Act 1948, the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Mental Health Act 1959. Those measures formed the framework of law that social workers had to understand to do their job. Since then, there have been at least 10 important Acts, including the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, the Children Act 1975, the Child Care Act 1980, the Mental Health Act 1983, the Registered Homes Act 1984, the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986, the Children Act 1989 and the Bill. In spite of those measures social workers still receive only two years' training, as they did 20 years ago when the law was less complex and the problems that they had to face were very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I have been a Member of Parliament, the stresses on social workers—for example, in their work on child abuse—have been recognised. Many cases of child sexual abuse are reported now, but although the problem has existed for hundreds of years it was virtually unheard of 20 years ago because it was not reported. Professional training for social work has not reflected the huge changes that have taken place and the pressures upon social workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, in a sense, the odd man or woman out in Europe. Apart from Ireland, we are the only country in which professional social workers train for two years. In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1283</span>
every other country, there is at least three years' training. A couple of weeks ago, I met the former president of the Norwegian professional social workers association. Her country is moving towards a four-year period for the training and education of social workers because the complexity of the work justifies it. In this country, we are stuck with two years, despite the recommendations of the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work. I believe that the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) recognises the difficulties involved and shares my view that there should be a three-year training period. Behind the scenes he has put pressure on the Government to change the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training does not merely enable people to do a job, it gives them the opportunity to consider options to the current ways of solving problems. I am worried that we are pushing an institutional model of providing for handicapped and disabled people. That is inappropriate for vast numbers of people who will be directly affected by the Bill. Time for training gives people the opportunity to innovate and to think about options to the traditional practice. We should encourage people to take time to develop different models of care and to consider methods other than sticking people who are dependent and need help in institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no provision in the legislation for social workers to make innovations. Work with the elderly in particular has changed in the past 20 years, especially in the last decade. Far more people live to a ripe old age, and in some instances that means that they become more dependent. At one time, people with certain handicaps and disabilities would not have survived into old age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attended a funeral of a relative the week before last who was three months off 100 years of age. She was articulate and able right to the end, and it was marvellous to have known her. It was a sad experience to attend her funeral because her relatives and friends hoped that she would reach 100. She lived independently until a few months before she died. It is remarkable that people are able to do so: people should be encouraged to live to a happy, ripe old age. Demands on social workers are greater because people have been helped to live longer and the population is older. Social workers have to cope with more dependent and confused people and the training that they are given does not equip them with the skills that they need to cope with those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) talked about his experience of communities. There is much common ground between the communities in south Wales and those in Yorkshire and Lancashire. That is not merely because of our mutual appreciation of rugby—though of course, our code is far superior to his, as he will know, having spent some time in west Yorkshire —but because the community previously accepted responsibility for the care of elderly and handicapped people. Now the demands on the community are different, because people are moving away to seek work. It is the get-on-your-bike syndrome of the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit). People have always moved away to find work, but what has happened to the traditional care that was available in the community, through the family networks, for the grannies who are left behind when people move to the south or elsewhere? The family
	<span class='label label-info column'>1284</span>
networks do not exist to the same extent as in the past, and in their place social workers have to provide facilities and resources that are insufficient to meet the demand. The Government's policy of mass unemployment has broken many of the family networks in communities and it has attacked the resourcing of social services arrangements that previously allowed people to be cared for in their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will give a huge boost to private welfare, and that worries me very much. Its aim, as the White Paper admits and as its provisions make clear, is to stimulate the private sector. The free market's track record on training for welfare work is worrying. The amount of training done in private homes is non-existent. They do absolutely nothing except drain the public sector for trained employees. In many cases, they do not even recognise the need for training. They take the view that someone who works as a social care assistant and who baths and dresses people does not need any skill or training. I know, however, that staff who have come to the job with nothing more than a caring approach to people can do a better job with the help of professional training. They can be shown how to make a home more like a real home for people who are in institutional care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress the need for professional training, and I do not have in mind only professional field social workers or the academic high fliers. Perhaps too much emphasis is put on such people because much of social work is about common sense. Many of those who make a valuable contribution have had little formal academic education and training. Yet such people play an important role, for example, in the home-help services, which is the front-line service in domiciliary social work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complexity of the work now carried out by social workers is much changed from what it was 20 years ago, but social work training does not recognise the changing needs, complexity, demands and the legal changes that affect the way in which they do their job. The aim of the new clause is reasonable. Ultimately, it will be a matter for local authorities because the private sector, which does not recognise the need for training, will not undertake the task. Local authorities should set a good example. They will be responsible for training, and the Committee should recognise that by agreeing to the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As has been said by Opposition Members, especially by the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), it is easy for practice simply to reinforce existing traditions. We want people to consider their work in a different way, and to that end we have set up a working party. Representatives of the local authority associations are acting in conjunction with the Association of Directors of Social Services and employers in the voluntary and private sector, as well as in the NHS, and the intention is to introduce guidance to ensure that local authorities carry out the necessary training, to investigate whether further training is needed, to prepare and disseminate appropriate training packages and guidance, and to monitor and supervise the initial stages of the implementation of the strategy. In this connection, I shall consider further all that has been said in our debate this morning.

I remind the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that there are already powers in section 63 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, which was amended by section 20 of the Health and Medicines Act 1988 to enable grants to be made to local authorities for training programmes. The training support programme is now initiating important work, and in particular, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the work that is being done for the elderly in the programme's first year, from which about 70,000 people have benefited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Opposition Members referred to changing demands and expectations. Many local authorities are moving their home help services into a home care service, which will require training and a change of attitude. Important work is being carried out in that respect. This year, £7 million-worth of provision has been made for the care of the elderly, increasing to £10 million. Training support programme money is also available for management, because senior and middle management will need to be trained in the different expectations that the community care proposals will introduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be a little premature because my hon. Friend the Minister may be coming to the subject, but does she agree that one of the most valuable injections of resources for social work training will be for people who are already qualified who need specialist qualification, as a form of post-qualification, probably five or 10 years into the job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend leads on to an important subject, because training is carried out at a number of levels. There is, of course, the basic qualifying training. Under the new proposals, the one-year postgraduate social worker training course is to be phased out, and we are ensuring that all courses last for a minimum of two years. My hon. Friend draws attention to the value of the basic qualifying training and of the post-qualifying training, much of which is done in-service. I am sure that we all agree that that is important in community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from qualifying and post-qualifying training, there is vocational training, which we hope to enhance and develop through the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. The Care Sector Consortium, which represents staff and employers, is in touch with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications to see how to approach that training, which we hope will be in place by 1991, for the start of the community care proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1286</span>
In answer to the hon. Member for Wakefield, I draw attention to the important work that is being done by the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, which has the prime responsibility. It has been given a grant of about £15 million, which has been increased by about £3 million this year, because of its work in phasing out the one-year postgraduate courses. I declare an interest because I benefited from a mere one-year post-graduate masters degree course. I am a dinosaur in such matters and I am sure that I should be a better person if I had benefited, as future social workers will, from a two-year post-graduate course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally importantly, CCETSW is working to improve practice placements and collaboration between employers and educational institutions to improve the course curriculum, about which there has been anxiety, and to introduce the new diploma of social work to replace both the Certificate of Qualification for Social Work and the Certificate in Social Studies. Many people who are worried about social work education will welcome those developments. It is important that they be translated into effective action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About £100 million a year is spent on social work training. The prime responsibility is with the employer— the local authority—who receives funds for basic training through the rate support grant. But the training support programme, which provides the power that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth seeks in his amendment, makes an important contribution not only to management and to training people in the care of the elderly, but to providing training for the implementation of the Children Act 1989. An additional £7 million was provided for that purpose, bringing the total provision to about £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wakefield drew attention to the importance of the private sector as well as the local authority and the voluntary sector. Last week I referred to the caring in homes initiative, which resulted from the Wagner report. We recognise the need for training in whatever sector the care is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be levers to allow local authorities to secure higher standards. They may stipulate both the placing of contracts and through the inspection units, that a sufficient proportion of staff be trained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 8.37 to 8.42 of the White Paper "Caring for People" spells out the importance of the work of CCETSW and of the growing contribution of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. A development project undertaken by the social services inspectorate is drawing attention to the areas in which development is needed, to the responsibilities of local authorities, and to the areas in which the Department of Health can assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context, and as there is already a power in the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, I hope that the hon. Genteman is reassured that we recognise the vital role of training, and that his amendment is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disappointed by that response, which gave us fine sentiments but no substance or reassurance. It reinforced all the fears that my hon. Friends and I outlined. I am tempted to suggest that the Minister return for the second and perhaps the third year of social work training. She might come back with a better appreciation of the serious points that we are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the important work of CCETSW, but as a warning to the Minister. Her references to increased
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1287</span>
money amount to an attempt to double-count. The increase in money for social work is to solve problems that have already been identified as serious. It does not meet the needs that will increase as a result of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the circular sent out by the chief inspector of the social services inspectorate, but she did not understand what I said about it, which was that it causes much anxiety. The circular refers to the training support programme for training in social services management. It refers to other subjects at greater length and includes what is expected of local authorities. But it does not accept the Government's responsibilities. The Minister should have understood that, she has failed to respond to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is quick to burden local authorities, as was the chief inspector's circular. She glibly said that training would be covered in the revenue support grant. Will she guarantee an increase in funds from the RSG for training, or will that simply be lost within the general balance? If the Minister seriously believes in the importance of training I only assume that she has lost the battle with the Treasury to obtain the necessary grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talks of the existing legislative power to support training programmes, so why does she run away from the obligation to organise and finance training? Without that obligation there will be no guarantee that training will be provided. The Minister is quick to burden local authorities but not quick enough to accept her responsibility, as the Minister who will implement the Bill for training provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed because the Minister has reinforced her reputation for vague good intentions without showing an appreciation of the challenge that all the professions involved in the Bill's implementation will face, and without appreciating the potential burden that will be placed on local authorities by the Government's proposed method of implementing care in the community. The Minister has not shown the ability to deliver the resources to put a good idea into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that elderly, disabled and mentally ill people will pay the price if Ministers are wrong. The Minister has not reassured us with her lightweight response to a serious debate. Therefore, I call on my hon. Friends to vote for the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 20</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>JOINT FINANCING</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'()—(1) The following sections shall be substituted for section 28A of the National Health Service Act 1977—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) The Secretary of State shall determine the mechanism and specify criteria for making payments towards local authority expenditure on community care services, superseding any arrangements made under sections 22A(1) and (2) of the principal Act.
	<ol>
	<li>(2) The criteria referred to in subsection (1) above shall include the promotion of innovative forms of provision.</li>
	<li>(3) The Secretary of State shall identify receipts from sales of properties held on behalf of the National Health Service and services for use by local authorities in the provision of community care services.</li>
	<li>(4) The Secretary of State may make payments to an authority of the following nature—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>to a local social services authority towards expenditure incurred or to be incurred by them in connection with any function which, by virtue of section 2(1) or (2) of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, is to be performed through their social services committee, other than functions under section 3 of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1958; .</li>
	<li>to a district council, towards expenditure incurred or to be incurred by them in connection with their functions under section 8 of the Residential Homes Act 1980 or Part II of Schedule 9 to the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983 (meals and recreation for old people);</li>
	<li>to an authority who are a local education authority for the purposes of the Education Acts 1944 to 1981, towards expenditure incurred or to be incurred by them in connection with their functions under those Acts, insofar as they perform those functions for the benefit of disabled persons;</li>
	<li>to an authority who are a local authority for the purposes of the Housing Act 1957, towards expenditure incurred or to be incurred by them in connection with their functions under Part V of that Act (provision of housing accommodation); and</li>
	<li>to the following bodies, in respect of expenditure incurred or to be incurred by them in connection with the provision of housing accommodation,—</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>a housing association, as defined in section 189(1) of the Housing Act 1957, which is registered by the Housing Corporation under section 13 of the Housing Act 1974;</li>

	<li>an urban development corporation established under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980;</li>
	<li>the Housing Corporation; and</li>
	<li>the Development Board for Rural Wales.</li>
</ol>
	<li>A payment under this section may be made in respect of expenditure of a capital or of a revenue nature or in respect of both kinds of expenditure.</li>
	<li>No payment shall be made under this section in respect of any expenditure unless the expenditure has been agreed by the local authority after consultation with other appropriate agencies.</li>
	<li>'Other appropriate agencies' under subsection (6) above shall include the District Health Authority and voluntary organisations under consultation agreements to be determined by te Secretary of State.</li>
	<li>Consultation arrangements shall be determined principally by the local authority in accordance with a common procedure specified by the Secretary of State.</li>
	<li>Where expenditure which has been agreed under conditions prescribed in subsection (4) above is for payment in connection with services to be provided by a voluntary organisation;</li>
	<ol>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped to present new clause 20 with my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, (Mr. Cousins), but I am sure that there is a good reason for his absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A strategy for joint financing is essential in a policy for community care. The new clause seeks to ensure that all the parties involved in preparing community care plans are aware of their joint financing responsibilities, and of the demands upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would go further. I draw attention to subsection (3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall identify receipts from sales of properties held on behalf of the National Health Service and services for use by local authorities in the provision of community care services."</p></blockquote>
That is important, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) argued earlier, community care cannot be provided on the cheap. In practice, community care will mean independence for many people, but they cannot be fully independent unless they have proper support from local authorities, social services departments, and health authorities, which provide nursing care. That support will lead to independence within community care, which we all support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Opposition cannot support a policy for community care that does not provide resources at every level. I invite the Committee to accept the conclusions of the Accounts Commission, and what Griffiths proposed, and to examine the resources that are already available and decide how they might be used for joint planning and joint financing. There is much evidence that health boards and health authorities possess valuable land and property that they are tempted to sell. Yet when land has been sold from one sphere of health provision such as psychiatric care, the revenue has been directed into other aspects of health provision. We feel, as do the Accounts Commission and Sir Roy Griffiths, that it is important to identify the assets and to ensure that in such cases the funds are used for the benefit of the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped, the disadvantaged and the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that demands on the Government will grow, and I accept, with my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, that community care cannot be obtained on the cheap. Nevertheless, we should ensure
	<span class='label label-info column'>1290</span>
that the benefit from the sale of properties and land meet the needs of the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and their carers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument, but it is at odds with the Opposition's obstinate determination to retain every valuable inner-city site currently devoted to health, regardless of where the population now live and the relative value of the sites. How does he square his argument with that determination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As community care provision is the subject of our debate, I rely heavily on the views of local communities. Many of the facilities to which the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) referred are required for day nursing, family planning clinics, and so on. But I am not prepared to argue for the imposition of community care plans against the wishes of local people, even in response to the charming question by the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would ensure genuine community care provision, based on genuine joint financing and on making available as many resources as possible for the development of community care. Many health authority properties are being sold, and the resulting revenue could properly be used to provide community care for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause refers to almost every element of community care, including health, housing, education, leisure and recreation. The lives of the most vulnerable in our community are enriched not only by health care, important though that is. Quality of life depends on other things as well. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) argued convincingly this morning, joint financing, as outlined in the new clause, should be a by-product of joint planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I shall deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) about land and buildings, and then speak briefly about new clause 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assets from surplus land and buildings are managed not by district authorities but by regional health authorities on behalf of the Secretary of State. When surplus land or a building is identified for disposal and sold, the region, rather than the district, makes the decision. I cannot answer for Scotland, although doubtless my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will enlighten the Committee if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two pressures affect the disposal of surplus properties. The proceeds can be kept within the Health Service and used to augment the capital expenditure programme. That programme is running at about £1,000 million of taxpayers' money, with on average over the past three years, a further £250 million coming from receipts from the sale of surplus land and buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, there is a prospect of that addition falling because of comparatively high interest rates and the drop in development values. The capital expenditure programme in some parts of the country is certainly under pressure, because extra receipts are not coming in as fast as we would like. That will correct itself as the interest rate cycle moves through its inevitable phases, and there will undoubtedly be a return to the higher level of gross capital expenditure before too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1291</span>
The second factor is capital charges. From 1 April this year, in shadow form, and from 1 April next year there will be obvious pressures upon the DHAs to release surplus land and buildings that they do not need, to release themselves from the burden of the capital charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is up to each region to agree with the districts within it what proportion of the receipts from the sale of surplus land or buildings can be kept and spoken for locally. Normally, regions might reach an agreement that it is 50 per cent, or 75 per cent.—exceptionally, sometimes 100 per cent. It gives the region the chance to redirect capital receipts coming from one town or district to elsewhere in the region for priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister please stop talking about releasing land and assets? What he is really talking about is pressure through capital charges for the biggest ever asset-strip and sale of public land and property. It does not add to the transparency and honesty of the debate when he talks about releasing it, as though, somehow, the land will neutrally slip out. He means flogging off land that has been accumulated, some of it by charitable contributions, most of it by taxpayers' money. It will be flogged off as the Government asset-strip the NHS prior to privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most Committee members would recognise the common sense in selling surplus land and buildings, particularly because that money is recycled directly back into patient care. We can afford a larger gross capital expenditure programme by about 20 per cent., as I have indicated, simply because surplus land can be released and sold for better use by the community, with the money going back into patient care. I see absolutely no reason why we should deny ourselves the opportunity of selling redundant hospital buildings and land, and using that money more productively for the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West addressed his remarks principally at mental illness and handicap. A number of hospitals for the mentally ill and handicapped —several dozen perhaps—will become empty over the next five years and new facilities will replace the facilities built up by our Victorian forbears—long-stay asylums, short-term acute stay facilities in district general hospitals, facilities in community hospital hostels, and so on. The clear guidance that the Department of Health gives the NHS is that, when the site of a hospital for the mentally ill or handicapped is sold, the capital proceeds should stay within the patient group—the client group, as it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, West knows that, in many cases, expenditure has to be incurred before the closure of a hospital, so, when the rule is applied, account must be taken of what has been spent beforehand. That is one reason why my right hon. and learned Friend, the Secretary of State for Health announced a short while ago a great innovation—the capital loans fund. For the first time, the Department of Health can advance up to £50 million over the next three years directly to DHAs to build facilities now, in anticipation of their releasing land from hospitals for the mentally ill and handicapped. That is a major step forward and it removes a significant road block. There was approval and enthusiasm for the project from many quarters, and we hope shortly to make announcements about projects that will be covered in the coming year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is onto an extremely important point, and I am amazed that the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) does not recognise that far from asset-stripping, redundant buildings and surplus land will be got rid of as quickly as possible—which some of us have pressed for for a long time—to help fund new improvements in the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the example of the Memorial hospital in Haverfordwest, which was replaced 10 years ago by an brand new district hospital, the Withybush general hospital. However, the land on which the old hospital stood and its buildings have still not been sold, although there are negotiations currently to release the capital value of the land for future developments for the NHS. Surely the hon. Member for Peckham should be glad that that is happening in the NHS, and perhaps she should get her own local authority to do the same. I travel through the hon. Lady's constituency every morning to come to the House of Commons, and there are plenty of sites owned by the London borough of Southwark which have been standing empty, derelict and full of rubbish for years which that council should release for future development, for the benefit of the people in Southwark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two powerful checks to prevent what the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) described as asset-stripping, which is a pejorative term. The two powerful restraints are planning law and the hospital closure procedure, which must operate. The hon. Lady knows that if a community health council persists with an objection which it might have formed quite validly and logically, ultimately decisions will come to Ministers. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health has no proposals to change that basic procedure. They are two powerful and sensible checks to prevent a local authority behaving irrationally, but the basic thrust must remain to release surplus land and put it to better use for patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reinforce my hon. Friend's point and ask the Hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) to reconsider what she has said. No better example of what my hon. Friend said could exist than in the health authority which serves my constituency and that of my right hon. and learned Friend, the Secretary of State. The management is determined to flog off the dreadful old asylums and buildings in its area—which are a memorial to a Health Service which is over 100 years old—and replace them with facilities which will be an inspiration to all of us and provide the mental health care that will be required by my constituents into the next century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen in my travels around the county excellent modern facilities for the care of the mentally ill and handicapped. We have a very long way to go, but modern buildings providing for the care of smaller numbers of people than before in settings which are more appropriate to the latter half of the twentieth century are much to be encouraged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) is talking nonsense, and not for the first time. In the first place, the change in the length of time which many patients spend in hospital means that the wide grounds
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1293</span>
which many hospitals required in the old days—partly as recreation spaces for patients confined in hospital for long periods—are not as necessary as they were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, nearly all charities which contributed heavily to a hospital building programme knew perfectly well when they endowed the hospital that they were giving the land partly as an endownment for future protection of the delivery of the services. To use the land for that purpose now seems to me wholly inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say that I have been to some hospitals particularly hospitals for the mentally ill and handicapped, where the setting of the site clearly benefits the patients. We should not rush headlong into scrapping or selling every single square inch of land. In some cases, for the larger hospitals the setting is appropriate. Indeed, in greater London there are one or two hospitals, as some of my hon. Friends will know, where the setting helps to contribute to a sense of peace and quiet, calm and rehabilitation. Therefore, I would not myself argue that one should sell every single square inch of concrete or grass. Some land surrounding hospitals is appropriate, particularly for the care of the elderly and those suffering from various forms of mental illness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that far from my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) talking nonsense, she managed to elicit some valid information from the Minister which the Committee is now considering? If, as the Minister helpfully said, money which is identified with a particular client group should be spent on that client group, why should that not be written into the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to send the hon. Gentleman a copy of the circular that sets out the instructions. If hon. Members know of places where they are not being followed, I should be grateful if they drew my attention to them. The guidance is crystal clear. I should welcome the hon. Gentleman's views on the clarity of the instructions. It is not necessary to write the proposal into the Bill because our views are well known and we use an established procedure to communicate them to the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he felt that some sites in London, despite their high value, should be retained in the Health Service because their siting contributed to the welfare of patients. Will he tell us which sites he is talking about, as Londoners will be interested to know? It is a matter of public anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall not do that because it would not be courteous to the hon. Members whose constituencies contain the hospitals. A list of hospitals that I have visited in Greater London and my comments on them would not help the hon. Lady, the Health Service or the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the general principle. When Ministers examine the hospital closure proposals that come to us as a result of the regulations, one of our criteria is quality of care. If a hospital site were 20 acres, we would not wish land to be sold off so that there was no green space, but only a carpark or bricks and mortar and concrete. That may be necessary in central London, but in suburban London and the provinces there is no need to carry out our policy of selling off surplus land with excessive zeal. Common sense is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 20 deals with joint finance, of which we are conducting a review. I have read the new clause carefully.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1294</span>
It gives an option that we are considering. Joint finance resources will be £125 million in 1990–91. Options include: giving the money to the local authorities; giving it to the regional authorities; making no change in the procedure, which means allowing the DHAs to spend the money by making grants to local authorities; or something like the proposal in new clause 20. That would involve a centrally organised pump-priming initiative aimed at developing innovative projects by local authorities, housing authorities, and so on. When we have reached a conclusion later this year, we shall bring proposals back to the House, including any necessary legislative changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I thought that new clause 20 would help the Committee to focus on joint financing and joint planning. The Under-Secretary of State for Health is always succinct and is usually helpful especially in giving information. But his information about available capital, how the money is spent and the guidance on offer, including the circular reinforced our worries about the approach to joint financing. The Griffiths committee, the Accounts Commission and the Public Accounts Committee were deeply worried about how assets were being disposed of and about the money not being spent on the appropriate client groups. The Minister would not expect us simply to accept that information and do little about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepted the new clause—clearly he will not—that would go a long way to satisfying all these important bodies. It would ensure that scarce resources are properly spent in the interests of these client groups. As it seems that that will not happen I should say, with respect to the Minister, that circulars are not enough. If they were, we should have moved much further towards genuine community care and joint financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Minister's helpful information, we were not convinced by his reply. We should take a further meaningful and tangible step towards joint financing and planning, and the new clause would help to do that. We regret that the Minister will not accept the new clause, but the Committee should be given the opportunity so to do. For that reason, I invite the Committee to divide on the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who, I believe, will reply, and also to the Ministers from the Department of Health. Originally, we intended to table a new clause to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. If the new clause is criticised on drafting grounds, I accept such criticism unreservedly. I hope that the Minister who replies will not mind if I put this essentially Scottish new clause in a United Kingdom context. It may help to know that the new clause was inspired by section 11 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By not opposing section 11 of the 1986 Act, the Government have accepted, in principle, that it is reasonable for Parliament to be told each year what is happening in community care. Our discussions suggest that if Parliament received reports it would be better informed about community care. Moreover, some of the problems identified in our debates might be less serious if there were more accountability and parliamentary awareness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable disappointment. Not all the sections of the 1986 Act have been implemented. The Government's approach to section 11 seems remarkably vague and that is one reason for the new clause. Indeed, there is confusion about whether section 11 has been implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Hannam), who is the secretary of the all-party disablement group, received a written answer on 19 December 1989. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman; he is not a member of this Committee, but no doubt hon. Members will agree that he has done sterling work in these matters. The hon. Gentleman had asked a question about the report under section 11 of the 1986 Act and was told that it would be available
	<br><blockquote><p>"Within the next few days."—	<i>[Official Report, </i> 19 December 1989; Vol. 164, c. 770.]</p></blockquote>
A later reply to the hon. Gentleman states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The report was laid in draft before Parliament on 21 December last year. Copies will be placed in the Library as soon as they are printed."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 22 January 1990; Vol. 165, c. 	<i>555.]</i></p></blockquote>
About an hour ago, I went to the Library, and although it has a draft copy of the report, it has nothing else. That does not suggest much Government enthusiasm for implementing section 11 in a meaningful way. The draft report was placed in the Library in December and no other copy is available. If the Government have not even arranged for it to be printed, that does not reveal a wholehearted commitment to ensure that Parliament receives the reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is consistent with the view of the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation—RADAR —and of George Wilson. Incidentally, as George Wilson will retire fairly soon, perhaps the Minister will not mind if I pay tribute to him for the surperb work that he, like RADAR, has done. RADAR is worried that an important section of the 1986 Act, which is fully supported, does not seem to be recognised and supported by the Government. No doubt it would support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1296</span>
RADAR, consumers and others consider it important for Parliament to receive reports about what is happening in community care. I share that view and I commend the new clause to the Committee. Although I recognise the restrictions that I have placed on the Minister's response to these important views, I look forward to his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) on the basis that he suggested. I understand the reason why the wording covers Scotland. Perhaps I may deal with section 11 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. I understand the hon. Gentleman's criticism of the delay in laying a report before Parliament under section 11. A report for England was laid in late December. I understand that shortly we intend to lay a report before Parliament for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has torpedoed his own new clause by drawing attention to section 11 of the 1986 Act, which already provides for information to be given in the way proposed in the new clause in respect of mentally ill and mentaly handicapped people living in the community and in hospital. The new clause would require the Secretary of State to cover the same ground twice; the detailed statistical information that is published annually on local authority residential and day care services would be duplicated; and it would also repeat the comprehensive health statisticts that are published by the common services agency for the Scottish Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the new clause is a probing clause, and perhaps what the hon. Gentleman really wants is a commitment to look at the adequacy of the statistics on community care services of all forms in Scotland, which is precisely what we are now embarking upon. We shall certainly consult local authorities and the common services agency about a comprehensive review. It would take account of the need, for example, to have more detailed information about expenditure, because local authorities do not separately identify individual client groups when they estimate the cost of casework. Local authority and health board community care plans will set objectives in quantitative terms, as set out in the White Paper, and reviews will assess the progress made. The community care planning system will be a source of continuing information on the progress of community care facilities in individual localities, and under existing local government powers, the Secretary of State will be able to call for additional reports as necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These reports will be available, and I cannot believe that an additional report is needed. The preparation of such a report would only add to the costs of care in the community, without improving the service to persons in need. Hence I ask the Committee to reject a new clause that would add to bureaucracy and costs. We are just as anxious as Opposition Members to make progress and ensure that information is widely available, but on the basis of the assurance that I have given, I hope that the hon. Member for Monklands, West will make his contribution towards saving the rain forest by withdrawing the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am touched by the Minister's new found interest in the rain forest, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), were he here, would be even more touched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right, in the sense that we have focused attention on what is happening—or not happening—with section 11 of the 1986 Act. He is also right to say that this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1297</span>
is a probing new clause, and my hon. Friends will agree that we are wholly right to probe. Even this morning, the Library did not have copies of what is still described as a draft, and I am sure that the Minister, who is a fair man, will agree that that is entirely unacceptable, because the document was placed there on 23 December 1989. So if all that we have achieved was to encourage the Ministers to put that right, we have made some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to learn that the Library does not have copies, but I shall certainly look into the matter, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept our apologies for not making sure that several copies are available, still in draft form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I associate myself with the hon. Gentleman's comments about George Wilson, who is one of my constituents. In fact, I am addressing a conference organised by RADAR later this week. I have great respect for what he has done, and his retirement, when it comes, will be well earned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's intervention. My only worry is that his style may be infectious, and that the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, may respond in a similar fashion to civilised queries. We live in hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply, the Minister referred to Scotland, and I admit that what he said sounded helpful. If he really meant what he said, we have made some progress with him, too. But I shall be convinced that the Government mean what they say only when I see evidence that section 11 is fully implemented, and the only evidence will be a full-scale ' parliamentary debate on the report before the House. We shall be pleased if that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a further request. It would greatly help those who take an interest in the 1986 Act—section 11, and other provisions—if the Government were to publish a plain person's guide to its meaning. I apologise for adding to the problems of the rain forest, but it would much assist people who are disabled and those who are mentally ill, as well as their carers, who have to attempt to penetrate a great bureaucracy. I know that the Minister at the Scottish Office is a great private entrepreneur, so may I recommend to him the style of the Thames television guide? If he could apply that to Scotland, he would find few complaints. It would not cost a fraction of the advertising that is used for other aspects of policy of current interest to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have succeeded admirably in our intention of demonstrating how section 11 is not being implemented. Our vigilance will continue, and on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Minister will not tell us that this new clause will cause yet more bureaucracy and destroy more rain forests. When we hear the man who is the author of the poll tax in this country, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland—he is proud of it; he is one of its most fervent supporters—expressing concern about building bureaucracies and destroying the rain forests of the world, we are frankly amazed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Whenever there is any query about the poll tax paid by a household in which there are five adults over the age of 18, five communications go to the house, even though in many cases one would be sufficient. I realise that that is something of a diversion, but it is a bit rich for the Under-Secretary of State to start defending the rain forests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do believe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause goes to the heart of the principle of the Opposition's caring new clauses. One of the key objectives of paragraph 1.11 of the White Paper was
	<br><blockquote><p>"to promote the development of domiciliary day and respite services to enable people to live in their own homes wherever feasible and sensible".</p></blockquote>
The new clause would ensure that the people who were at risk and in need of care who were able to live in their own homes with the aid of services provided by a range of organisations—some local authorities and others private
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1299</span>
—would be cared for by registered people. Local authorities would then know that they were fit people to carry out that service, and there would be some control of the way in which they operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a precedent in that child minders have to be registered under the Children Act 1989. Children cannot be looked after for financial reward unless the local authority considers that the minder is a fit person to do so and he or she is on the register. Many people who need community care are in the same position as young children. They have difficulties coping with life and, without doubt, are at risk from unscrupulous people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would protect people in care by enforcing the registration of individual carers, and it would make non-registration a punishable offence. That would ensure control of the services provided by institutions and day centres. The Secretary of State suggested that day centres be registered. We have moved away from the idea that only residential institutions should be registered. The new clause would provide the logical next step, in ensuring that those who cared for individuals within their homes were also registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that the wording of the new clause is perfect. The Opposition do not have expert draftsmen to do the drafting for us. We try to make the Government accept principles by tabling new clauses. If they accept our principles it is up to them to provide the correct wording, if they consider ours to be incorrect. That is the Government's job. They put legislation before us and we suggest ways of changing and adapting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With this new clause we are pointing the Government towards an important principle. Even if there are faults in the wording—the Under-Secretary is entitled to point them out—I hope that he will accept the principle. He should argue about the principle, and not nit-pick through the one or two drafting errors. The Under-Secretary should tackle the problem of how to protect those who have come out of residential homes and hospitals to be cared for in their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important new clause, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond to it positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like everything that comes from the Opposition, the new clause has an element of interest, which might merit some emotional support. However, if one reads the new clause carefully one finds that wrapped up in its emotional appeal—what one might call its Scottishness—are all the flaws that have been referred to by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). It is rather like the roof tax, in that it is lengthy, complex, and would not be well received by the people whom it is intended to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect sometimes that everything that comes from the Opposition Benches is designed to discomfort me and my family. However, given the wording of the new clause, it is unlikely to affect me at all. Some of the other areas of the Opposition's activities are more likely to do so, in that one would expect to be disadvantaged individually and collectively, which is the case with the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is about people who will have to register, be examined and exempted, and so on. It makes the mind boggle. It is another example of the Labour party's efforts to solve the unemployment problem, because people would have to run around trying to find
	<span class='label label-info column'>1300</span>
out who falls into paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of the new clause. Frankly it is nonsense, and it should be exposed as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) in opposing the new clause. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) did not make its purpose clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is defective in several ways. It is very wordy and detailed, and it seems to embody the Labour party's approach to matters such as this, which is to believe that it is sufficient to ensure that the devil does no ill by passing a regulation saying that he should not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that my hon. Friend attacked the new clause for being wordy and detailed. I am sure that he would not apply that stricture to the new clause that I moved the other day, which was certainly wordy and detailed, but was also, I am delighted to say, accepted by the Government. It is not a law of nature, at least for new clauses from Conservative Members, that wordy clauses are wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made an interesting point. Anything that is wordy is not necessarily wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seems to follow the Opposition's practice of putting forward amendments that they hastily withdraw. They seem to be asking the Government the old question, "Have you stopped beating your wife?". That is the implication of most of the Opposition's attempts to put forward their views on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would bring several grave practical difficulties. It would be impractical to try to vet all the people working as home helps or domiciliary care workers. It stretches the imagination to suppose that that system could work effectively and efficiently. It is also a recipe for increasing the administration and the time involved, and, more importantly, increasing costs, probably to the detriment of the services that we are trying to protect. I accept that the Opposition generally try to give such protection, although, as usual, they have tried to do so with lengthy regulation. In fact, their aims can be achieved by a different means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Cheadle (Mr. Day) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) are right; the new clause is not a practical proposal. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that he had no doubt that I would say that it was a recipe for bureaucracy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I hoped that the Minister would say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he hoped that I would say that it was a recipe for bureaucracy, as, indeed, it is. I do not understand how putting names on a list would in itself provide the protection that the hon. Gentleman seeks. It would not guarantee that people altered their behaviour towards the vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intriguing that the hon. Gentleman thinks that the employees of private or voluntary agencies should be vetted, but that people employed directly by local authorities should not. The claim that standards differ between those two types of employee occurs again and again in the Opposition's argument. Local authorities will be responsible, through case managers, for ensuring that adequate standards are maintained, and it is a fallacy to suggest that a registration system could prevent abuse by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I1059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1301</span>
an employee in either the domiciliary sector or the residential sector. I have no reason to believe that people employed in the private sector are more likely to be unreliable than the employees of local authorities. In any case, through their consideration of contract arrangements, local authorities will be able to specify their requirements for vetting and supervising staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend private and voluntary sector agencies to provide domiciliary services without supervision and control from local authorities. If the hon. Gentleman takes account of that, I am sure that he will feel able to withdraw the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart may feel that a registration system is necessary. There will be further opportunity to consider extending the arrangements for arm's length inspection of residential care. We do not rule out moving towards more formal requirements in future should that be necessary, but I do not believe that the new clause is the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
