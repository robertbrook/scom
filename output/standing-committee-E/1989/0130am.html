	<div class='title'>RECOGNITION OF FUND-HOLDING PRACTICES OF DOCTORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 12, line 29, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'but no such fund-holding practice will be cash limited and have to limit the services purchased by the practice because of lack of funds'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 505, in page 12, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'1(A). No fund-holding practice will be denied funds where in the clinical judgement of a medical practitioner who is a member of such a fund-holding practice a patient on his list requires medical treatment.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 39 would ensure that fund-holding practices were not cash-limited. Fund-holding practices were originally to have been called budget-holding practices. But the word "budget" would have given the game away by implying a defined limit which must not be exceeded. The Government recognised that the measure ws deeply unpopular, but instead of changing the substance of the Bill, they referred to Roget's Thesaurus, and now we are debating fund-holding practices. Clearly, the Government think that people will feel that a fund will provide more money than a budget. We want to test whether the change in name from budget-holding to fund-holding practices is also a change of substance that will affect patients and doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper and the Bill imply that one sum of money only will be allotted for buying goods and services. The Government will say that the new system is voluntary, that only practices that choose to do so will become fund-holding practices, and that they can continue to operate as they do at present if they think that there will be insufficient money in the fund. Why have we been told that there have been so many volunteers, when we know that most GPs are bitterly opposed to the idea of a cash-limited practice budget? An opinion poll in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 18 May 1989 showed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"family doctors are … unhappy with Government proposals for them to hold their own budget. Only two per cent. welcome the plan and nine per cent. accept it in principle with a few reservations. The vast majority—76 per cent.—reject it altogether, while 12 per cent. have major reservations."
Some general practices will be driven into becoming fund-holding practices because, if they do not, they will lose their clinical freedom to refer patients to the hospital that they know will be best for them. Under threat of losing that vital clinical freedom, GPs will be forced to accept the lesser of two evils, and choose fund-holding practices. In an oral answer on 21 February 1989, the Secretary of State for Health said:</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"General practitioners who do not elect to have practice budgets will still have freedom of choice on referrals although they will have to work more closely with their district health authorities than hitherto in deciding on referral patterns from their areas."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 February 1989; Vol. 147, c. 820.]</p></blockquote>
What on earth does that mean? It is a load of old guff. I hope, Dame Janet, that when I am a Minister you will remind me not to talk garbage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This sort of argument brings politicians into public contempt. The Minister does not have the courage to face up to the fact that GPs will lose their right to refer. He says that they will still have freedom of choice, but that they will have to work more closely with their DHAs. That means that DHAs will choose. It is a pity that the Bill has not been more honestly represented. We discovered earlier in our proceedings when the Government rejected our amendment, that GPs and patients would not have the choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recruits will be driven into fund-holding practices by the loss of their right to refer. There will be a fundamental change in the family doctor service and the doctor-patient relationship. Why is that necessary? The Government have put forward not one shred of evidence to show that the family doctor service is expensive or not cost-effective. So why do we need to cash-limit it? If the Government intend to reject our proposal that there should be no cash limits, they had better give us evidence of why cash limits are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the immortal words of the Royal College of Nursing, the cash limit will put a price tag on every patient's head. It will contaminate the clinical judgment of family practitioners with commercial judgment. At best it will have a chilling effect. Every day of their working lives doctors will recognise that they are making not only clinical decisions but financial decisions. That will reduce their readiness to refer patients for tests and treatment. When GPs become budget holders, they will have not only a clinical responsibility to each patient, but a financial responsibility to other patients, who will need their services later in the year. They will think not just of the needs of the patient before them but of the needs of their other patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
GPs will also think of their responsibility to their partners: "If I spend too much money on this patient, I might not have enough money for my next patient. If I spend too much money on this patient, my partner might not have enough money for a more difficult case." The desire not to overspend will create in the heart of the system an incentive to under-treat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many decisions that family doctors make are borderline. It is a matter of judgment whether to send a patient for a test or to leave things for a while, or whether to send a patient for an operation. We do not want finely tuned clinical decisions to be contaminated by a tipping of the balance towards commercial and financial considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible that consultants will tell practices that it they become budget holders they may be able to secure earlier operations for their patients? The consultant might say that he can do an operation in a private hospital with which he has a contract but with which the DHA does not. Consultants will be in a key position in that they will almost be able to dictate whether a practice becomes a budget holder. Will not that inevitably happen under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He has pointed out how the introduction of fund-holding practices will pervert a series of relationships and arrangements. If many large practices become fund holding, life will be made difficult for DHAs. They will suddenly lose their funds and their ability to manage their hospitals. Consultants will view patients differently depending on whether they are from a DHA-managed, or fund-holding practice. Fund holding will distort the system in an unjustifiable way. If the finely tuned balance is tipped towards commercial considerations, and if there is a chilling effect, lives will be lost because tests that could show treatable conditions will not be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If evidence of over-treatment exists, let us hear how education, training, peer review and medical audit could deal with it. But there is no evidence of routine over-treatment. If it did exist, the blunt instrument of cash limits would not remove it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady explain why some doctors spend twice as much on drugs as others with similar practices, and why some doctors refer to hospital consultants up to 25 times as many patients as others from similar practices?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stray on to the question of drug budgets, because they come under another clause. But in response to the hon. Member's point, no one knows why some GPs refer 25 times more cases. Over-treatment is a problem that reflects poorly made clinical decisions, but so is under-treatment. If many patients within a practice have a skin problem and their GP knows that there is a doctor at the local hospital's skin clinic who has developed a treatment that will relieve the condition, the GP might refer all those patients, to the benefit of the quality of life. A GP in the neighbouring practice might not know that that treatment is available and consequently his patients will continue to suffer. The point is not that doctors are under or over-treating compared with a notional average, but whether treatments are appropriate for particular patients. Treatments should not be organised using financial considerations, as that would punish the GP who was over-treating, without anyone discovering the reasons for it, and reward the GP who was under-treating and causing suffering in consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not. I want to get on, and my hon. Friends want to contribute to the debate. Perhaps the hon. Member would intervene later, if I do not remove his anxiety during my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady saying that the next Labour Government would not impose budgetary controls on the NHS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, the cash-limited budget will have a chilling effect on the way in which doctors operate, and will poison the doctor-patient relationship. Patients now know that their GP's decision is based on his clinical judgment. If he said, "You do not need any tests, let's see how the matter goes; you do not need to go to hospital, I think that I can manage the condition myself," one would know at least that his decision would be based on his clinical and not his economic judgment. If the Government do not accept the amendment, patients will not know whether their doctor's decision is affected by his
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
budgetary system or his clinical decision. Sometimes it is hard for patients to accept that they should not take a course of treatment or go to hospital for tests or treatment. They have to have confidence in their GP when he says, "In my view, you really do not need that." They will not be able to trust him if they feel that his decision is merely an attempt to save his practice's budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Leicester, East) rose—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not give way to the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) anymore. I hope that you, Dame Janet, will be firm with him and use your power to suspend him from the Committee if he continues to interrupt my speech. However, I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Does she share the worries of Dr. Stuart Fraser, the local Leicester doctor whom she met when she came on a visit to meet real doctors, rather than the imaginary doctors that Conservative Members have met? He fears that the clause will lead to greater violence in his surgery. He feels that the public will deal with doctors as they deal with DSS officers administering the social fund. He feels that patients will get anxious, and may even attack doctors, if they believe that commercial considerations have overridden medical considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely; I fully agree with my hon. Friend. When patients go to a doctor they will not know whether his decision is based on their condition, on his concern about future patients or on his feeling of responsibility towards his partners. Patients will lose the confidence that they now have in doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the situation in the United States. The doctor-patient relationship has been poisoned by the involvement of money. If people have an insurance policy in the United States, they are liable to become the victims of over-treatment. Patients know that they are a good business proposition for their doctor if they have a good, fat insurance policy, so they seek many second opinions. For example, when a doctor says that a patient needs a major operation, to be filleted from head to foot, the first thing that the patient does is to take a second opinion, because he thinks that his doctor is trying to make money out of him. He does not trust his doctor. If a patient is in a health maintenance organisation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Is it in order for the Opposition spokesman to refer to surgical practice as "filleting"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chairman. The choice of expression is a matter for each hon. Member, unless it is unparliamentary. I do not think that we have quite reached that stage with "filleting".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) was such a sensitive flower. In deference to his sensitivities, I shall not use the term anymore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opposite of the problem of over-treatment in the United States is that of under-treatment in health maintenance organisations, which exactly parallel budget-holding practices. I visited the United States to talk to patients and doctors in health maintenance organisations.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
Doctors admit that there is a powerful incentive to under-treat. Indeed, that is why health maintenance organisations were introduced. Patients therefore feel that they are not getting the treatment that they need, which breeds dissatisfaction and mistrust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fund holding will also make it difficult for those with the greatest need to get the GP of their choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has talked about giving patients greater choice but the introduction of fund-holding practices will make that more difficult. Patients will not have a greater choice as the Minister claimed. Healthy patients will be at a premium, and unhealthy patients will be unattractive to a fund-holding practice. The Government claim that that is not so but it is already happening, in anticipation of contracts and other changes in the Bill. The Government say that they have no such evidence. Of course they have not: they are determined not to look for it. They refuse to acknowledge the evidence of letters and visits to surgeries of Labour Members. The Government refuse to collect information and figures that would show the extent of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cases that I shall cite are the tip of the iceberg. I want the Minister to investigate them and to assure the Committee that she will monitor the situation. Community health councils report a rapid acceleration of patients being struck off their GPs' lists. Elderly and chronically sick patients are being shaken out by GPs who are considering the effect of those patients on the income of their practices. The Government talk about the market signal and market forces and GPs respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) received an anonymous letter from Essex on a GP's notepaper, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Cook,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I think you should know that local practices"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Is it appropriate for the committee to be subjected to a quotation from an anonymous letter, which anyone could have written? It is meaningless in the context of the debate, and the hon. Lady devalues her case by quoting from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not have thought that that would worry the hon. Gentleman. It is certainly not a point of order for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local practices are now actively involved in getting rid of patients (and refusing new ones) if to do so would damage immunisation and cervical smear figures. I cannot reveal my name as my partners are involved." </p></blockquote>
I have a letter from a doctor in Bradford to one of two elderly patients—at the patient's request, I shall not reveal the patient's name or that of the doctor—which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having read through the new contract which Mr. Clarke has forced upon us next year, it is clear that, with more work in the Surgery and much more paperwork to do, we will not have the time to do the visiting which we have done in the past. We will, therefore, have to restrict ourselves to patients living within a reasonable distance from the Surgery, and as it is a 15 minute journey to your home we must ask you to register with a GP with a Surgery closer to you. I am sorry to do this after 27 years—we haven't fallen out and will still, I hope, be the best of friends, but we must have time to achieve the new 'targets' and this is just one of several letters which I am writing to our outlying patients."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
That letter was sent by the doctor in response to the Government's current and future changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) raised with the Minister a letter which Dr. Durkin of Lancashire sent to his patient, Mr. Bramald. The letter reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has changed the way we are paid. We can no longer afford to keep on our lists patients who use above average the "On Call" doctor service at nights or weekends."</p></blockquote>
It finishes with a threat:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Please let us know when you have registered with another doctor so that we can send off your medical records. If we do not hear from you we will write to Preston and ask for your names to be taken off our list and your next doctor will then know that you have been removed."</p></blockquote>
The patient to whom that threat was addressed gave this explanation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My little girl has a heart complaint called 'Aortic Stynosis' diagnosed by Dr. Wright at 'Blackpool Victoria Hospital'. It was he that said, 'any symptoms of this condition manifest themselves immediately, call out your local GP.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As I did not know that the Government have set a '£s per patient care system' on, I wonder just how many other people genuinely ill will receive such letters."</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately the situation is worse than that. When asked by 	<i>The Times</i> to account for this situation, the doctor said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I came here to look after the health of the people of Burnley but the Government's White Paper is forcing hard new decisions on doctors about the way they conduct their business."</p></blockquote>
That is a foretaste of what is to come. I have raised the case of Mrs. Jackson with the Secretary of State. Mrs. Jackson arrived home from hospital to discover that she had been struck from her GP's list. Her son, who was healthy and lived in the same house, was able to remain on the list. She was struck off because of the changes in the contract due to the deputising services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is urgent. The Government must call in family practitioner committees and ask them to consider carefully what is happening. Patients' choices are already reduced: their choice of new doctors, and of staying with their existing doctors. The Government pretend they know nothing of what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dame Janet, the problem is that the changes in the GP contract foreshadow the financial decisions which GPs will have to make when they become fund-holding practices.

There is a defect in the hon.

But the hon. Lady did not say that, at present, a GP may refer a patient to a consultant when more expensive treatment is required. A consultant operates within cash limits. The moment a patient leaves his GP and attends a hospital, he will see someone who operates under cash limits. Is the hon. Lady really saying that there is no confidence in what consultants prescribe because they operate within a cash-limited regime? She did not say that because it would not be true. People have confidence in consultants who work within cash limits and it is also possible to have confidence in GPs under the Government's proposed regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones (Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that no one is beyond redemption and so I tempt the Minister and his colleagues to consider the amendment and GPs' budgets in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the intervention of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and to what seemed to be his primary objection to Labour's amendment. He attacked the Opposition for not wanting doctors' budgets to be called to account if they overprescribed drugs in a certain way and thus overran their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment, No. 505, introduces a new element into the debate and meets some of the objections raised, such as those voiced by the hon. Member for Pembroke. It means that no doctor, whether or not he has a budget, should be denied funds if in his or her clinical judgment a patient needs medical treatment. The doctor would have to justify that clinical judgment before the extra funds were provided. That meets the Government's objection to Labour's amendment head on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment offers the Government a choice and tests of their sincerity. The Government have said that no practice would be denied funds to enable doctors to treat patients. But they have not written that into the contract. We must test the Government's sincerity and allow them the opportunity to include in the Bill—with no hesitation or drawbacks—the provision to enable a doctor, in his budget, to treat a patient in a certain way if in his or her clinical judgment that patient needs such treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) highlights some interesting and challenging statistics? Some practices in Wales, within very short distances of each other—no doubt this applies throughout the United Kingdom—have dramatically different morbidity and mortality rates. Doctors' perceptions of the causes of those morbidity and mortality rates will also be very different, as will their perceptions of how best to treat them. If the freedom to prescribe does not exist, people will worry even more than they do now about the application of the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his timely intervention, which highlights some of the problems that will arise if doctors are given their own budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note the hidden extras or sweeteners to tempt doctors who may not have hitherto considered applying for a budget to do so. It is remarkable that all the pressure and sweeteners have come from the Department of Health in England. Some GPs, of course, have expressed an interest. But none of those pressures has been applied to practices in Wales that would qualify under the provisions. As a result, not one GP practice in Wales has expressed interest in obtaining a budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ian Grist)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Minister the opportunity to intervene again. Will he confirm that in reply to a parliamentary question that I tabled not so long ago, he said that not one GP holder had applied for his own budget?

	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
beginning to express an interest. A natural conservatism and caution is to be expected. There is an increasing interest, however, which I anticipate will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for that information. It proves that, on the basis of the original information, doctors in Wales were not interested. I am afraid that the Minister is now saying that sweeteners similar to those that have been offered to GPs in England have been put before GPs in Wales. It would seem that they have been put under considerable pressure. In recent months, we have had regular reports on GPs' practices in England which show the pressure of them to apply for budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to read the prospectus entitled, "Funding General Practices", which has been issued to doctors who have expressed an interest. The section in that prospectus that is headed "Contracts with Hospitals" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is, of course, unknown territory."</p></blockquote>
What a way to present a new concept to the medical profession. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a budget-holding GP you will be exploring a completely new way of providing health care for your patients."</p></blockquote>
I doubt whether that will instil confidence into many GPs who might wish to apply for budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important also to consider how the proposal for GP budgets would radically change the way in which the NHS has developed since 1948. Medical practitioners argue that the trust and confidence which has existed hitherto in their relationship with patients would be undermined by a new financial constraint which, at best, would create uncertainty and, at worst, could lead to confrontation. It was put to me that rather than the patient-doctor relationship being based on mutual trust and confidence, there would be a new breed of GPs who would be nothing more than armchair accountants, looking at the end of the year to see whether savings could be made in their budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When GPs make savings from their budgets, they will be able to choose how to use them. They can plough them back into patient care, into new equipment, or into developing their buildings. Let us imagine that a doctor's practice has that opportunity. The doctor comes to the end of the financial year knowing that the budget must be spent—if it is not, questions will be asked—and he has to make a choice: to spend the money on patient care or on mending a leaking roof at the back of the practice building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This introduces an element of financial consideration into the way in which doctors operate—an entirely new concept. Hitherto, there would have been no hesitation, because the money would have been ploughed back into patient care; but given the choice, all doctors would have to look at it hard-headedly. Which choice would they make if they had a waiting room which needed upgrading, or a leaking roof? That would be a very difficult choice for many GP practices, and it is the sort of choice which a budget would give a doctor over and above his relationship with his patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must look briefly at the administrative costs allied to the budget, because we are told that the administrative costs for a practice taking a budget would be £32,000 a year. If every practice which could take a budget were allocated that, the administrative costs would amount to about £150 million a year, which is an enormous sum. However, there are two parties to a contract, so there
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
would be a corresponding cost for the administration of those contracts by the RHAs, the FPCs—soom to be known as family health services authorities—and, of course, the hospitals. Can the Minister tell us whether the administration costs on both sides of the contract have now been worked out and what they are likely to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress a matter which concerns me. What is proposed will fundamentally change the relationship between doctor and patient. The Government tell us continually that doctors have been misleading their patients about the nature of the proposals and that patients who write to us expressing their concern do so out of a misunderstanding fostered by doctors who feel it in their interests to misinform them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that most of the people who write to me are sensible, intelligent and genuinely worried that what is proposed will fundamentally alter their relationship with their doctors. They are not easily misled. They have confidence in their doctors and they want it to be maintained, and the doctors are telling them that the choices which they will have to make will mean that they will not be able to provide them with the sort of care which they have provided in the past, because of the financial constraints which will be imposed on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the important point raised by the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)—the proportion of elderly people in society. Let us imagine that a budget has been allocated to take into account the number of elderly people in a practice. However, if we have a bad winter, the number of elderly people who fall ill will be higher than in normal years. The Government will say that they have taken that into account and have budgeted for the higher proportion of elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, all GP's practices know that the cost of their practice in such a year will be much higher than in the original budget. What will the Government's answer be? Will they increase the budget or tell the doctor, "Sorry, you have had your budget. The amount of elderly people in your practice has been taken into account. There is no more money for you."? The Government have not explained what would happen under those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would confirm that such practices would be given more funds. It would be sensible if the Government agreed with us and accepted the amendment, through which we seek to enshrine in legislation the principle to which they adhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that when we reach the end of the debate on the amendments, the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) will answer the pertinent points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), particularly on consultants' cash limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham referred to cash limits as if they had never existed in the Health Service. That is strange, since repeated assurances have been given that, at practice level, such cash limits will not apply. Will my hon. Friend the Minister for Health reassure the Committee on these points, and repeat the assurances which have been given on numerous occasions but which should be given again? The budget level for a fund-holding practice will be set individually for each practice that takes that option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Budgets will take many factors into account: for example, current practice, the sex, age, and percentages of patients in various categories, and current prescribing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
patterns—as well as any other potentially high-cost factors that may be relevant. If, during the year, a practice were to find itself with insufficient funds to meet the demands on it, it would be able to discuss that with the FHSA, and the budget could then be adjusted accordingly. I hope that, at the end of the debate, both the hon. Member for Peckham and the Minister will address these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall some speeches that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) in the Health and Medicines Bill Standing Committee. She made the point—I echoed it during some of my contributions—that the Bill was a paving measure for other more serious steps that the Government would take in the direction of moving GPs' practices towards being independent health businesses. She predicted that; Opposition Members echoed her predictions; and she has been proved correct. We could see where the measure was leading and we see it before us again in this clause. The philosophy underlying the opting out of hospitals and health services is that patients will benefit from competition between the separate units of the NHS, from setting up a business relationship between its various elements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I profoundly reject this philosophy, but I am interested in the Government's limited defence of the clause. The main justification that has been churned out several times today is the alleged evidence of over-treatment. I have yet to see the evidence, although various references have been made to it by Conservative Members. I suspect that there may be evidence of over-treatment in a very small number of practices; and that there will be reasons for it, one of which may be the market philosophy that permeates the marketing of drugs. I have witnessed in my area the lavish entertainment that drug companies heap on doctors in an attempt to entice them to use drugs which, in some instances, may be highly questionable. The vast majority of GPs take a fairly cynical approach to such marketing, but certain doctors accede to drug companies' attempts to persuade them to buy their sometimes questionable products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am making is the unsuitability of a market model in health care, because it will lead in certain instances to inappropriate prescribing. It is profoundly unhealthy to allow drug companies to market their products by entertaining and, in effect, by bribing doctors to use their products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) replies, may I say again that that question relates to other amendments to other clauses? Hon. Members must relate their comments to the amendments about fund-holding practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect your ruling, Dame Janet, but I am expressing my concern about the philosophy that

underlies the clause, because it applies the market model to health care. I profoundly believe that the market model is wholly inappropriate to health care, to the interests of my constituents and to people in other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another issue to be considered: the clear differences between practices. Practices do not treat the same kind of patient or cover the same kind of area. I have evidence of that from Wales. Worry was expressed about a certain practice, but when the matter was looked into, local industry was found to be the cause of chest complaints and there was good reason for patients there being prescribed more medicines than patients in other practices. Areas can have special problems. That is true of Wakefield, particularly of the eastern end of the district, where many men have devoted their lives to coal mining and now have severe chest complaints. According to the Government's logic, certain practices in my area could be accused of over-prescribing, but it is the result of a health problem caused by the mining background of men in the district. No doubt the same is true of the area of my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of our worries about funding of this type is that doctors will no longer be able to prescribe drugs to ease pain. I accept that such drugs may be psychotherapeutic, but the fact remains that they work. I shall produce evidence later about a practice in Neath in Wales which was investigated by the Ministry, and the reason for its so-called over-prescribing discovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have warned the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) before that we are straying into another clause and other amendments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move away from the subject of drugs, Dame Janet, because I accept what you say. But to respond briefly to my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone, I think that the Neath example is the one that I had in mind, and it clearly illustrates the problem of proving over-prescribing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real motivation of the clause is the Government's market philosophy. Conservative Members are so steeped in their worship of mammon that they fail to understand the antogonism between that philosophy and the interests of the health consumer—the patient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Harlow): Let us suppose that the hon. Gentleman for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) is absolutely right—I do not accept for a moment that he is—and that doctors' budgets will be dreadful for both doctors and patients. Surely the answer lies with GPs. The budgets are voluntary. If they are as bad as the hon. Gentleman says, doctors will not take them on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I shall argue against it shortly by relating it to the responses that I have had from GPs in my area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham said that economic, budgetary an accountancy decisions will determine the way in which many doctors will in future view their patients. That is worrying. An article was written in "The House Magazine" by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) —all of us hope that he is making an excellent recovery —in which he described how the clause will distort the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
patient's view of the doctor. My hon. Friend, who is an eminent medical man, said that patients come along suffering from viruses, probably like the one from which I have been suffering for a few weeks. In my case, my GP prescribed a course of treatment and said, "Frankly, there's not a great deal that I can do. Eventually your body will deal with the virus naturally."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said in his article that it is now medical fact that patients often cannot be offered instant solutions. He said that GPs should say, "Give it a couple of weeks, and eventually your body's mechanisms will cure it for you. There's nothing I can give you." Many patients will accept that now, but there may be undesirable results if, as my hon. Friend said in his article, they think that the GP's decision is based, not on their interests as patients, but on concern about the practice's accounts. There may even be the problem, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) said, of GPs being assaulted by patients. This is a major problem, and it will affect the doctor-patient relationship in ways that, I suspect, the Government have not considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) raised the question of GPs having the choice of whether to opt out. I have corresponded with many practices in my constituency of Wakefield. The logic behind the opting-out proposals of Wakefield health authority is negative: "If we do not do it, we shall be penalised for not doing it." Similarly, the correspondence that I get from GPs shows that they have reservations and anxieties, but that they are worried about what will happen to them if they do not go along with the proposals. Theirs is not a positive decision, welcoming what the Government offer. It is a negative decision, because GPs fear that if they do not accept the proposals, they will be penalised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from referral patterns, on which the hon. Gentleman knows that DHAs are consulting GPs, will he itemise the areas in which doctors feel that they will be penalised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As long as I have known and loved the NHS I have believed that general practice is its linchpin. It is the main point of contact for so many patients. It is one of its major successes and I am sad that the Government should put forward a proposal that will take us back to the situation in this country before the NHS was established by the Labour Government in the 1940s. I hope that the Government will listen to the serious points that my hon. Friends have made, and to the reservations of the medical profession, as expressed in briefs from the BMA; and that they will concede that they have made a mistake and will return to a commonsense approach to general practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it would be helpful if we clarified whether drugs are relevant to clause 13. Working Paper 3, entitled

	<br><blockquote><p>"Budgets will meet the cost of the following services".</p></blockquote>
It runs through hospital services and on page 5 ends up with "Drugs prescribed and dispensed." On page 9 it goes further into the question of practice budgets and the relationship to drugs:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a practice participates in the Practice Budget Scheme"—</p></blockquote>
the forerunner of our fund-holding practices—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the element within it for drugs will be an actual allocation rather than an indicative one. Where a practice dispenses drugs to patients, the budget will exclude remuneration in respect of dispensing activity".</p></blockquote>
That is important, because drugs will make up a substantial proportion of the allocations given to fund-holding practices. I may, if it is in order, refer to drugs during my remarks on fund-holding practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I pulled up other hon. Members it was because they were clearly straying into indicative budgeting.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Dame Janet, fund-holding practices will not have indicative drug budgets. They will merely have an allocation for prescribing which is part of their overall allocation. I shall therefore bear your words in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret the tone of the Opposition's attack on the clause. The clause is one of the most exciting developments that my right hon. and learned Friend and my hon. Friends have proposed for the Health Service. It will make GPs' practices far more accountable, for choices and for outcomes for their patients—that is all to the good. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) was wrong about cash limiting, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) made clear. Referring patients from general practices to hospital services inevitably transfers their treatment from a non-cash-limited service to a service that is firmly cash-limited in all aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not remind the Committee of my chairmanship of a health authority, but cash limiting funds to DHAs helped spur the review that produced the Bill. The apparent shortfall in funding has led health authorities rashly to close beds, wards and even hospitals. The hon. Lady has therefore got it wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham did not make it clear, although she referred to it, that no practice will be forced to take on a fund-holding position. It will be a voluntary scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one advantage that the Government will give to budget-holding practices is that doctors will be entitled to send patients wherever they wish, to see any consultant, whereas a GP practice without a budget will be able to send patients only to hospitals with which there are contracts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly the hon. Gentleman is right. Fund-holding practices will have a wider choice when referring patients for secondary or tertiary care than will be available through DHA contracts. Many practices will not become fund-holding practices; only large, sophisticated practices with back-up will do so. The GP practice that I have attended for the past 15 years has six doctors, many patients and full staff. Such a sophisticated
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
operation will be necessary to take on fund-holding status, which is an entirely new way for doctors to make decisions on behalf of their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Minister for Health and the Under-Secretary, when reviewing the allocation of money, will need to be flexible early on. The system will be revolutionary in its operation. The hon. Member for Peckham drew parallels with health maintenance organisations in the United States. They are irrelevant, because the provision of money for health care in the United States is entirely different. We shall retain the principle that care should be free at the point of delivery, which is not the case in the United States. Health maintenance organisations have also operated in the litigious and defensive environment of United States medical practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an exciting development that will give GPs greater choice and more say in the outcome of treatment for their patients. They will choose between a pharmaceutical regime or hospital intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall need to take account of the experimental nature of fund-holding practices and 1 hope that Ministers will reassure us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention the pharmaceutical element of the allocation only because the Bill lacks clarity in describing pharmaceutical services. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I corresponded on the subject. He stated that in indicative budgets, the pharmaceutical services refer to the ingredient cost of the items and leave out containers, pharmacists' expenses, fees and so on. I want the Minister to clarify that the same description of pharmaceutical services is envisaged within the allocation to fund-holding practices. That is important because it substantially affects the amount of money involved and the complexity of pharmaceutical treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We reject the Opposition amendments and look forward to the introduction of fund-holding practices with excitement rather than dread. However, we must be aware of the experimental nature of the measure. There is flexibility within the allocation to move funds between separate budget headings. I hope that RHAs and family health services authorities will also be flexible, especially in the early days, in allocating the funds. They should bear in mind that moneys may be needed later in the fiscal year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate my support for clause 13, with the above proviso, and ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), in making a plea at the end of his speech, contradicted himself. I reiterate the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones). Flexibility in the first year will be difficult because of the scale of the stampede towards practice funds. The reason is not that the doctors like the idea. It is because that is the only way in which they can retain some individual medical control and thus circumvent or avoid the implications of clauses 3 and 4 and the contractual arrangements elsewhere in the Bill. That stampede, for the wrong reasons, will make flexibility more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not contradicting myself. I am not opposed in principle to the budgets being cash limited. However, they should be flexible in the early days because they will be experimental.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman clarified his position. However, the overall figures,especially the amount of £32,000, might mean that nationally the scheme will cost—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I appreciate that many hon. Members want to debate the measure, but I appeal that the Minister be allowed to reply so that we can press him on certain issues. We gain nothing by the way in which the debate is being conducted and people outside the House learn nothing. It is the Minister we want to go at, no one else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chair. Any hon. Member may suggest that it would be appropriate for the Minister to reply earlier in the debate, but it is not a matter of order. I can call only those who rise and seek to catch my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A different point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Dame Janet. I have heard Labour Members complain on many occasions in Committee that Conservative Back Benchers say nothing. My hon. Friends and I care about the NHS and we are speaking out, and Labour Members do not like it. We have as much right to speak in Committee as they have. The reason for the intervention is that shortly the press will arrive and Labour Members want to stage a little demo. They do not want to listen to the argument, they want to walk out to encourage industrial action. They are not interested in real debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is clearly not a matter of order for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all interested in the Ministers' response to our debates. They have a role in contributing to the debates on each clause and amendment. I suspect that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has done a fair amount to frustrate Ministers and others in having their say in Committee and I shall not take such strictures from the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As much as 8 per cent. of the NHS budget for patients will be required if the scale of application and incentive reported is accurate. As the hon. Member for Gillingham said, it is difficult to see where the savings will be made in the existing NHS budget to pay for the bureaucratic overheads that will be generated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some specific items have caused anxiety in the medical profession. I mention them now, before the Minister replies, because I want her to respond to them. The first is information technology. In the press release dated 13 December 1989, the Secretary of State stated that information technology was crucial. He announced incentives to GPs and stated that funds would be available from 1 April. Many doctors in general practice and in the hospital sector worry about the pace with which information technology is being implemented and their own readiness. Does the Minister believe that further, urgent efforts should be made to hasten the introduction of that technology? Without it, it will be difficult to make the reforms work. I shall not stray from the clause, but general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
practice is linked to hospitals because of referrals to consultants. Will the Minister say how the cost of computerising hospitals, including recall and exchange-swap facilities, will be met?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two questions about the new GP fund-holding arrangenents. Will savings from the budget be treated as income for tax purposes? Secondly, will the funds holding management activities of GPs and RHAs be liable to value added tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two issues are arousing concern and interest, and it would be useful from a probing point of view if the Minister could introduce some clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone listening to some of the speeches made by Opposition Members would think that budgeting was a new and wicked idea introduced by the Tory party. Of course, it is nothing of the sort. All of us—individuals, companies, organisations and clubs—have had to work to budgets, almost from time immemorial. Indeed, the nation has a budget, as we shall be reminded on 20 March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), for Cheadle (Mr. Day) and for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) have said that budgeting is not a new idea in the NHS. Many parts of it have been working to budgets for many years, and I have not yet heard an argument from the Opposition to explain why doctors should be exempt from budgets. Indeed, we know that some doctors like the idea of being able to work to budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has told us of the number of practices which have shown an interest in becoming budget-holding practices, and perhaps the Minister will tell us what the thinking is behind the figure of 11,000. As I understand it, a number of doctors with smaller practices are interested in having budgets and would like to be considered for that. Perhaps we can introduce some flexibility into the figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been emphasised repeatedly, whether practices become budget holding will be completely up to the GPs concerned. All that the Bill does is enable doctors who wish to have a budget to have one. There is no pressure on them, and if they do not wish to have a budget, they need not. It will be purely voluntary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have made it clear in many ways and at various fora that there is no question of funds drying up and a practice having to put up a notice saying, "Sorry, closed because funds have run out". The White Paper makes it clear that there will be a margin of 5 per cent. overspend in any event, and that if a practice overspends its budget, the budget will be reviewed. It is surely not unreasonable—indeed, it is sensible—that a doctor, when considering what sort of treatment he will pursue with a patient, should take costs into account. That, of course, will be only one factor. There are many factors to be taken into consideration when deciding the appropriate course of treatment, such as the quality of care and the patient's personal convenience. Surely it is not suggested that cost should be completely ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it offensive to doctors to suggest that they are likely to pursue inferior treatment for a patient simply to save money. That would be against all the ethics and training of doctors. I accept, of course, that there are black sheep amongst the profession, and as a member of the General Medical Council I have perhaps seen a little more evidence of that than others have. The black sheep,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
however, are very much a minority. I believe that the majority of GPs will continue to do the very best for their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell us exactly what the mechanics of setting up these budgets will be. I understand that they are to be set for the RHAs. Will the authorities negotiate with each individual practice to determine what is an appropriate figure for its budget? The FPCs are to be involved in the administering of budgets. Will they form part of this negotiating process, and is it intended that the names of practices which have their own budget will be published?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two genuine concerns among GPs and patients about the general idea of fund-holding practices. One is the extent to which budgets can be adjusted in mid-stream, the point made by the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) about the onset of an epidemic. What happens if a patient develops a condition which needs particularly expensive treatment? What happens if a doctor is asked to take on to his list a patient who is already having treatment or likely to have treatment involving heavy expenditure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, pharmaceutical companies are continually undertaking research and bringing out new treatments. If a new drug which has prospects of great success is produced for a particular complaint, but is rather costly, will the doctor who wishes to prescribe it have his budget increased so that he may prescribe it without overspending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about new treatment and things which might happen in the middle of the financial year. I hope that he will press the Minister to tell us exactly what the budget mechanism will be, because as we know, diagnosis now is going forward in leaps and bounds in many areas of medicine, particularly in the treatment of heart disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady adds weight to my point. As with other aspects of Government reform, some very good ideas have been subject to a lot of scare stories from a variety of motives, often because of misunderstandings or inadequate information. I very much hope that the Minister can correct those misunderstandings and fill in some of the missing details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After years in which professions have been getting more choice and more experience of running their budgets, it is surprising that the Labour Party should oppose an opportunity for doctors to join in the procedures which other professions now have for budgeting at their local place of work where the money is spent and therefore to have direct control over their budgets. With schools of 200 and 300 pupils now being allowed to have their own budgets and barristers being accountable for their budgets, it seems strange that the Opposition should deny to another profession—the doctors—the opportunity to have their own budgets as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where does the hon. Gentleman get the notion that barristers have budgets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who is a solicitor, should realise that barristers have clerks and they have to budget. They have to make out bills, account to their clients and put forward tariff charges when they are negotiating a bill. Of course they have to budget, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
they are responsible for their money. Nobody else except the barrister in his chambers is responsible for the money which he spends and his income and outgoings. What we are trying to do is enable doctors to have the same professional responsibility, which will mean that doctors will have complete freedom of choice over whether to employ more nurses in their practice and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I seek your advice on a matter of great seriousness to Opposition Members, and to Conservative Members, I hope, and not a matter for laughter. You will be aware, Dame Janet, that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingstone (Mr. Cook) is currently doing his best to persuade the Government to solve the ambulance dispute, which is causing— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the point which the hon. Gentleman is making. I am extremely dubious as to whether it is a point of order for the Chair. I suggest that he comes to the point quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Dame Janet. The ambulance dispute is a matter of great concern to all of us in this Room, as are the clauses in this Bill. The clause under consideration now will damage health care, but the ambulance dispute is causing more immediate damage, particularly to those who require the assistance of ambulances. My point of order is that a meeting is taking place in the House today to enable right hon. and hon. Members to express their wish for a resolution of that dispute. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will attend. I appeal to you, on behalf of Opposition Members to adjourn the Committee for 15 minutes, to allow hon. Members on both sides to attend the meeting. Judging by the noise that they are making, Conservative Members may learn something from the experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chair. My overriding duty is to ensure that the Committee proceeds. If some Committee members feel that other duties are of greater importance, either temporarily or permanently than their attendance in Committee it is for them to decide individually. The Committee must proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. A few moments ago the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) handed out press releases which made it clear that Opposition Members intended to walk out of Committee in support of the ambulance workers. That is a matter for them, but is it not a gross discourtesy to Committee members who want to debate the Bill? The Opposition have accused Conservative Members of not wanting to debate the Bill; yet remarkably, a moment ago the shadow chancellor walked into Committee so that he could walk out again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Manchester, Withington): On a point of order, Dame Janet. I understand your ruling on the earlier point of order, but I urge you to reconsider it. Thousands of people in my constituency are protesting today because they realise that their local Health Service has already been damaged, and they are worried about the implications of the Bill. They believe that the further damage caused by the ambulance dispute must be put right, and they want all Members of Parliament to take the dispute seriously. The dispute can best be resolved by showing clear support for the ambulance workers. If the Committee adjourned for 15 minutes only, hon. Members could show their solidarity with the ambulance workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not possible.

We accept your ruling absolutely, but as a courtesy to you I point out that Opposition Committee members will have a token representation here for the remainder of the morning, because in the interests of parliamentary democracy, and with respect to you, some of us will listen today to people from outside the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already explained, it is not for me to judge Committee members who feel that their duties outside Committee are more important than their attendance in it. I merely say that the Committee must proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Could not the difficulty have been avoided if the Secretary of State had today made a statement to the Committee? He has had notice for many weeks of today's demonstrations throughout the country, and he knew that the matter would be raised in the House. Has not the Secretary of State been negligent, by failing to make a statement to the Committee about developments in the ambulance dispute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As you may have noticed, I have been attempting to catch your eye all morning. I appreciate that you may wish to call more distinguished hon. Members before me.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I seek your ruling, which I shall accept without question. Is not it correct that, if the Opposition proposed through you to the Minister that the Committee adjourn for 15 minutes, you could put that to a vote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is a matter for the Chairman's discretion whether to accept a motion for an adjournment. In these circumstances, I should not feel able to put such a motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. You said that you would not adjourn the Committee if an hon. Member asked for that. If a Government representative sought an adjournment to show that Conservative Members understood the seriousness of the ambulance dispute might you consider it, especially as that would be seen to be the wish of all Committee members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I raise the point of order with you, Dame Janet, I do so in the hope that Government representatives on the Committee will demonstrate their understanding of the importance of this issue and their wish to resolve it. I realise, however, that Opposition Members have the freedom to make the difficult choice between the clause and the meeting on the ambulance dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not give rulings on hypothetical situations. All I have said is that if such a motion were proposed, I should have the right not to put it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that for the past eight minutes my speech has been interrupted by the Opposition's meaningless sound and fury. It is a pity that they put demonstrations before Parliamentary democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Given that the hon. Member is complaining about interruptions to his speech, it would be better if he returned to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made the point that I wanted to make. I shall make two other points as I am anxious to hear my hon. Friend's reply. Voluntary budgets will allow doctors the freedom to choose to employ nurses and buy desk-top computers and diagnostic equipment for their surgeries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way to the Opposition, who have deliberately tried to disrupt the Committee, and most of whom have walked out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. We have had constant disruption and delay from Conservative Members who have been encouraged to extend the debate, though they are clearly not interested in these serious issues. The hon. Member's comment was grossly one-sided and unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair. All that matters is the relevance of hon. Members' speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —To employ diagnostic equipment. This would be a fundamental improvement in doctors' conditions. It is nonsense to say that doctors will be limited in their budgets and that patients will be turned away. An assurance was given in the White Paper that if a patient were to need a large sum of money spent on him—over £5,000—for special treatment, that money would be made available from the local health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is to remind the Committee that budgets are not new in the NHS. When I was a councillor on a London borough, as my hon. Friend, the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) was, the RAWP—resource allocation working party—procedure was introduced in 1976 by the Labour Government. We went through many
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
traumas, but it was an important exercise which we supported. We believe that the NHS like any other part of the public service, as well as private companies, has to learn to live within budgets. It must be accountable and ensure that we get value for money. That cannot be achieved if we do not know how the money is being spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish with the challenge I made earlier to the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) who unfortunately has other matters to attend to. Would the Labour party do away with budgets in the NHS? We had no answer from her then and do not seem to have one now. Perhaps the hon. Member representing the Labour party's position will make this clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to some of the comments that have been made. The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) has demonstrated some of the difficulties among Conservative Members in getting a reasonable and rational position on this issue. He suggests that doctors should have to account for the money spent in their practices. That is clearly the case now. He asked why doctors should be exempt from a cash limit on the finances available for running their practices and it has been suggested by Conservative Members that some doctors would like to have a budget to work to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not necessarily the best of doctors would be keen to have a budget limitation and to keep within it. The best doctors will always have in mind two criteria: first, the best possible treatment for their patients, and secondly, the proper use of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members will have shared the experience of talking to doctors on many occasions and know the responsible way in which they approach the spending of money both within their practice and in the Health Service generally. It is a gratuitous insult to doctors to suggest that they need an artificial cash limit on the spending of their practice in order to make them responsible in the use of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a doctor is unwilling to say to a patient that a particular form of treatment is not needed, there is something he can hide behind, because the doctor can then say there is a limit on his finance because the Government have placed a cash limit. A responsible doctor will want a patient to understand why he or she has taken that decision and why a course of treatment is inappropriate or cannot be pursued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman had the opportunity of reading the Select Committee evidence given by my right hon. and learned Friend, the Secretary of State when he made it very clear that those GPs who take voluntary budgets will be given a very loose rein indeed and that anyone who wants treatment will not be denied it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read those comments in the Select Committee reports and what has been said on the Floor of the House and elsewhere and in documents circulated by the Department. It makes it all the more difficult to understand why the amendment is being resisted. We are being given undertakings outside the Bill, but there is resistance to accepting the amendment. The amendment is modest and would simply add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but no such fund-holding practice will be cash limited and have to limit the services purchased by the practice because of lack of funds."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
It would not remove doctors' responsibility to exercise constraint in the use of their funds or take away existing sensible constraint that can be extended within the operation of the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the Bill strikes a balance between the obligation to give patients the best possible treatment and the obligation to act responsibly with public money. The Bill places all the emphasis on cost limitation. We shall discuss a detailed element of that when we examine the indicative drug budgets, but it certainly applies to practice budgets. The Bill puts accountancy rather than treatment of patients in the driving seat. The amendment would remedy that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some doctors in Wales have expressed interest, as have doctors elsewhere, but I suspect that those expressions of interest are guided more by the fear of the constraints and pressure which the measure will place on them. It places them between the devil and the deep blue sea. Do they decide to go for the practice budget, as the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) suggested a few moments ago? They will see the carrot held out by the Government as encouragement—that is, that they will be looked after if they choose the practice budget. Or, do they keep to the present system, knowing that it may lead to their unpopularity with the Government and Health Service administrators? That could considerably constrain their freedom to do what their training and Hippocratic oath demand: to give their patients the best possible care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until now, a GP has been regarded as the person who cares for, works for and is the advocate for the patient, as well as the intermediary between the patient and the Health Service, its administration and financial controls. That will go unless the amendment is accepted. The financial constraint will exist and it will be increasingly difficult, because of the way in which democracy works and places constraints on those working within it, for doctors to give absolute priority to patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the undertaking that there will not be a cost limitation on a practice budget such that patients will lose out on treatment. If Ministers are willing to give that undertaking, why will they not accept the amendment? That is the salient question which the Minister must answer. When the Minister for Health responds to the debate, I hope that she will give a clear answer. If the undertakings which she, her right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and other Ministers have given mean anything, if the written undertakings from the Department of Health, Welsh Office and other Departments mean anything—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I will not stop for Conservative Members. I have referred to the salient question that we want the Minister to answer and I suggest that they listen to what I say. Let the Minister answer this question: why do all these fine words exist outside the Bill but the Government remain unwilling to accept amendments which, like this one, would include an assurance in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example of the sort of constraints that could be on the Health Service as a result of the part of the Bill relating to care in the community, which we shall debate in the coming weeks. A case that I dealt with recently—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member embarks on that subject, I should say that I cannot see how it relates to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My next sentence will show the care with which I am keeping to the terms of the amendment, Dame Janet. Any patients suffering from a mental health problem who are in the community, not in hospital, contact their GPs for treatment while out of hospital. Many people with mental problems now spend 90 per cent. of their time in the community, and therefore 90 per cent. of their care comes from GPs. When there is care in the community, there are often crises. They consume an enormous amount of the time of GPs and other elements of the community health services, and one must question whether the money that is available to a fund-holding practice will be sufficient for that purpose. That, as I am sure you will accept, Dame Janet, comes within the terms of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is a direct consequence of the proper movement towards community care within health and social services. But the facilities for care must exist in the community, and there should be no budget restraints on GPs to prevent them from giving medical care to patients who are not being treated in hospital. Weight of numbers can cause problems; it puts severe pressure on many inner-city practices that have a considerable number of patients "in the community". Such patients can be demanding in terms of time and medication, and also in terms of their crises. Often, in the case of schizophrenia, early medication can prevent the patient from having to return to hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know a young man in my constituency over whom I have agonised with his parents and the specialist. Every now and then there is a crisis, and the doctor is called out. When it is left a little too late for minimum medication to solve the problem, there is pressure on the general practice and, inevitably, on the Health Service as a whole. It is not the sensible way to deal with the problem, but it makes it all the more important for the GP to be able to take preventative steps and have time to devote to the patient. Preventive medication at any early stage can avoid hospitalisation, with all the heavy costs that that involves over weeks and months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many aspects of medical care cannot be predicted, quantified or placed in categories. Following a heart transplant, we know that there will be expensive medication for a long time to prevent deterioration and infection. For such a patient, it is possible to categorise and quantify a figure, and I understand the Government trying to bump up the practice budget to cover it. That, however, is the tip of the iceberg. What is important is the unquantifiable part under the surface of the water; account must be taken of that unquantifiable part if practice budgets are to be realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot quantify the number of people who suffer from schizophrenia or the number of people with a continually recurring medical problem in a particular constituency. Although there will be a burden, we cannot predict accurately the number of people suffering from post-industrial diseases—pneumoconiosis and respiratory complaints—in many communities in south Wales. Such cases will be a burden, but civil servants will not be able to quantify them accurately enough to guarantee that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
will be no constraint on the individual practice budget and thus no distortion of the care that will be given to each patient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not only the constraint on the budget that is worrying? As any money that may be left in the budget at the end of the year will be shared among the doctors in the practice, will not that encourage practices to take shortcuts, which will ensure that some money is left at the end of the year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed; my hon. Friend made the point well. The proposal gives the wrong message, and will create a climate in which the wrong decisions will tend to be taken. If the Government create an ethos in which accountancy comes first and medical care second, as they intend to do, inevitably decisions on the use of the practice's budget will be constrained by that ethos. I have seen correspondence that specialists in hospitals are sending to one another. They are occupied more with ways to bring income into university departments than with improving the standard of medical care. The priorities are therefore wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic proposal in the amendment is that there should be sensible constraints on the use of money within the Health Service, and that GPs should be given responsibility for the way in which they use their money, but that the overall priority should be the health care of the patient. There is indeed an order of priority, and there must be a balance between those elements. However, unless the amendment is made, the clear message will be given to doctors who either choose or are pressured to adopt a practice budget that finance rules the day in determining the treatment that patients receive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Doctors reject the proposal for practice budgets. They believe that such budgets will have an adverse effect on patient-care and on patients' relationships with their doctors. The BMA is clear about that. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) said that only 2 per cent. of doctors welcomed the plan. Doctors recognise that a conflict between doctor and patient could develop if a patient felt that access to medical treatment was being denied to him or her because of cost considerations. Every member of the Committee will have been lobbied by his or her local GPs on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had numerous letters from GPs in Halifax. One, from the St. John's Health Centre, where Drs. Clay, Spencer, Nunn, Galvin, Parry and Garnett practice, remains in my mind. They wrote to me early in the discussions about the Government's proposals, and, so far as I know, they have not changed their minds since. They wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are extremely worried about the implications of these proposals on our work and feel that we must make our views known before it is too late. If it is correct that the government are determined to make General Practitioners budget holders, I'm sure you will appreciate that this will produce a conflict of interest on the part of the General Practitioner between his duties as a financial controller on the one hand, and his duty to provide adequate care under his terms of service for his patients on the other."</p></blockquote>
They are clear about that. I, and other hon. Members, have stacks of letters on the subject. 	<i>[Interruptions.]</i> As for replying to sedentary interjections—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Lady continues, I shall repeat that I object to sedentary interruptions. I wish to hear the hon. Lady in relative peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is no question about it: clinical decisions will be compromised. I want the Minister for Health to give a categoric assurance that, should the proposals go ahead, people will not suffer. I feel that they will. Women on expensive fertility treatment who wish to transfer to another practice will be disadvantaged. A practice will think twice before it takes them. Will women who want to take advantage of developments in fertility treatment, but whose GPs are budget holders be referred for expensive forms of treatment? Will the elderly patient with kidney failure in Halifax be referred to Leeds for dialysis three days a week when a few pills and sympathy might be the cheaper option? It is right to refer to patients with chronic conditions. As they are often more costly to treat, they will be at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the chronically ill and the elderly, will not general practices be in the same position as opted out hospitals? The authorities that are moving in the direction of independent trusts have in mind services that will create a surplus. The services for the elderly and the chronically sick will not create the surpluses that can be made in some areas of acute medicine. will it not be the same with general practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He has put the argument in a nutshell. There is a worrying trend of shaking out. I shall give the Committee a few examples from my constituency over the past two or three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Timothy Byrne is a chronically sick emphysema sufferer confined to a wheelchair, who needs much medication. he and his family were disturbed two or three months ago to find that they had been struck off their GP's list. It has been inconvenient and distressing for them and difficult to get somebody else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tracey Reynolds, a young pregnant woman in one of the not too well-off areas in Halifax, was told that she was not on the list when she called her doctor to attend to one of her children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another case, which arose last week, a young mum, who is now four months pregnant, found when she went to visit her local GP that she had been struck off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but she is straying into amendment No. 536, which is not yet before the Committee for consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to explain that the trend for practices to shake out patients who would be financial burdens has already started. The three cases that I mentioned are all disadvantaged people from poor areas, who might call a doctor more often than others and who might be more costly to the practice. Two of them were young single parents, lacking confidence in caring for children and worried about what will happen to them. That will become the norm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to finish with what doctors have said about clause 14. The BMA made it clear in its briefing document that it believes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"patients requiring expensive and costly treatment might join the practice. The effects of the budget would have to be assessed and renegotiation with the FHSA considered. This would be a time-consuming exercise but one which would need prompt action.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There are a number of factors, such as weather and epidemics, which cannot be predicted accurately on a yearly

	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
or monthly basis. Budgets would therefore have to make provision to these factors."</p></blockquote>
I want the Minister to tell us about the mechanics of the provisions. How will more money be put into the service? The Minister must reassure us about specific provisions, especially those for women who want specialised treatment. I hope that the Minister will give us details, not merely a five-minute overview of what everyone else has said. We are worried that our constituents will have a much worse Health Service than they have now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 13 is a major part of the Health Service reforms. It will give GPs the opportunity, voluntarily, to become fund holders. It will mean that, for the first time, they can back their clinical judgment and seek what is best for their patients. We believe strongly that GPs are the gatekeepers of the NHS. They are on the front line. They know and understand what their patients need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has often not been possible for GPs to provide appropriate and flexible services and to use their purchasing power in the best interests of their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been great progress in general practice in the past 10 years. Their spending has risen by more than 50 per cent. There have been dramatic increases in practice staff and in the number of GPs. The clause offers GPs the opportunity to give more meaning and weight to their wish to do what is right and best for their patients. They will be able to use any savings from their practice fund, if they choose to join the scheme, to provide further services. They could take on more staff or move those savings between headings in budget. The service will thus be less stressful and more convenient to the patient. If the doctor decides to provide more services at the practice, less time will be lost, and the practice will give the GP much greater satisfaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that savings could be made. Will she say how those savings could be spent? Could they be spent on the expansion and development of buildings, the freehold of which is owned by the members of a group practice? If so, might they be subject to taxation, which was referred to earlier. Could the savings be spent on the purchase of vehicles for the use of members of the practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may, in due course, want to make his own speech. The resources in a fund-holding practice can be spent for purposes that serve the interests of the patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will they be spent on the items to which I have referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They can be spent on items that serve the interests of the patients. Anyone who understands the present system of GPs remuneration will appreciate that often good general practice is scarcely rewarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. It is important that we establish that Ministers' responsibility in Committee is to answer questions on issues that have been raised with us by those outside the House of Commons. I was asked about the matter that I raised and if the Minister cannot answer my questions, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
ask that the Committee be suspended. It would be improper to proceed to a Division unless we have clear answers to our questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is sufficiently experienced to know that that is not a point of order for the Chair. It is a point of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forsyth knows the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear to the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that it is a matter for debate, and not a point of order. If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene in the Minister's speech, he may seek to do so. If he wants to raise the matter in his own speech, he will have the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been excessively tolerant, perhaps, of the hon. Gentleman throughout our proceedings. I ask him to do me the courtesy of allowing me to develop my argument and to speak on the amendments before intervening and disrupting my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money to which the hon. Gentleman referred can be used to invest in and develop services for patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be used for motor vehicles. It will reassure hon. Members to know that fund-holding practices will be required to produce annual reports on the way in which their money is spent and on the development of services. They will also be required to make monthly reports to the FHSA. The FHSA can intervene and take action if it believes that the money is being spent improperly or if patients needs are not being met. If the FHSA believes that the fund holder is not conducting the business adequately, it can withdraw the fund-holding facility. The practice accounts will, of course, be subject to audit. As fund-holding practices will be subject to such constraints, the hon. Member for Workington can be satisfied that the fund holders will be able to exercise their good will and ingenuity in providing the best services for their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No patient will be refused treatment by the need for financial resources. We have said time and again that we do not intend to cash limit at the practice level the funds available to practice fund-holders. Funds will be allocated at each practice according to the age and sex of the patients, the number of chronically sick and disabled people and other potentially high-cost patients on the list. Previous hospital and prescribing patterns will be taken into account. The fund will be subject to discussions and if the practice believes that the fund will not meet the needs of their patients it is free to walk away. There is no coercion or compulsion; it is a voluntary scheme to enable GPs to provide their patients with high-quality care. If, during the year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall proceed. During the year a practice might consider that its budget is likely to be insufficient. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones

	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
asked what would happen if there were a flu epidemic. Other hon. Members spoke about patients needing particular treatments who might join the list. If there were an influx on to the list of patients who required very costly drugs or special treatments, it would be open to the fund holders to discuss the matter with the family health service authority, and if necessary the budget could be increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the budget could be increased in mid-year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am saying. I am pleased to have conveyed that point to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that assurance. Am I right in assuming from her earlier comments that the practice could relinquish holding a budget in mid-year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In normal circumstances, the practice would be expected to complete the year to which it was committed. Regulations will provide for exceptional circumstances under which a practice could close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister assuring us that the allotted sum can be exceeded at any time of the year? If so, can we assume that she intends to accept the amendment? If she does not accept our amendment, we cannot accept her assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Discussions about the budget and about any special circumstances may take place with the family health service during the year. The region will be expected to have contingency funds to meet any unforeseen circumstances. Many of my hon. Friends have made it clear that the amendment would run a coach and horses through our attempt to instil into the Health Service good management and the proper use of resources. Time and again Opposition Members preach the need to disregard financial matters in the provision of health and welfare services, and other services. We have an excellent record in increasing resources in the Health Service, and we believe that the clause, without the amendment, will ensure that GPs can meet the needs of their patients. No patients will be refused the treatment that they need because their fund-holding practice runs out of money. I make that absolutely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that a RHA can, in mid-year, increase the budget of a fund-holding practice if it proves necessary? I ask the question for the benefit of the Opposition, who seem to doubt her integrity on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case, and the region will have a contingency reserve for precisely such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) spoke about the wish of GPs to become—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had hoped that hon. Members had progressed beyond the fourth form—perhaps I should say the second form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that GPs would become fund holders only because they would feel that they would have less power as GPs outside the system. Certainly, fund-holders will have special levers and influence. Last week, my right hon. and learned Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
Secretary of State said in Committee that some GPs had been approached by hospitals that had scarcely regarded their interests as long as they could remember. Suddenly, for the first time, GPs will have the power and influence to do what they want for their patients, to ensure quality, and to provide the flexibility that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But so will GPs who are not fund holders, because under our provision for the way in which the DHAs will operate they will have to consult GPs about where they want their patients referred and the normal contractual arrangements for their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned about the suggestions that patients might be removed from the list for arbitary reasons. The proposals for fund holding go alongside the new GP contracts, of course, and you, Dame Janet, will be the first to say that it is not the subject of the debate on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions. First, on the question of GP practices which ask for more money in a particular year, would that increased allocation flow through into the following year, so that each budget would be adjusted upwards for additional money which they take in the financial year in whih they ask for it, or would the cash-limited budget for the region mean that money would have to be taken from other budgets to fund the increased allocations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it has been said that a GP practice could walk away from the budget. Would it then be free to spend what it wanted, or would the FPC, as I still call it, cash-limit the budget? Would walking away mean a reduced allocation or more money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about GP practices which were given additional resources within the year and the effect of that on their budgets for the following year. It might be thought that the request for additional funds was well-founded and that there were arguments for modifying the budget, but it would, of course, be a matter for discussion. Each year the budget will be reviewed, in the light of the evidence, the patients and the criteria. If, as my hon. Friends rightly say, practices are not happy with the arrangements, they can withdraw from the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to those who withdraw from the system, I think that it would only be in exceptional circumstances that someone would withdraw from the system in mid-year. In such cases, however, the DHA of the resident population would pick up any outstanding contracts, and the other responsibilities would return to the family health services authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Peckham about the discouragement to have particularly needy patients on lists. In the GP contract, we have made clear our belief that there should be a greater recognition of the additional cost of elderly patients—people over 75. It would be premature to anticipate the results of the review bodies, but the Government have made a clear commitment in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that all hon. Members will recognise that in setting the budget we have said time and again that those with special conditions will be able to make representations, so there will be no disincentive to take on especially needy cases. If, however, there were evidence that one particular fund-holding practice had behaved in an arbitrary and less than positive manner towards its patients, that would be taken into consideration when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
deciding whether the fund should be allowed to continue with that practice. I urge people who are concerned about particular cases to take them up in the first instance with the FPC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am determined to press on. I hope that I have dealt, in effect, with the point about bad weather.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On administration costs, we have made it clear that assistance is available, and there will be a £32,000 management fee. The practice, however, will have to satisfy the family health services authority that that money has been properly spent. A total of £250 million has been allocated this year to the development of review implementation, and this, of course, is part of that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) asked about information technology, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will probably do justice to that subject when we reach clause 14. Practices will need to be computerised to take part in the scheme. We are developing a specification for the software that practices will need to run the system, and it will be available to them later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) mentioned flexibility on the size of practices. We said initially that 11,000 was the proposed size, although in some instances we have reduced it to 9,000. We pointed out that some practices may join together to achieve fund practice status. We shall of course consider reducing the criteria further, as we progress. We shall refine and develop the process as we go along, and we shall learn the best way forward in the light of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked how the process will work. I urge Committee members to read the programme for funding general practice, which sets out in detail the steps to be followed. Practices will be invited to register with the RHA if they wish to become fund holders and to work together with FHSAs in the registration of interest. Once it is established that there is good management and the necessary information technology, they will work together
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
to talk about the components of the budget and how they can be costed. They will receive support from the RHA and the FHSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the pharmaceutical component, the indicative budget deals basically with net ingredient costs. On the drug component of the fund-holding budget, we shall deduct the amount from the discount and add on the container price. The fund will not include any element for pharmacists' remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, the clause is very much a force for good. Anyone with experience of general practice knows that there are few incentives to good practice—some GPs wish to screen, perform minor operations and fulfil their obligations to their patients—and that those incentives are often purely in the direction of prescribing or referring on. By holding a GP fund, GPs will be able for the first time to develop their services as they wish. They will be able to back their judgment about how to provide high-quality patient care. This is a vote of confidence in our GPs. It is a GPs' charter, and it is a voluntary process. No patient will be refused the necessary treatment because of a fund-holding practice running out of money. I therefore urge my hon. Friends and others to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish only that the Minister's speech had been made approximately two hours ago, because we could have had time to disentangle the complicated conclusions that the Minister has put to the Committee, many of which, in my view, are ill considered, ill conceived and will create immeasurable difficulties for GPs.
