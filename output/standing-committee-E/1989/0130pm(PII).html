PAYMENTS TO RECOGNISED FUND-HOLDING PRACTICES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 537, in page 13, line 30, leave out "the case of a" and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"respect of each financial year, the Secretary of State shall be liable to pay to the members of each".—<i>[Mr. Freeman.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Amendments made</i>: No. 106, in page 13, line 31, leave out "Practitioner" and insert "Health".</p>
<p>No. 107, in page 14, line 17, leave out "Practitioner" and insert "Health".</p>
<p>No. 108, in page 14, line 36, leave out "Practitioner" and insert "Health".—[Mr. Nicholas Bennett.]</p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 538, in page 13, line 31, leave out from "Wales" to end of line 33 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"a sum determined in such manner and by reference to such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 580</span>
factors as the Secretary of State may direct (in this section referred to as an 'allotted sum')".—<i>[Mr. Freeman.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 514, in page 13, line 33, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) The Regional Health Authority shall for the first year of any recognised fund holding practice:
<ol>
<li>set a nominal figure for the allotted sum;</li>
<li>pay at the end of the year further sums to match any costs incurred by a fund holding practice under subsection (6) below, over and above the allotted sum;</li>
<li>take into account for the following year any costs incurred over the notional sum when setting a figure for the allotted sum for that year.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment is based on the fact that the GPs' budget is a considerable, radical step into the dark. Surprise has even been expressed in that context by the American partial inspirer of the proposals, Professor Enthoven, that the Government were not proposing to embark on formal pilot schemes, not least because the figure of 11,000 is considered too small for GPs to have the necessary financial clout. I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on pilot schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Couchman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. It is almost impossible to hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying because of the hubbub from the Opposition Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right but, unfortunately, hubbub can arise from Conservative and Opposition Members in turn or simultaneously. In other words, there is no cause for self-righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try not to speak in a self-righteous manner, Dame Janet. The purpose of amendment No. 514 is to tease a little more out of the Government in respect of how they envisage the process working, not least with regard to the RHAs. Ministers have suggested that there will be a learning curve. Will there be sufficient scope for flexibility in the new system to take account of the budgetary problems that may arise? The important argument about pilot schemes should not be overlooked. Under the amendment, the RHA would set notional figures and then take into account retrospectively what had happened during the course of the year and assess any implications that may have arisen. There would be merit, in England and Wales, in developing a pilot scheme. The thrust of the Government's proposal would not be lost; that degree of flexibility and building in that learning curve would be a gain.<br><br>
The Scottish health Minister is running what could be described as pilot schemes for some health boards in Scotland. The principle is not offensive to the Government. They are willing to try out some aspects of the Bill to see what lessons can be learnt in advance, or to build in flexibility as they go along.<br><br>
Amendment No. 514 would allow the Government a little more flexibility. That may have been echoed by Government Back Benchers, who have been pushing for a pilot scheme so that mistakes or malfunctions are avoided. I would be interested in the Minister's response to the detail and practicality of the amendment, and to the broader principle of allowing flexibility rather than going for a blanket nationwide

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 581</span>
imposition and discovering whether mistakes, errors or overshoots can be corrected only once the scheme is in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman is addressing himself to amendment No. 514. We do not plan formal pilot schemes for GP fund holders. Applications received so far for funding holders in England run into several hundreds. The potential number of practices with more than 11,000 patients is about 1,000. In an intervention, my hon. Friend the Minister for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said that we are considering individual practices with between 9,000 and 11,000 patients, which would widen the base. We already have several hundred applications, which is most satisfying. It is a vote of confidence.<br><br>
We propose during 1990-91, the financial year to come, to pay to those practices that have expressed a serious interest in proceeding the sum of £16,000—one half of the management account that we would pay to those who carry forward GP practice funds into 1991–92. That amount will be an augmentation of £32,000 per annum. We shall pay £16,000 in the preparatory year to help with the introduction of computer systems. The hon. Gentleman will recall that we shall pay fund holders about 75 per cent of the cost of the computer hardware and the cost of installing the systems that will be needed. During the year 1990-91, the Department and the family health service authorities will be working with potential fund holders.<br><br>
The White Paper referred to £700,000 as an example of an appropriate sum to be negotiated. The actual amount allocated for the legitimate purposes of expenditure by fund holders will vary widely—from £500,000 to as much as £1.5 million. During 1990-91, we shall be negotiating with each practice to set the amount. As my hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) said earlier, it will be a sum with which both parties—the potential fund holder and the RHA—are happy.<br><br>
During 1991 we shall be working to explain to fund holders that although practice staff reimbursement and improvements are cash limited at the FHSA level, expenditure on drugs is not cash limited and therefore at the practice fund level the aggregate sum is not cash limited. I was asked about that by the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman).<br><br>
9 p.m.<br><br>
During the coming financial year we shall be working with potential fund holders and considering the consequences of overspending. For the convenience of the Committee, and of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), who touched on this today, I emphasise that we have withdrawn the proposal on page 13 of working paper 3, which was for a mechanism by which overspending fund holders would be checked.<br><br>
We do not intend to proceed with our proposals for checking a 5 per cent overspend, but on the basis of monthly reports, and fuller annual accounts, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
FHSAs will check the rate of expenditure—as will the fund holders—against their accounts to ascertain where overspending arises. There will be no interruption in the flow of medical services by a fund in the course of a year. If a GP fund-holding practice needs to prescribe drugs and to provide medical services, it will be able to do so, and we will look at the overspend after the end of the year. If the increase that is agreed at the beginning of the year is legitimate, it will be rolled into a higher base for the next year. That answers the question asked by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). If there is no sound reason for the additional expenditure, we shall seek to introduce for the succeeding year the lower base to which the practice should have been keeping during the previous year.<br><br>
Finally, we shall, during the coming year, be drafting regulations to allow for the moneys that result from underspending to be kept by a fund holder and the items that the underspend may be used for. The hon. Member for Workington referred to several categories, and my hon. Friend the Minister alluded to them. Our regulations will specify precisely what the money can be spent on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it appears a little hard for me to explain what I wish to say, it is because I have had more than one glass of wine for dinner this evening, and it is now 9 p.m.<br><br>
When decisions are being made in the subsequent year and an estimate is made of whether the additional expenditure incurred in the year of an overspend has been valid, is it true that the FPC of the RHA might challenge the expenditure on referral and put it to the general practitioner that he would have done better to proceed in-house in the budget-holding practice rather than making referrals? Would that not in future have the effect of interfering with what might otherwise be the more experienced judgment of the budget-holding family practitioner in what he decides should be referred, as against what he decides he should deal with in-house?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that analysis. It is true that of the categories of expenditure appropriate for GP fund holders—which we shall specify in regulations and further directives by the Secretary of State—virement is possible. That means that practices can move expenditure from head to head between staff, improvements, drug prescribing, hospital services, diagnosis and so on. As my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Tayside, North said, a large pot of money will be agreed voluntary. It will give the practice great flexibility to decide how to spend resources to obtain the best possible care for its patients.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his explanation. Can he assure the Committee that GPs, who have been economical with their practice, will not be able to put the proceeds in their back pockets and, in a sense, profit from the expenditure of public money, which should be reserved for public purposes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to confirm that. Expenditure of underspend must be for the benefit of patients, whether on facilities, health promotion and so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0662">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
As my hon. Friend the Minister for Health said, the tax consequences have still to be clarified, especially for consequential capital gains tax to which the hon. Member for Workington referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that capital gains tax liability will be assessed, but that will not influence whether a capital gain has been made at the beginning. We were trying to establish whether unnecessary investment in property, perhaps in excess of the immediate requirements of the budget holder, might take place. The Minister has not assured us that such investment will not occur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to be patient. He knows that the Bill is an enabling measure. Regulations will be made under clauses 13 and 14 to specify the precise categories of valid expenditure by fund holders and also how surpluses may be spent. When the Bill is enacted, the regulations will outline in great detail, without trying to be inflexible, the correct way in which fund holders may proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that if a budget holder overspends, he would be brought back in the following year to the base on which he should have been spending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister said that GP budget holders would be pulled back the following year to the budget that the practice had been allocated, if the overspend for the previous year was considered unreasonable. If that is not correct, what will happen to the overspend from the previous year? Will it be taken out of the new budget for the following year, or will it be written off as long as the GPs agree to bide by the new budget set for the following year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us consider an overspend that is identified only after the year has ended and when there is no suggestion that patient services will be halted during the year because of a prospective overspend. An overspend can fall into one of two categories. If the overspend is valid—for example, if the RHA, on the advice of the FHSA, genuinely did not allocate enough to the budget—it will be rolled on. It will be consolidated into a higher base for the next year. As for an overspend that is not valid, the budget holder will start in year two with the original base, as adjusted for other appropriate reasons because the demography or patient list may have changed. There is no suggestion that the money will be recovered from the fund holder. If there were persistent overspending, the sanction to which the hon. Member for Peckham referred, when we discussed clause 13, would be to withdraw the fund. I hope that hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye will not press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, although it was tangential to amendment No. 514. None the less, our intention was to bring out the Government a little more on the possibility of some flexibility. I consider that pilot schemes would be more sensible than what is proposed. The Government argued for them in discussions about the Griffiths report and the case is stronger for die changes that are now proposed. The Minister, however, is clearly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
determined to press ahead. We can wish him only well, although I anticipate trouble further down the line. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It had been my intention at this juncture to turn to some of the issues that we rehearsed earlier with the Minister for Health, but she is no longer here. I regret that it is not the first time in my life that the lady has fled on knowing of my presence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of us are made of sterner stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps there will be other opportunities to discuss the specific matters that I had intended to raised.<br><br>
I seek your advice, Dame Janet, on the central question of the funding allocation system. Debates on clauses 18 and 19 might be an equally appropriate forum, rather than take the Committee's time now.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I spoke to my hon.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
the hon. Gentleman. I want to hear whoever has the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to explain further the way in which drugs will be charged to the budgets of fund-holding practices. It was not clear from the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister for Health this morning.</span></p>
<p>9.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can be brief and draw the distinction between the way in which charging is proposed for indicative budgets and for GP fund holders. I shall take the simpler, indicative budget first. What will be charged to the indicative budget is what we call the basic price. That is spelt out in the document "Funding General Practice: Working for Patients", published by the Department of Health. The basic price of a drug—it will be essentially a tariff, and I use the word advisedly—will exclude the cost of the container and the negotiated discounts that the pharmacist and the dispensing GP may negotiate. It is a basic price, standard throughout the country and it relates to the drug itself. When the indicative budgets are fixed by the family health services authorities they will take into account the prescribing needs of the patients on a doctor's list.<br><br>
The system for the GP fund holders is a different concept—namely, the true cost to the NHS. To the basic price—the tariff for the various drugs that doctors will prescribe and some will dispense—will be added the cost of the container, because fund holders will need to take it into account. The average discount that prevails throughout England will be subtracted. We can calculate the average discount because that discount, negotiated by the pharmacist, is passed on to the NHS and to the taxpayer. That represents the actual cost of dispensing the drug to the patient.<br><br>
I hope that that is clear. My hon. Friend may want to refer to section 5 of the document "Funding General Practice: Working for Patients" where the proposals are set out in detail. If my hon. Friend has any problems, I shall write to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us when we can expect the letters that we were promised last week?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recall two letters. I promised a note on capital charges. If members of the Committee do not have it already, they will receive it tomorrow morning or later tonight.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are not exact carbon copies of their English and Welsh equivalents, as the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, complained on the BBC radio programme, "Good Morning Scotland". However, their principle is similar. The clauses that relate to Scotland are nearly carbon copies of their English counterparts. I accept that there are some differences in clause 30, and I shall refer to them in due course.<br><br>
If, as Ministers claim, fund-holding practices will not be cash limited it should be on the face of the Bill, not left to the assurances of Ministers, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Peckham (Ms. Harman) said.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0664">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
That is even more important in Scotland, because only the Bill can be produced in evidence in a Scottish court. A Minister's assurance would not be accepted. There is no reason to reject the amendments if it is true that the budgets of fund-holding practices will not be cash limited.<br><br>
The people of Scotland have responsed to the reforms in the Bill with scepticism and cynicism and the amendments would help to reassure the Scottish people. The public, the patients and the medical profession are anxious that the Bill will mean poorer services for patients. They fear that those who have chronic medical problems will find it difficult to get on to a GP's list, especially in a fund-holding practice. They are anxious that they may not be referred to a hospital because the GP may run out of money.<br><br>
The Minister may assure us, as his hon. Friends have done, that that is not so. He must accept, however, that there is geunine scepticism. It is not good enough to say that the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats have won a propaganda battle within Scotland and throughout the rest of the United Kingdom on the issue. I wish that that were true. We have won the general propaganda battle against the Tory party in Scotland but I am not sure that this battle is any different from the rest. It is grossly insulting to the electorate, which includes GPs and medical experts in Scotland, to suggest that the Labour party can delude them into believing something that is not true by using black propaganda. The Minister must try harder to convince us that the amendments should be rejected.<br><br>
I assume that the document "Funding General Practice: Working for Patients" will form the basis of the Minister's remarks, and I shall refer to it. Perhaps I, too, am sceptical and even slightly cynical but if the budgets are not cash limited, I do not understand what is in it for the Government, nor can I see the point of the proposal. For 10 years the Government have said that they want to cut public expenditure. That aim is at the core of everything they do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not wish to mislead the Committee about the Government's views, which are very clear. They want to get the best value that they can from public expenditure. It is misusing the English language, as the hon. Gentleman regularly does, to describe that as cuts. One cuts when one makes reductions, not when one makes additions and aims for better value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a reduction. I was describing the Government's policy. Their constant plea, and especially that of the Under-Secretary of State, has been for a reduction in public expenditure. The Under-Secretary of State has said that that lies at the core of the Government's philosophy. I am therefore not sure what the Government hope to achieve by the measure, unless they reduce expenditure on health throughout the country.<br><br>
I am not clear what GP budget holders will achieve. What is in it for them? I am not sufficiently cynical to believe that GPs are only in it for themselves. They are hard-working, honest people who do a tremendous job. They are also human beings, and generally they want
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
to maximise their incomes so far as they can. What will they achieve from entering the scheme that the Minister has suggested? He will argue that they will be able to provide a more efficient service because they will be able to run it themselves and deal with their own budgets. In Scotland, GPs will have to work in large group practices, almost health centres, to achieve the 9,000 to 11,000 list that we have discussed. There will be very few in rural Scotland. Only 5 per cent of general practices will be covered by the measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my constituency, which is substantially rural, mere are already moves afoot for doctors to have budget practices. That shows that, as ever, the hon. Gentleman talks about Scotland, but knows very little about it outside Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman has said. If he cared to read his own Government's documentation, he would discover from the Minister's latest paper that the list figure is 11,000, and only 5 per cent of practices have such lists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For accuracy's sake, the Government put out proposals the other day for GPs who are interested in becoming fund holders. We have changed the limit to between 9,000 and 11,000, which would take the figure to more than 5 per cent. I think that it would be more than 10 per cent. Of course, general practices may group together, as they have done in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). That creates the potential for many more practices than the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting remark. The Minister is right to say that group practices will be possible in say, a small town in Scotland of around 20,000 inhabitants, but one would create a monopoly in such an area. There will not be more competition whereby patients choose which practice to attend. If what the Minister has said is true for the constituency of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), there will be monopolies in some areas, unless patients are willing to travel 30 or 40 miles.</span></p>
<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) agree that, apart from there being a potential problem of monopolies, it seems from the Minister's intervention that this is a face-saving political formula to find a way to gear the system up so that the scheme can be held as a success or at least likely to function in constituencies such as Tayside, North? It has more to do with trust than with the realities of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is kind of the hon. Gentleman to give way again. It is the object of Committee work to hear the arguments of both sides. The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense. The people who are serviced by GPs in the Forfar area can equally go to Kirriemuir or other small places nearby because they cover a large rural area, as well as Forfar. There will be a choice.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0665">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the area that well, but I should object if I had to go from Hamilton to Motherwell to go on a GP's list because I did not want to be a part of the monopoly in my own town. That could happen.<br><br>
What does it mean for GPs? The Government say that the service will be run more efficiently. If there is no cash limiting it is difficult to see how financial restrictions will force GPs to work more efficiently. Where will the expertise come from, even in a practice of five GPs? My excellent local practice has five GPs. It never uses a deputising service. One of the doctors from that practice visits whatever time a doctor is called out. They deliberately restrict their income—and it will be even more restricted under the Bill—by restricting their lists to what they as doctors think that they can manage for the good of the practices. If a doctor visits someone at night, the same doctor will visit the following morning to check whether the patient is all right. For a parent with young children it is a worthwhile security to know that the GP will be back.<br><br>
That sort of practice is fine. It has health visitors, nurses, everything that a good practice should have, but the doctors would not pretend that they have the managerial skills or the time to give to the extra administrative burdens that will be placed upon them. They are busy men. In that practice, they start at eight in the morning doing visits before their surgeries. They carry on until six in the evening, and two of them are on call all night. When will they find time for the administration that the Minister appears to be placing on them? Of course, the Minister will say that there is a choice, and that they do not have to do it. That is true, but whatever practice does it, the GPs will have to find time for administration. The Government document states that doctors will be able to bring in experts from outside. That means that they will have to pay a fee. It is true that money will be paid towards the cost of budget management, but GPs will not have the time or energy to put into administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that, as the hon. Gentleman comes from a privileged background, he has hardly used the NHS. I shall enlighten him therefore, about small practices in rural areas. There are ladies, who deal with the bookings, paperwork and files. A budget will be provided to augment that facility, and the doctors will continue to provide health care, which is what they are there to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. Gentleman to repeat his remarks outside the House, without his privileges. If he does, I shall sue him, because I have never used private medicine. My family and I regularly use the NHS. The practice that we use in Hamilton, an industrial town, has many unemployed and socially deprived people on its list, and I find the hon. Gentleman's remark offensive.<br><br>
The girls who make appointments and keep the records up to date cannot deal with budgets of £600,000 or £700,000, and probably would not want to.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They deal with confidential information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they also deal with confidential information.<br><br>
Will practices have to save money and reduce some services in order, to use the Minister's words, to expand other services that they want to provide? How can they be more efficient and spend less money? We have said before that the Secretary of State and the Government correlate the word "cheapness" with "efficiency". They have the same meaning for the Government. When the Government talk about a practice being more efficient, they mean cheaper to run. How will practices economise? They could spread costs by accepting mostly patients who are unlikely to cause problems, such as young couples without children, who need little treatment and few drugs. They could cut the number of their patients by getting rid of those with long-term illnesses who cost much money. They could cut the remainder of their costs—I am not sure what they are or how they could be cut—or they could cut the number of drugs that they prescribe. The Government believe that many GPs overprescribe drugs, and give them out willy-nilly. That may be true of a few GPs, but not of most.<br><br>
Why should practices save money? If they are not cash limited, why should they bother. If they are cash limited, what will the Government allow them to do with any money that they might save?<br><br>
In reply to an earlier question of mine, the Minister for Health said that a £100,000 underspend would be used to expand services. What if a practice already has all the services that it can cope with? For instance, the building that houses the practice that I use could not accommodate, say an X-ray unit, and to build brand new premises elsewhere would cost much more than £100,000. The practice already has most of the services that its manpower and skills enable it to provide. If such a practice does not want to expand, what will happen to the £100,000? Will the health board take back that money, or will it go into a fund, such as an athletes' retirement fund? What are the Government's exact intentions?<br><br>
There have been differences in the Minister's statements about the £5,000 cash limit on any one patient. In England and Wales that would appear to be the limit on a patients' hospital costs, but paragraph 24 of "Scottish Working Paper I" says that health boards
<br><blockquote><p>"will be required to keep reserves to cover the costs of an individual's treatment (including drugs) in excess of £5,000".</p></blockquote>
The Minister should explain that apparent difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is looking at one of the working papers, but we have since published the document "Funding General Practice" which sets out the new position. It has been sent to all GPs, has been generally released and its press release has been widely reported. I apologise if the hon. Gentleman has not received a copy. It might have been sent to his hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). The document sets out the present position. The working
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0666">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
papers were designed to produce a response from the profession and others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. But the Minister did not explain the difference; I hope that he will do so later.<br><br>
I did not receive the document. It might have been sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), but that would have been remarkably insensitive of the Minister's advisers because my hon. Friend is not a member of the Committee and is in hospital recovering from a serious operation. It should have been sent to the Opposition's Front-Bench spokesman for Scotland on the Committee team.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is still the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman on health and he still conducts his constituency correspondence in the normal way. We would have sent a public document such as that to him as a matter of courtesy. If the hon. Member for Cathcart did not receive a copy he could have contacted the Department, as any hon. Member can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been courteous for the Minister to have ensured that I was sent a copy. Did the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) receive a copy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apparently not; nor has any Opposition Member. That is as we might expect.<br><br>
The Minister said that the Bill will allow GP fund holders to refer patients to hospitals other than the one normally attended by the patient. The GP will pay for that treatment out of his fund. If I were the patient and prepared to travel, I presume that I might be told, "You must have a hernia operation, Mr. Maxton. If you want to go to the Western infirmary you will have to wait three months, but if you are prepared to go to the Edinburgh Royal infirmary you may have the operation done next week".<br><br>
9.45 p.m.<br><br>
Such a matter does not require the complicated process involved in setting up the fund. All that is required is information and a GP can furnish that at present. He could tell me, "This is your problem. If you are prepared to wait three months you may go to hospital X but if you want the operation to be performed in a place which does not have the same high medical reputation you may to hospital Y." Such a choice was offered to me when I had a vasectomy—under the National Health Service, I hasten to inform the hon. Member for Tayside, North. I had the choice of waiting several weeks or months to go to a Glasgow hospital or of going to Stonehouse hospital within a matter of days.<br><br>
That choice has always been available, but the Minister is, at last, prepared to do something about what was lacking. A previous Health Minister, John MacKay, flatly refused to computerise or to spend money to ensure that waiting lists for all hospitals in Scotland could be made readily available to any GP so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
that he could rationally discuss waiting times with any of his patients merely by tapping into a computer. That is what should have been established, but for a long time the Government refused to do anything about it, so I am glad that the Minister is now prepared to act.<br><br>
GPs must be worried about prescribing for those patients who would require practices to have enormous budgets because of the cost of one prescription for them. Earlier, I cited the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). Murry Elder, who is the secretary of the Scottish Labour party, has had a heart transplant and my hon. Friend had a lung transplant and it so happened that both had the same GP. Each of their bills for drugs, apart from any other costs incurred, has been £10,000. GPs will be wary about taking on such patients because of the high costs that are involved, so we need assurances about costs from the Minister. In addition I do not believe that the proposed scheme offers any advantage to hospitals.<br><br>
I return to the point from which I began. If the Minister was right when he said that there will be no cash limiting of GPs' budget funds, why does he not accept the amendment? That would put at rest the unease felt by many people about the Government's proposals. They believe mat while there will be no cash limiting at the beginning of the scheme, it will not be long before it is introduced. They fear that patient care in Scotland will be sacrificed to the cause of the cheaper budgets that the Government want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not surprise the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) to hear that I cannot commend the amendments to the Committee. I am sorry if no one on the Conservative Benches helped the hon. Gentleman with research as to what was the Government's policy, but I am surprised that the GPs in his constituency and the BMA have not told him of the general excitement that exists among some GPs about the opportunities which fund holding presents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: More than the Department is prepared to deal with at present. It has had to pull down the shutters because it is unable to cope with the demand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, rightly, as the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said earlier, established some trial runs in Scotland. He is now saying that he has started a process of negotiation with GP practices. If he can do that now, why is the Bill necessary? If the law does not yet permit him to do it, why is he doing something for which he does not have the power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been urging the Government to listen to what the BMA and others say. Those concerned say that it would be helpful to see the concept tried out. As a helpful, reasonable, responsible Minister I have tried to accommodate them in every possible way. I have visited some practices and also received representations from my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). In a practice that I visited in Peterhead I found doctors who could answer the question that the hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0667">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
asked me—what is in it for doctors? They said that they would like the flexibility to decide within the practice how resources should be allocated and to choose the range of services available to their patients. The fact that decisions about which services to offer, how they should be provided and which bits of equipment to buy would be taken among themselves would mean that those decisions would reflect the needs of the people on their list far more effectively than if they were taken above their heads at health board level, or—even worse—by me and by the people in my Department. That is a reasonable point of view. It sounds like an argument for devolution, with which the hon. Gentleman claims to have sympathy. More general practitioners than The Department can at present support are keen to get on with the scheme ahead of the legislation. Until the Bill is enacted they will not be able to become fund holders, but they can put in place the technology and information systems that will be required. In Peterhead I also met the representatives of the patients association, and they were delighted by the prospects offered. Many general practitioners recognise the potential benefits. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health has said that several hundred have come forward in England, too.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart asked me what was in the scheme for the Government. Why, he asked, are the Government keen on the scheme if they are also keen on public expenditure cuts? The hon. Gentleman must be thinking back to the days when his party was in Government. The Labour Government were the only Government to cut expenditure on the Health Service—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the history of the Health Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. And as the Labour party will never be in Government again no future Government will cut expenditure on the Health Service in real terms. The hon. Member for Cathcart must know that the present Government have increased expenditure on the Health Service in Scotland by one third in real terms, and have ensured value for money, too. That is why 750,000 more patients are now being treated in the Health Service in Scotland every year than were treated in 1979.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart asks what is in the new scheme for the Government. He is right when he says that we want to reduce public expenditure as a proportion of GDP. Nevertheless, we have been prepared to devote resources to the Health Service. As we have had a growing economy we have been able to fund the service and meet our objectives for it. What is in the scheme for the Government is quality of care and value for money. If general practitioners can specify the quality of the service, that will be to the advantage of patients and also in line with the Government's policy.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman says that efficiency is about cheapness. It is not. Efficiency is about quality, cost and value for money. The cheapest is not always the best, but, with public sector unions and restrictive practices, neither is the most expensive always the best. We believe that fund holding, which will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
entirely voluntary, will provide an opportunity for more choice for patients and a better quality of service.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman claimed, too, that only 5 per cent of practices would be eligible. In fact 9,000 to 11,000 is rather more than 10 per cent and grouping practices together will make more eligible. There are examples of that in the pilot schemes that I have mentioned. The hon. Gentleman then changed his ground and argued that such groupings would create monopolies. If practices club together for budgeting purposes, as they do now within health boards, that does not mean that they are not separate practices competing with one another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that when the Minister said health boards he meant health centres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I meant health boards. Practices are looked after and their funding controlled within health boards. In England the equivalent organisation is at present known as a family practitioner committee. In Scotland a health board is responsible for a group of practices in its area. Under the Bill, smaller practices will be able to group together to become budget holders, but they will still operate as independent practices with their own partners and so on. They will still be in competition. To describe that as a monopoly is to argue that every GP practice in every health board is a monopoly, which is absurd. I am sure that when he has considered the matter the hon. Gentleman will wish to withdraw that criticism.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart asked where the expertise to run the budgets would come from. I regret that he has not had the chance to study the document, "Funding General Practice", but I am sure that when general practitioners have read it they will enthusiastically complete the form and send it to the Department. The document spells out how the scheme will work. Our press conference the other day was widely reported. We made an announcement, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State told the Committee this morning that general practitioners will be able to claim £32,000—£16,000 in the first half year—to cover administrative costs. They could buy in expertise, or perhaps employ a practice manager.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart cited the example of a splendid doctor in his constituency—I know that there are many splendid doctors in Scotland. The doctor that he mentioned was his own general practitioner—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, within the NHS. The hon. Gentleman's doctor apparently provides an excellent service, partly, no doubt, as a result of the 25 per cent extra that we now spend on the NHS in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if that doctor saved £100,000—it is interesting that he considers that there may be potential savings of that order—and had nothing to spend it on. If the hon. Gentleman knows general practitioners who say that they are so well funded that if they had £100,000 they could not think of anything to spend it on, perhaps we are beginning to achieve the sort of Health Service that the White Paper aimed to bring about. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that if a practice
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0668">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 595</span>
accumulated savings over more than four years it would no longer be able to retain them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that there was already a choice of hospitals, as he found out when he went for his vasectomy operation. But whatever choice the general practitioner made the funds did not follow the patient to the unit that provided the service. General practitioners who can manage budgets and make purchasing decisions will be able to demand the quality of service that they require. Their demands will count because cash will follow their decisions. If his doctor had been a purchaser in the market place, a consumer able to demand quality of service, the hon. Gentleman would have had an even better deal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How would I have had a better deal if the health board had given me a pack of money with which to walk into the hospital and say, "Here you are. I am paying for my vasectomy."?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do they do microsurgery in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman thinks that he is funny but he is not.<br><br>
I do not see what difference the money would have made. The operation was paid for one way or another. It does not matter to me as a patient whether the money follows me or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the operation is paid for one way or another, but in fact the money comes to the health board two years down the line. He told us that he had a choice of hospitals, and had he chosen one outside his area his general practitioner, as a purchaser, could have demanded quality of service as the money would have followed the patient. The hon. Gentleman's treatment may have been splendid in any case—we can discuss that later.<br><br>
The amendments are based on a misunderstanding, so I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Cathcart sufficiently for him to withdraw amendment No. 528.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After that offer, I am not sure that I can go ahead with the amendment. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall ignore that remark.<br><br>
I wanted to raise certain issues, but as I am conscious that there is about to be a Division in the House, it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I withdraw the amendment and return to the issues in later debates. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 516, in page 32, line 7, after "unless", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"it is satisfied that the combined list size, facilities and geographical are appropriate and".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 517, in page 32, line 10, at end insert—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 596</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"() The Health Board shall not recognise any practice as fund holding unless it is satisfied that the practice has the necessary staff and access to information to operate as a fund holder.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite a few of the points arising from the two amendments emerged in the enlightened and indeed stimulating exchanges which took place between the Minister and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) shortly before the break. Briefly, I wish to ask the Minister about some aspects of fund-holding practices which are causing concern, especially in the Scottish context.<br><br>
There is a stronger feeling in Scotland than in parts of England that some aspects of the Bill and this specific clause are inappropriate to Scottish circumstances for reasons of scales of geography and list sizes when compared with the situation south of the border. To what extent are we up and running in Scotland in terms of computer facilities at GP level, and how does the Minister see that development taking shape over the next 12 months? His ministerial colleague replied earlier to some similar questions on the situation in England and Wales, and it would be useful to Scottish Members to be brought up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust the hon. Gentleman will not confuse the Committee with his argument on whether or not the clause is relevant to Scotland. The proof of any pudding is in the eating, and no one is forcing anyone to do anything. The doctors in Scotland who have volunteered to move into the arena created by the clause have done so because they see advantages in it. They are Scotsmen working in Scottish practices; they are not on the moon. The hon. Gentleman's point is not relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the activity going on in the background is not a reflection on either the hon. Gentleman's intervention or my amendment. Conservative Back Benchers seem to be trying to bring down the shutters on both of us. We do not intend to delay them that long with our arguments about what is happening north of the border.<br><br>
In reply to the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) let me say that I adhere to the view that one reason for GPs having expressed such interest—as was revealed in exchanges with the Secretary of State earlier—is that in the overall context of the Bill the best way for the GPs to maintain control over their patients and their freedom to refer, and to avoid the contractual pressures introduced under other clauses, is to choose the status of fund-holding practice. I realise that the hon. Member for Tayside, North does not agree, but I contend that it is not the magnetic attraction of fund-holding practice status that is having that effect. It is simply that it is the less unpalatable route to follow if GPs want to continue to enjoy the status that hitherto they have enjoyed in the National Health Service.<br><br>
That may be a debatable point, but it is a fair one. The hon. Gentleman also spoke of the relevance of the system to Scotland. We have debated self-governing trusts for hospitals in Scotland but not many Scottish hospitals have so far expressed an interest, and that suggests that it is not always satisfactory to bring forward national legislation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0669">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 597</span>
I use that example as a comparison with the point that I am making about GP practices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recollect that similar arguments were advanced when the Government brought forward other permissive legislation—legislation that comes into effect only if people volunteer to participate. The same arguments were made from Opposition Benches about the sale of council houses but look how wrong Opposition Members were then.<br><br>
Individuals, and groups of individuals, must be willing to volunteer, as in the hon. Gentleman's example, to acquire self-governing hospital status. I was interested to note that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) does not appear to know where Stracathro hospital is. Geography is important when one is discussing Scotland; the bulk of Scotland is not at all like Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this historic juncture in our proceedings I am willing to give way to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) who may wish to make a geographical point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman remember the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) ever asking me that question? I may be going slightly deaf in my old age, but I cannot remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remember some exchanges along those lines, but I will not tread too far down that path. Both hon. Members have made their points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone) rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another hon. Gentleman is just about to surprise us with his knowledge of the geography of Scotland; I am happy to give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am thinking of the analogy with the sale of council houses suggested by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). It is exactly the same as the temptation offered by this new type of practice. It is fine for those who are in the system, but those who are left behind suffer for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; I cannot go too far down the road with him, as I have always considered the sale of council houses a good policy. I shall not stray from the amendment, Dame Janet, except to say that I disagreed strongly with certain aspects of the application of that policy, and at the time moved amendments to the legislation but I thought that the principle of selling council houses was right. There is a difference in principle here: when an individual decides to buy his council house, he is exercising an influence over his own life, but under this Bill, the decision to grant approval will be made by a small group of people who are not directly accountable to any electorate—members of health boards or officials in the Scottish Office. That makes this scheme philosophically different from the sale of council houses. The Government keep saying that they are concerned about the individual—the patient—but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 598</span>
the patient will not be given the opportunity at GP practice or hospital level to exercise his discretion or ability.<br><br>
I return to the amendments. Amendment No. 516 is probably unacceptable as drafted. The word "geographical" should be "geography". I hope that the Minister will consider the contrast between list sizes and geography in England and list sizes and geography in Scotland, whose terrain I have mentioned before. We need more reassurances about fund-holding practices and their community relevance to the areas in which they established—if that prospect can be faced with any sanguineness at all. I foresee geographical problems such as those that we mentioned earlier and the possible setting up of monopolies, which will not be in the interests of patients.<br><br>
I now wish to deal with information technology and computerisation. Are general practices in Scotland adequately computerised to take advantage of the circumstances that will result from the Bill? Clearly, for referral purposes, the GP level cannot be divorced from the hospital level, as GPs will need computerisation to assist them in providing recall and screening facilities. But I envisage a greater problem than that: how can the hospital sector play its part under the Bill if it is not fully computerised?<br><br>
The Select Committee on Social Services made some costings when it considered the White Paper. If the hospital sector is to be equipped to take proper advantage of the legislation, the cost will be staggering. I wonder whether the Scottish Home and Health Department, as a result of its budgetary priorities and practical scrutiny of the proposals, is sufficiently attuned to the investment that must take place to make the Bill workable and effective. Any information that the Minister can give about that would be helpful, especially to hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Tayside, North said, we are discussing permissive legislation. That means that much of the detail will be specified at a later date by orders, instruments, circulars from the Department of Health and so on. That is the cause of the anxiety and apprehension to which I have frequently referred. The bold words printed on the page raise legitimate inquiries to which both those who might be sympathetic to what has been decided and those of us who instinctively feel hostile towards it demand reasonable answers.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will give us more information about the important Scottish considerations of list size contrast, the problems of geography, the extent and scale of computer technology and the establishment of a proper computer base at both GP and hospital level. That, at least, would add to our knowledge even if it could not persuade us, politically, of the worth of the measure that he is defending.</span></p>
<p>10.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) made a helpful contribution and raised a number of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
reasonable—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why did not the Minister say that about my speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth/</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I always try to give the Committee a fair reflection of the circumstances as I perceive them. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) was seeking something else when he moved the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the political shadow that the Minister casts in Scotland, the hon. Member for Cathcart should be delighted because that comment will have done far more political damage to me than anything that the Minister could say to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without straying too far out of order, and knowing both the profile of the constituency of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye and the profile that he takes in it, I venture to suggest that being praised by a Conservative Minister will not damage his reputation in his constituency although it may damage his reputation in his party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the first time, there is agreement between the Minister and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used the amendments to probe and he raised a number of important points. He asked for an assurance that before GPs are allowed to become fund holders the Department and the health board must be satisfied that the practices had the necessary experience and systems in place and that arrangements for groupings of practice were appropriate. It would be ridiculous to write that into the Bill and the hon. Gentleman will see that the clause provides for regulations to be made to deal with the matter. Certainly, I assure him that we shall take account of the need to ensure that proper provision is made in the regulations with regard to facilities, location and so on.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye asked about computer facilities. I believe that about 40 per cent of patients in Scotland are now covered by GPs who operate the G-PASS system. I shall not detain the Committee by recounting the history of some of the difficulties that that system has caused, but they have been tackled. I understand that the worries expressed by GPs have been allayed and that new programmes are being developed. It is expected that the necessary software packages will be completed by autumn for those fund holders. We have put additional resources into that and there has been reorganisation of the G-PASS committee.<br><br>
With regard to health boards, the hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that, while the criteria about which he is concerned will be spelt out in regulations, in a sense, the boards will be investing in the scheme and will want to be satisfied that the money that they provide will be wisely spent and allocated.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that GPs would opt to become fund holders if they wished to enjoy the same status as they have at present. I do not know whether he will elaborate on that, but I simply did not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
understand his argument. If GPs do not wish to become fund holders, they will remain as they are now: there will be no change in their position. I believe that one anxiety of some elements in the BMA is that those GPs who become fund holders will provide a better service to their patients and, as a result, the patients of those who are not fund holders may ask, "Why are you unable to provide such services?". That is an entirely reasonable attitude to take from the point of view of a conservative professional, but not if one is concerned about providing the best possible range of patient services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that many fund-holding practices will be large multi-practices such as those in Glasgow which, even in present circumstances, with restrictions imposed on them, are able to provide better services than some two-doctor practices, which cannot become fund-holding practices in any case. The smaller practices are limited and their patients may leave, but what can they do about it? They cannot become GP fund holders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree that all single-handed or small practices necessarily provide inferior services and there is nothing to prevent any of them including those in cities—grouping together.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) spoke about geography, I believe that he was concerned that some groupings would not make practical sense where there were great distances between practices. Obviously, health boards will need to take account of such factors when considering grouping proposals.<br><br>
The amendments would require health boards to be satisfied about size, facilities and location and that the practices had the necessary staff and information systems. Those matters will be provided for in regulations and there will be flexibility. If we find in the light of experience that it is possible for smaller practices with fewer than 9,000 to 11,000 patients to operate the scheme effectively, that will be considered. Initially, as one would expect of the Government, we are proceeding cautiously in the interests of patient care.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister began and ended his comments in a similar tongue-in-cheek fashion. At the end of his remarks he said that he was cautious and proceeding with care, and at the beginning he complimented me. Given that there will be regulations—opportunities to take further bites at the cherry—and as time is moving along, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 518, in page 32, leave out lines 25 to 34.<br><br>
Looking at the amendment, I cannot recall why I wanted lines 25 to 34 to be left out. Prudence is the better part of valour, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 1ll, in page 32, line 28, leave out "Practitioner" and insert "Health".—<i>[Mr. Nicholas Bennett.]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 530, in page 32, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"having due regard to factors such as the age composition of the practice list; proportions of chronically sick and disabled people on the practice list; the social and economic characteristics of the area".</p></blockquote>
This is an important amendment because, when assessing the budget, it is vital that the health board, presumably in negotiation with the practice, should look at the practice list and decide what the future should be. I am grateful to the Minister for handing me details of the latest options. Reading the documentation, it is not clear whether the budget given to the GP practice will necessarily be the same as it had prior to becoming a fund-holding practice. Obviously, it is a matter for negotiation.<br><br>
Hospital treatment patterns are an important factor. It is clear that health boards will consider whether the level of referrals is justified, given the average level of referrals and the particular circumstances of each practice. Health boards will consider the number of referrals to hospitals. The list of treatments that will be paid for by fund holding practices is considerably longer than it was in the earlier document to which I referred. I am not a doctor—the Minister may have an explanation of what the names mean. The list includes operations for valvular or ischaemic diseases of the heart, which are increasingly becoming unelective operations.<br><br>
That is why it is essential to examine the age composition of the practice list, the proportion of chronically sick and disabled and the social and economic characteristics of the area. For instance, Castlemilk, in my constituency, is one of the largest areas of deprivation in Scotland, with an unemployment rate of nearly 30 per cent. With the problems of dampness, low parental incomes, dietary and other problems that are part and parcel of such an area, doctors are more likely to refer patients to hospitals. An ill child from Castlemilk would be sent to hospital, but a child from a middle-class area would be told to stay at home.<br><br>
The health board could say that a doctor's referral rate was way out of line with the GP practice half a mile down the road, not taking account of the fact that one practice was in an area of multiple deprivation while the other was in an area of middle-class affluence. That is possible in my constituency. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is trying to prove that he knows something about my constituency.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 602</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have canvassed the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that. Now I know one reason why I won the seat and have a majority of 11,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the same spirit, I invite the hon. Gentleman to canvass in my constituency. That will help my majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can we stick to the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to explain that the difference between the hon. Gentleman's constituency and mine is that, 11 years ago, Cathcart was held by the Conservatives but is now held by Labour, while his constituency has never been held by Labour, and the Tory majority has slipped away over the years.<br><br>
I do not want to belabour the point, because I am sure that the Minister will say that I am right and that those factors must be taken into account. As I read the document, if the Glasgow health board is strapped for money—as it will be, over the coming two or three years—it may say, "Sorry, your referrals are too large. We shall not give you that size of budget, we shall cut it. In that way, we can save some of the money that we are being required to save by the Secretary of State."</span></p>
<p>10.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's concern, but does he agree that so much of the doctor's time will be spent negotiating with the health board and other agencies that he will have less time to spend on his patients and health care matters? That is something that the Government have not taken into consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. When a GP wishes to send a patient to hospital, the first thing that he has to do is to decide which hospital will offer the cheapest or most efficient service—it will depend on the state of the practice's fund at the time—or, to put it another way, the hospital that will offer the best service. Then he has to contact the hospital and negotiate with it. He will say, "Can you take my patient, and what will the cost be?" The hospital will need to be careful in negotiating with the GP fund holder because—as either this document or the other document says—if it makes a wrong diagnosis and has to do more tests or carry out a more expensive operation, it will have to bear the cost. The hospital will gain, of course, if it carries out fewer tests than it thought necessary or if it finds that it does not have to carry out an operation. Nevertheless, the price that the GP fund holder negotiates is fixed. So my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) is right to say that the process will take up much of the doctor's time. If I were a parent living in Castlemilk with a sick child who needed to be referred to hospital, I would not be very happy about the GP spending so much time negotiating about to which hospital to send the child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell my hon. Friend what happened to me. In 1983, when I went into hospital for an operation, I was there for three weeks,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0672">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 603</span>
and having come out, I had to be readmitted because there was some doubt as to whether I had been allowed home prematurely. Under the contract, the contracted period could be three weeks, and the GP could end up in dispute with the hospital about whether I should be readmitted on the second occasion. The hospital might argue, "He should stay at home", while the GP might retort, "He should go to hospital." Who would resolve the dispute? In any case, it would take a great deal of the doctor's time, and that happened in my case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to do the Minister's job for him, but I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is quite correct. A fixed price will be agreed. If such circumstances arise, the hospital will have to bear the cost, and if the hospital is an NHS trust it will be in trouble if such circumstances arise too often.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: General practitioners have been shopping around hospitals for years, particularly in relation to waiting lists. In future, GPs will be able to shop around in the usual way, but their choice, coupled with that of their patients, will be backed by cash. That has never happened before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that issue on a later amendment.<br><br>
At present, a GP shops around hospitals before deciding on the hospital for his patient, but that is entirely different from negotiating the price of the operation or treatment, and having to do that prior to the patient being admitted. A doctor telephones a hospital and says, "Can you take this young child; he has gastroenteritis and should be hospitalised as quickly as possible?" The ambulance is then called for and the child put in hospital immediately. Having agreed on the treatment and the doctor found to administer it, the GP should not then have to negotiate the charge.<br><br>
It is important that when the budget for the general practitioner fund-holders are worked out, these items are included. The hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, nods his head and we hope that he will include what we propose in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of the advice given to me by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) on the previous amendment, perhaps I should now praise the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). He spoke very sensibly. If the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) thinks that a thousand votes have been lost, perhaps I should offer that praise another ten times. The hon. Member for Cathcart is right in the sentiment contained in his amendment, but he argued the case against my accepting the amendment and writing the provisions he sought into the Bill. The amendment provides that the budget should be set,
<br><blockquote><p>"having due regard to factors such as the age composition of the practice list; proportions of chronically sick and disabled people on the practice list; the social and economic characteristics of the area."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Cathcart talked about past history in terms of hospital referrals and such matters.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 604</span>
The list that he has put in the amendment, if included in the Bill, would not take into account other factors.<br><br>
The Bill makes provision for matters to be determined by regulation rather than by primary legislation. I assure the hon. Member for Cathcart that by setting budgets or funds for the fund-holders, age, sex, composition of the practice list, previous hospital referral and prescribing patterns and the number of chronically sick and disabled people will be taken into account.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has powers to direct the board to take such factors into account in setting funds. One advantage of the shadow practices we have operating is that they will help us to gather the relevant information.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart has a fair point and I am happy to give him the assurances which he seeks on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not think we would get anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am agreeing with the hon. Gentleman. Where I take issue with him is on his contention that the effect of the amendment should be written into the Bill, and on his argument that the assurances we have given can be relied upon only if they are written into the Bill. Regulations will be laid, and no one could argue that any GP would wish to become a fund holder unless the funds that were made available to him took account of these factors.<br><br>
I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried by what the Minister has said. I am delighed that at this time of night none of the Scottish press is present to hear what he said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall tell the press about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman will tell it. It will make a good diary story. I notice the Minister did not pay much regard to social and economic characteristics. He said that hospital referrals also involved drug prescriptions. In an area such as Castlemilk, in my constituency, people suffer from depression and psychosomatic diseases, and doctors sometimes prescribe placebos for them. The placebos work because the patient believes that they do, which is usually half the battle. There are problems of both mental and physical ill-health in such areas that are created by depression and caused by unemployment. I hope that the Minister will assure us that those circumstances will be taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsysth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be genuine confusion here. If social and economic conditions result in more referrals to hospitals, in more prescribing, and in greater numbers of chronically sick and disabled people on lists that will be taken into account. The budget will be set on the basis of the expenditure that has been incurred in the past. It will reflect the nature of the area, assuming that it has not changed dramatically. I must admit that the Government are transforming Castlemilk.</span></p>

convinced of that yet.<br><br>
I accept the Minister's assurances, and we shall study the regulations carefully when they appear. I hope that we shall debate them at some stage, and that my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) will be fit and healthy by then and will take part in that debate.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 549, in page 33, line 51, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) No fund-holding practice shall receive any contributions from patients, to the cost of any treatment that would not have been paid in any practice that was not a fund-holding practice".</p></blockquote>
In the amendment I seek to ensure that fund holders cannot charge patients for treatment that they would have obtained free from any other NHS GP. For instance, a GP Fund holder could say to a patient in need of an operation, "Look, I can get your operation in one hospital for £X, or in a teaching hospital with a great surgeon. However, it will cost my fund £X in the first hospital, and £100 more in the second. I shall pay the same to either hospital, but I shall ask you to pay the extra £100 if you want the operation in the second, so-called better, hospital." The amendment would ensure that that could not happen; although the Minister might say that he will prevent it by regulation.<br><br>
There are other facilities for which fund holders might charge. For instance, the Government are rightly encouraging GPs to make regular medical checks of women for various diseases, and to run well men clinics as they are now called, to check blood pressure regularly, for example. As far as I am aware, most GPs do not charge for those services, but there seems to be nothing in the Bill which provides that GP fund holders cannot charge for them. I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that such charging will not occur.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the same arrangement is provided for in Scotland as it is in the rest of the United Kingdom. I understand that one of the working documents responded in part to the point which I am about to make.<br><br>
A consultant who works in an opted-out NHS hospital and also in a private sector hospital may say to a GP or a fund holder, "I can do the operation in private time under my NHS contract, quite legitimately
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 606</span>
and within the rules, but I cannot do it in NHS time". The fund-holding GP may then say to his patient, "We have two options. You can go either to the general hopsital or to the private hospital, but if you go to the private hospital, to get earlier treatment, I want some additional payment to my practice for giving you this access." Is there not a danger of that happening, and is it not true that the working documents, which deal in part with that possibility, are insufficient because they do not define what action the Government will take to stop that happening? I think that a GP may say that in return for a sum of money, he might well be willing to refer a patient to a private hospital, to be treated by the same consultant who does not have time available, and has a waiting list, in the NHS hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on to a fair point. He may not have seen paragraph 29 of Scottish Working Paper 1 on topping up, and it may be helpful if I read it out. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The existing distinction between NHS and private patients will be maintained under the practice budget scheme. Where GPs refer patients for non-NHS treatment, no payments will fall to the practice budget. While GP practice budget holders will be able to refer NHS patients to private hospitals for NHS treatment, patients seeking NHS treatment will not be permitted to top-up the practice budget in order to secure treatment. The full cost of relevant NHS treatments must be met out of the GP practice budget. Under the current terms and conditions of service, GPs are not permitted to receive payment from NHS patients in respect of NHS treatment provided. The Government will discuss with the profession and Health Boards the necessary amendments to existing terms of service to make topping-up a breach of their terms of service."</p></blockquote>
I have to tell my hon. Friends that this may be a unique occasion in this Committee when I find myself in complete agreement with the hon. Members for Cathcart and for Workington in arguing that the regulations should be drafted in such a way as to ensure that topping up of the sort which has been described should not be possible. We do not want patients to have to pay charges merely because there may be better treatment available from a fund-holding practice, nor do we want patients to be able to opt for private treatment by topping up the amount which their GP would otherwise have contributed from his budget. I can assure the hon. Member for Workington that while I cannot accept his amendment, we shall ensure that our powers by regulation under section 87A(3)(c) will achieve the purpose spelled out in the Scottish working paper.<br><br>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) because I am not familiar with what the English working document said. The Scottish paragraph that I quoted could not be clearer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that rules will be introduced by regulation to prevent topping-up procedures. Will the Minister clarify the position? Are there not existing rules that relate to the prescribing of drugs by GPs? I believe that breaches of those rules by GPs have been reported to the Scottish Home and Health Department. They have been exposed in the media. That suggests that GPs may be willing to take the risk and breach the rules because the penalties are insufficient. Will the penalties provided by the regulations be a major disincentive to GPs to breach
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0674">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 607</span>
the rules?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any general breach of the rules in Scotland. We are discussing what the rules should be. The law will always be breached from time to time, but we seek to ensure that the rules clearly prohibit conduct of that kind. Except in defined cases, GPs in Scotland are already prohibited from charging patients by the regulations that apply to their terms and conditions of service.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart was worried because GPs can refer patients to private hospitals or to consultants operating in the private sector on a part-time basis. He was worried too, that fund-holding practices may be attractive to patients and that doctors may be able to levy charges in addition to those received on their patients' behalf from the health board. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that that would be unacceptable, and I assure him that we would use the regulatory power under section 87A.(3)(c) to achieve our purpose. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that the topping-up control arrangement will work. I foresee circumstances in which a patient may say to the fund-holding practitioner, "Look, why am I waiting for my operation? A bed is available in that private hospital and you could secure an operation for me. But you are telling me that I must wait for one or two months for an operation in a hospital with which you have a contract. My hip operation could be performed tomorrow by the same consultant. He has time to do the operation in a private hospital and under his contract he may do so." Is the Minister saying that in such circumstances financial considerations would not be on the agenda? What will happen if the patient tells the GP that he wants the operation tomorrow and he knows that it is available? The patient may say, "The legislation states that it is within your power to direct that my operation takes place in a private hospital. The Government are allocating you money but I am willing to pay something towards my operation if it will cost you more." All sorts of means may be found to ensure that that money is allocated to the practice. Such procedures would be hard to outlaw.<br><br>
The Minister said that no breaches of the rules have been reported, to him, but several articles in English newspapers over the years have reported that GPs have been offered inducements, such as equipment for their surgeries, in return for prescribing certain drugs. I assumed that that was in breach of Department of Health regulations, but perhaps, in my ignorance, I was wrong. If I am right, there is a history of the rules being breached by some GPs. They seem to have found a way round the rules and I am damned sure that they will find a way round the regulation in spite of the Government's topping-up control mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister knows of my interest in GPs who comply with their contracts of service and in those who do not. In life, there are always people who will not obey the rules, but that does not mean that rules should not be made. The House of Commons has a splendid system and the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 608</span>
Savours) is a perfect example of people who regularly break the rules to get their own way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, my future approach in Committee should be to reject amendments out of hand. I should not agree to embody the spirit of amendments in regulations. The hon. Member for Workington has a perspective on the world that sees the worst in everything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is not right to suggest that GPs would look for ways in which to break the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that they would. I said that that may happen in certain cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that it may happen in certain cases. Some doctors may break the law but the position will be clear: the practice that we are discussing will be illegal. Since 1974, in Scotland the National Health Service—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a sub-conversation going on at the back of the Committee Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The National Health Service (General Medical and Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1974, schedule 1, paragraph 20 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A doctor shall not demand or accept any fee, remuneration or charge, other than payments due to him under the regulations, or any charge payable in accordance with the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 1980, in respect of any treatment rendered or any drug or appliance supplied, whether under these terms of service or not, to a patient of his or of his partner or assistant."</p></blockquote>
There is a procedure that the hon. Gentleman can follow if he knows of any GP who is in breach of the regulations. It is not a matter for the Committee. I have given an undertaking to the hon. Gentleman and that is as far as I can go.<br><br>
There are exceptions, such as charging a school or an employer for the medical examination of a patient, charging a nursing home that does not provide medical services under the NHS and charging a patient for a circumcision which is required on religious rather than medical grounds. They are not relevant to fund holders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not troubling my hon. Friends who wish to disappear by going on at length. I do not look everywhere for conspiracies to defraud. Legislation should be framed to ensure that such abuses will not arise, because when they are reported, they create public suspicion of the administrative department in which the abuse occurred. It is Parliament's job to ensure that legislation is drafted to avoid unreasonable public suspicion. If it is not possible to formulate legislation in that way, it should not be proposed. I have examined the Bill and I believe that there is a greater potential for abuse in this proposal than the Minister believes. His faith in the market is so unrelenting that he is not prepared to accept that the allegations may be true and that my anxieties may be realised. When I raised the subject of consultants' contracts in Parliament in 1985, 1986 and 1987, everyone said, "No, it is not possible.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0675">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 609</span>
There is no abuse." I went to the Public Accounts Committee, I raised the matter on the Floor of the House, persisted at the Public Accounts Committee and, lo and behold, we suddenly get a National Audit Office report identifying the problem and a <i>Sunday Times</i> article last week setting it out in great detail.<br><br>
Journalists found the abuses and the BMA admitted to them yet hon. Members refuse to accept that they exist. They say that it is a small problem. The Minister should study the questions asked of Mr. Nichol by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) at the Public Accounts Committee one-and-a-half weeks ago. The questions were based on internal documents, provided by one of the Birmingham health authorities, which set out the scale on which the abuse was taking place. I am not prepared to accept legislation that will allow that to happen again. Conservative Members may be. It is our duty to examine the abuses and draw up legislation to prevent them taking place.</span></p>
<p>11.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to scrutinise such matters, and I hope that he will accept our undertaking. Although I have no responsibility in Birmingham, I shall examine the service regulations and the complaints about them, and write to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
We do not wish to blur the difference between the private sector and the NHS. A patient who goes to a GP will have a clear choice: he can go either as a private or an NHS patient. The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Cathcart is designed to outlaw payment from patients to GPs. Payment will not be allowed. If it happens, the GP will be in breach of the law and the relevant action will be taken. If the hon.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
Member for Workington has evidence of abuses by GPs in Scotland, I should like to examine it. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North has asked me questions about that.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Member for Cathcart that I am doing everything that he wants bar accepting his amendment. It reminds me of the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Act 1989. I tried to accept an amendment to it but the Committee was divided on the matter. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's assurances. We cannot legislate to ensure that everybody obeys the law all the time. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is right in one sense: we are always in danger of passing laws that we cannot enforce. I do not say that we should not have speeding laws, but I do not think that there are many people in this Room who have never driven at more than 30 mph in a built-up area. That law is not enforced. We should be wary about passing laws that we cannot enforce. I accept the Minister's assurances in the generous manner in which he made them and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
