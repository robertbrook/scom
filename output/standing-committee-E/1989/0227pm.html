NHS CONTRACTS (COMPENSATION)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>'It shall be a condition of National Health Service contracts provided for in section 4 of this Act that any patient who suffers medical damage as a result of a medical accident shall be entitled to compensation without need to prove negligence.'.—<i>[Ms. Harman.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
Every year, the NHS treats millions of patients, most of whom are satisfied with their treatment and care. But mistakes can and do happen. No organisation or group of professionals is immune from making mistakes. When things go wrong in health care, the consequences can be very serious. Mistakes can mean discomfort, disability— sometimes profound disability—and death. When things go wrong, compensation should be paid, and paid promptly. But that does not happen in the present system, which is a cruel lottery. Most people receive no compensation, and those who do often have to endure court battles and years of delay.<br><br>
The problem was highlighted recently by the case of haemophiliacs who had contracted the HIV virus through contaminated blood products. They were made an exception to the current unjust system. The Government recognised that they were an exception not because their problem was exceptional—thousands of people every year suffer the injustice of the compensation system—but because over 1,000 of them suffered from the same condition: the NHS had inflicted the same damage on all of them. They formed a group and started a public campaign which led to their being made an exception. We pressed the Government to make an exception and warmly applauded the fact that compensation was awarded. But the injustice suffered by thousands of other people remains. The fact that haemophiliacs were made an exception points to the further injustice suffered by people who are not haemophiliacs who contracted the HIV virus through contaminated blood products.<br><br>
A woman in the west midlands contracted the HIV virus from a blood transfusion after she had a baby. She did not get any compensation. A constituent—not a haemophiliac—of my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) contracted the HIV virus through contaminated blood products in the NHS and was not awarded compensation under the scheme.<br><br>
Despite the fact that an exception was made for haemophiliacs, the injustice remains for thousands of other people. The only difference is that they do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1304</span>
necessarily share the same condition, neither have they all been victims of the same medical accident. That does not necessarily mean that their needs are less. There is a strong case for reform of the compensation system and the Government should accept the thrust of the new clause.<br><br>
The case for reform is based on a number of arguments. There is the hurdle of having to prove negligence before getting compensation. That excludes many people who might have a case from getting compensation. It is difficult to prove that a doctor has been negligent. Doctors themselves cannot be sure that the unforeseen outcome or accident to their patient is the result of negligence or just something that happens from time to time. Doctors recognise the unfairness of the system. They often want their patients to be compensated but having to prove negligence has two consequences. First, it means that doctors always defend cases because their professional reputation hangs on the negligence claim. Secondly, the insurance companies make doctors fight claims even if they are not keen to do so. Having to prove negligence is too high a hurdle to jump.<br><br>
Access to the courts is too difficult. Legal aid eligibility limits have been systematically eroded, so fewer people are entitled to legal aid. Many people who might be able to prove negligence and who might have a good case, even under the current system, do not get to court because they do not qualify for legal aid; nor do they have enough money to finance a court action.<br><br>
There is a risk for people who have the resources to finance a court action but who are not eligible for legal aid. Just when their need for resources is at its greatest, because of the disability or problem caused by the medical accident, they are asked to risk thousands, often hundreds of thousands, of pounds in court fees to prove their claim for negligence before any payment is made. I remind the Committee that people who do not qualify for legal aid have to pay their own legal costs—in my opinion, the fees charged by solicitors and barristers for litigation is scandalous—and run the risk of paying the full legal costs of the health authority and the doctor. The very time when their need for resources is at its greatest is the time when they have to take a huge financial gamble.<br><br>
I recall a case in which the parents were considering suing in respect of a child who had suffered brain damage as a result of a medical accident. They said, "Do we spend our money on legal fees and risk a second mortgage on our house, or even losing our house, to pay for the court case to get our son his rights? Or do we use the money for the extra services that he now needs?" It is a terrible gamble.<br><br>
The third argument in our case for reform concerns court delays. Even if people are eligible for legal aid, or if they are prepared to risk hundreds of thousands of pounds to go to court, they do not necessarily get the money when they need it; they may get it many years later. The delays in court procedures are scandalous. Delays of 10 or 11 years are not unusual before people are paid the compensation to which they are entitled.<br><br>
I shall give a couple of examples. In one case, a girl of 10, whose brain was damaged in a mistake by hospital doctors, was awarded damages of £1 million. Donna— that was her name—was severely brain-damaged at the age of two, after doctors wrongly diagnosed diabetes and administered insulin. She was awarded damages after eight years, and during that time the parents experienced the anxiety of taking litigation and had to provide for her needs without adequate resources. It was reported that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1305</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"a young girl was awarded £475,000 damages in the High Court yesterday for a hospital error which left her severely handicapped. Tanya Amos, aged 11, was brain damaged after suffering oxygen deprivation during her birth."</p></blockquote>
It took her 11 years to get the compensation to which she was entitled. Even if one can get access to the courts and prove negligence, the delays are unacceptable and an integral part of the compensation system.<br><br>
The compensation system is unjust and the cost is spiralling. As the courts are justifiably making high awards to victims of medical accidents, insurance costs are increasing. The figures that I have received in response to parliamentary questions show that the average cost of a hospital doctor's insurance was £135 in 1982. By 1989, it had increased to £1,350. We are getting the worst of all possible worlds. Health authorities, and thus the Government, have to pay enormous insurance bills, yet few victims get compensation, and then only after years of struggle through the courts.<br><br>
There is a consensus among the professions, the Patients Association and others, on the need for change. The King's Fund Institute report entitled "Medical Negligence", written by Dr. Chris Ham and published in 1988 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"First, the procedure is lengthy and expensive. Second, claimants often find it difficult to obtain the services of a solicitor with relevant expertise. Third, the legal process is adversarial and causes those involved to close ranks. Consequently, patients and relatives are often not given adequate explanation or apology when things go wrong, and doctors may be distressed by the apparent hostility of patients".</p></blockquote>
The Patients Association and the British Medical Association believe that the time has come to change the compensation system. David Bolt, who chaired the no-fault compensation working party of the British Medical Association, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The medical profession hates the present arrangements for pursuing medical negligence claims."</p></blockquote>
He is not satisfied with the situation, even for the patients who succeeded with their claims.<br><br>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"we feel very sad about the tiny minority of patients who have a real prospect of obtaining compensation through the courts … they have a long and very bitter struggle before them, and have to proceed on the basis that the individual who looked after them was careless in providing their care".</p></blockquote>
The Government's arguments against change come down to the assertion that it would cost too much. They can sustain that argument only if they know how much the current system costs and how much a new system would cost. It is clear from my parliamentary questions to successive Ministers for Health that the Government do not know the cost of the current system. The cost can be established only if one adds up all the in-court settlements, all the out-of-court settlements, the cost of the in-house RHA and DHA legal advice, the legal aid bills, the costs of people who paid their own solicitors and barristers, the cost in court time and the cost of the insurance bill. That is the cost of the current unfair system. The Government have first to establish the cost of the current system and then the cost of the new system. The cost of a no-fault compensation system would be as high as the tariffs that are laid down by the Government for paying out for various disabilities. The Government could have an expensive system if they paid huge awards to everybody, or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1306</span>
they could have a cheap system that paid out low awards. It does not wash to say that a new system would be too expensive, if there is nothing to compare it with.<br><br>
The current system should be replaced with a no-fault compensation scheme in which the victim of a medical accident would have to show damage and would be given compensation according to a tariff. Redress through the courts would have to remain as an ultimate safeguard, but for practical purposes it would be used only in rare cases that no-fault compensation schemes could not deal with.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
We should also improve professional disciplinary procedures. It is not clear whether the threat of a negligence action has any noticeable disciplinary effect on doctors. It is not clear from any studies whether a doctor's clinical decision is affected by his having to look over his shoulder and wonder whether he might end up in court. Some studies show that the fear of a negligence action affects the way in which a doctor practises, while other studies show that it does not necessarily do so. It is not easy to say that the current negligence-based adversarial system acts as a disciplinary safeguard. However, to give the benefit of the doubt, we should insist that a no-fault compensation system should have improved disciplinary procedures. It sometimes seems to us that doctors are found guilty of misconduct, or of any lapse of professional discipline, only if fraud or sex are involved. It is very rare for the GMC to discipline a doctor for failing to carry out his professional duties.<br><br>
We have tabled the new clause to get the Government to answer questions about cost. We shall not listen to the argument that it is too expensive unless they tell us how much the current system costs, and make a sophisticated analysis of the cost of an alternative system.<br><br>
We also want the Government to accept that there is a problem. We know that they have conceded that, because they have made an exception for haemophiliacs. The Government have responded to a public campaign on behalf of haemophiliacs who have contracted HIV through contaminated blood products. We ask the Government to respond also to all those people who are suffering just as greatly but were not covered by that campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was one of the hon. Members from both sides of the House who participated in the campaign for haemophiliacs. Many of us accepted in principle the need to ringfence that provision so that it would not be treated as a precedent for the wider and more serious—and in some respects more precedent-creating —arguments that the hon. Lady has developed. I make that point without prejudice to her arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might have been wise for haemophiliac HIV victims, as a tactical consideration, to say, "Treat us as an exception because we have a special case." But they still needed a public campaign because legal procedures could not compensate many of them. They could not always prove negligence—although I understand that some cases had been brought—and many of them died even before their case were launched, let alone brought to a successful conclusion. In those respects, the cases of victims of other medical accidents are not at all different.<br><br>
We want the Government to answer the question about costs, and to accept that there is a problem not only for haemophiliacs who have contracted AIDS but for all the other people who have not been part of a mass campaign.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1307</span>
We want the Government at least to express their intention to review the situation. The Pearson-commisson was a long time ago and the situation has changed. The cost of indemnity insurance alone has spiralled since then. The injustice remains. It is unacceptable for the Government to preside over something that is so unjust and also so expensive; it does not make sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I agree with the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) that compensation should be extended to non-haemophiliacs. There is little distinction morally and legally between those who come within the present scheme because they are haemophiliacs and others who have HIV as a result of a blood transfusion. We are speaking of about 50 people. Perhaps it should be argued that the ringfence was drawn in slightly the wrong place rather than argue for a totally different category of people. I hope that the Government will have second thoughts given the small numbers involved and the almost impossible task of drawing a distinction between haemophiliacs and non-haemophiliacs.<br><br>
Secondly, on the broader issue, I recall speaking in the Pearson debate and urging the then Labour Government to introduce a provision that would have had exactly the impact of the new clause. I am sad to say that my oratory fell on deaf ears. When in Government, the Labour party could have introduced such legislation, but did not do so. I understand that Labour party policy has since changed, although I do not condemn any party for having second thoughts. I speak as someone who supported the establishment of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents, the founder of which used to live in Acton. It is now run by Mr. Simanowitz, if I am correct. It is a worthwhile organisation and its aims deserve support.<br><br>
There are difficulties in proving medical negligence. I see some force in having a no-fault system, but with the Government or the DHA being able to take over the victim's rights to obtain compensation when it is considered that negligence has occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause is important. I wish to tell the Committee a story, one that hon. Members may well wish to hear, but do not wish to name the health authority involved.<br><br>
Some years ago I received an anonymous letter. I subsequently discovered that it came from a nurse who worked in a hospital ward. The letter detailed what had happened during a child's stay in hospital. The letter referred to consultants making every effort to hide what had happened. It drew attention to the attitude and views of nurses on the ward at the time. The letter also said that no one on the ward was prepared to talk about the incident because people were anxious about their employment and their relationship with others on the ward.<br><br>
The letter gave me one clue in that it named the child involved. I traced that child to a council house on an estate in the north of England. I visited the family and found a child who, by then, was totally mentally disabled. I do not use the term that is generally applied to children in that condition because it is distasteful. We all know the term that is invariably used. The family was in distress and I asked what had happened. I did not say that I had received an anonymous letter. The parents told me that they had taken their child to the hospital. In their own words, they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1308</span>
described what had happened. Their child had gone into hospital with a condition known as croup and had come out—and is to this day—severely mentally handicapped.<br><br>
Having interviewed the family, I told them that they should see a solicitor. They did so, but because of the relationships in that part of the country between members of the legal profession and the medical and many other professions that mix in the same social circumstances in the same places, the solicitor told the family that he was unable to bring an action. I told the family that I would arrange for London lawyers to represent them. On my return to Parliament some months later I approached a well known solicitor in London who had had experience of such cases to ask whether he would handle the case.<br><br>
That solicitor took on the case and for nearly two years argued with the hospital. The result was that unless the nurses on the ward—who had been identified, but not by name, in the anonymous letter to me—were prepared to surface and to make statements, it was not possible to bring a successful action in the courts. As a consequence, that family have not received one penny of compensation.<br><br>
I know that we all embroider our tales—<i>[Interruption.]</i> We do so in the sense that if we are trying to make a case, we might be inclined to over-emphasise certain aspects. But I tell this story in the most objective of ways. It is as I said, I retain the letter. The file remains with the solicitors in London and nothing has happened. In my view, the likelihood of a successful action being brought in that case is almost zero because the solicitor who represented the family and that child has told me that there is not much chance of a successful case being brought. What has happened is a grave and gross injustice.<br><br>
I understand arguments about public expenditure as well as anyone on the Conservative Benches, even Ministers. I should be worried about opening up a huge area of expenditure without perhaps placing a restriction on it. But there must be a way through. Perhaps the criteria could be strictly drawn or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) seemed to suggest, there could be capped expenditure with almost a two-tier system of compensation. In other words, a base level of compensation would be paid by the state and a person would have the option to proceed in a private action if he thought that he might win and receive more compensation by so doing. A base level of provision should be made and I shall tell the Committee why.<br><br>
When a child returns home in the circumstances that I described, a family incurs considerable additional expenditure. It might have to install special equipment. The parents might have to take their child away or attend to it; sometimes the parents must take holiday periods when otherwise they would not do so. Often equipment adaptations must be made to their home. In the case that I described, an extension had to be built to the family's house to provide a play area because the house was not large enough to meet the child's additional requirements.<br><br>
The state must accept some responsibility in such cases. In the 1990s, in this so-called decade of increasing affluence, the state must accept additional responsibilities. I accept that such expenditure should not get out of hand, but a base level provision should be made, within the most strict criteria. I hope that the Minister will not write off this matter.<br><br>
I am told that New Zealand has a no-fault system. If that is so, I should like to think that the Department and Ministers have consulted the New Zealand Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1309</span>
about whether the system has operated successfully, whether they have been able to cap expenditure in individual cases and to what extent they have been able to draw tight criteria for the provision of compensation. If they have a message from the application of that scheme which this Government could adopt to deal with the problem, surely we should consider that. I hope that the Minister offers some flexibility in his response to the debate.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter and it is right to consider it in the context of the Bill. It should be not a party matter but one to which all hon. Members should give reasonable priority.<br><br>
The present system to deal with these problems is grossly inadequate. Indeed, from January this year the health authorities have stood virtually alone with the responsibility for defending such actions. We recognise that the system has become absurd. The decision to put health authorities essentially in the front line of defence from January has brought the matter to a head and it must be resolved.<br><br>
The Haemophilia Society's case was dealt with in a different context only because blood transfusion is a regional service and the source of the plasma was a single national laboratory managed as a national service. Therefore, the legal responsibility did not lie with an individual health authority but, formally speaking, with the Secretary of State because it was a national service. That is what made the haemophilia problem different. That does not apply to a raft of other cases.<br><br>
In the absence of a no-fault compensation scheme there is a rising trend for people—even quite poor people and those whose resources are stretched beyond all reasonable breaking points—to sustain legal action to secure a result, no matter what it costs or how long it takes. Over the past five years, there has been a range of cases in which results and compensation were ultimately achieved, no matter how long that took and irrespective of suffering or the investment of material, finances and mental resources. There is a steadily rising trend of court settlements in favour of the victims of such accidents.<br><br>
Under the present system, especially after January this year when the health authorities were left standing alone, responsibility falls upon individual health authorities. It is an extraordinary system. It is even more extraordinary that there is no centralised system of sharing the financial impact of judgments and settlements across health authorities. It is absurd that an individual health authority, which may be quite small, is suddenly faced with a substantial settlement for a medical accident case which was brought against it. That could make a considerable difference to the authority's funding.<br><br>
The Newcastle district health authority had two such cases settled against it. After many years of legal action they finally came to fruition. Both involved substantial settlements.<br><br>
That is not the way to deal with such matters. In those circumstances the health authority is, of necessity, obliged to sustain whatever defence there may be for as long as possible, even if it does not really want to, because ultimately financial responsibility lies with it. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1310</span>
authority is trapped, with no alternative but to go on defending the action. Surely we can agree that the matter should not be left like that. There must be a better system for dealing with such cases, under which a no-fault settlement to meet the immediate need would be nationally funded rather than dealt with by individual health authorities.<br><br>
This is the right moment to deal with the matter, because much Health Service provision is now being placed in contract form. The Bill clearly states that such contracts are not legal contracts. None the less, there is now a distinction between purchaser and provider. With whom does the responsibility lie? Admittedly the two parties may be two faces within the same authority, but with NHS trusts a different agency is involved. There will be the problem of deciding where ultimate legal responsibility lies. Does it lie with the agency that purchases the service or with the agency or institution that provides it? The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) has just mouthed an answer to that question. He says that the provider is responsible. I agree that logic and common sense dictate such an answer, but we have to consider whether, under the Bill, that is true. Would the responsibility lie with the NHS trusts rather than with the bodies that make the contracts? We are in deep water here. The Government should produce a scheme to prevent the purchaser-provider distinction being put to legal test, following a medical accident, with God knows what effects on the rest of the purchaser-provider system and its contractual implications? If they do not do that, they will be in grave difficulty.<br><br>
Now is the time to move. If the Government are not willing to do so, they should at least have the courage of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and say whether, in their brave new system, ultimate legal responsibility lies with the purchaser or the provider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene in the debate but I have changed my mind because so many important aspects of the subject have been raised by speakers from both sides of the Committee. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us when he replies. I was struck by what the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) said about people's difficulties and the length of time that it takes to achieve justice in compensation cases. I was also struck by the argument about the resource implications for authorities. As the hon. Member for Peckham said, such claims take a long time, just at the point of maximum strain, stress and disaster in the life of a family or an individual.<br><br>
The <i>Sunday Times</i> campaign on behalf of people who are not haemophiliacs but who have been infected by contaminated blood has a bearing on our discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) said that probably as few as 50 people are involved. I understand that the true number could be even lower.<br><br>
The other important argument involves the precedent set by the Barlow Clowes case. Effectively that was a no-fault settlement. The Government provided compensation and then took on the case. It would be helpful if the Minister told us what bearing that precedent has on our discussion.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only a few moments. I support what has been said by other hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) that it is not in order to pass between the Chairman and the hon. Member who has the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to be interrupted by you, Dame Janet, at what we all hope will be our final sitting— <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is bad manners to make seated interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to be interrupted not once but twice by you, Dame Janet, especially as you are ticking off somebody else rather than calling me to order. That is a new experience for me.<br><br>
This country has a bad track record on compensation, not only in the Health Service. The Barlow Clowes case was mentioned as a trend setter. There were talks at the time of the Piper Alpha tragedy, too. I remember the Leader of the Opposition raising the question of no-fault compensation at Prime Minister's Question Time. Several months ago I had a constituency case involving compensation delays. I am sure that I am not the only Member of Parliament to have had such cases. More than two years after the event a young man who had been the victim of an attack had still not received a settlement from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, despite the fact that it had been decided to award criminal injuries compensation. By international standards Britain does not do well on compensation. Other countries do better.<br><br>
In this ragbag of a Bill the Government are already forcing fast radical changes on to the Health Service. Surely they can take this opportunity to make a change that has been widely canvassed and debated. The idea of no-fault compensation has been subject to much greater scrutiny over the years than have many of the arrangements in the Bill—self-governing status, indicative drug budgets and so on. There is a wealth of knowledge. The case has been considered time and again. The <i>Sunday Times</i> campaign probably gave extra momentum for the idea. The time is right. Among all the other changes that the Government are making to the Health Service, surely they can make a change which has already been so fully canvassed. This is the ideal opportunity.<br><br>
There are legitimate worries that some of the changes made by the Bill will lead to certain aspects of our National Health Service becoming more like the American system. There are already ominous signs that British medical care may be moving in that direction. We do not want to subject doctors to the pressures caused by the American insurance-based system, under which litigation is the order of the day. People go to an attorney, think of a number, multiply it by 10 and head for the nearest court. No-fault compensation would be far more sensible. It is fairer and it is long overdue. The Government have a good opportunity to provide it now. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond both to the spirit and to the sense of what has been said by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My attitude to this serious subject is coloured by my experience as a defence Minister in 1986
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1312</span>
and early 1987, when I responded to pressure from service men to move back from a no-fault system to one which gave the right to sue in the courts. We examined carefully all the arguments. The basic contention was that no-fault compensation did not take account of individual circumstances, was too inflexible and rigid and was not sufficiently generous.<br><br>
There were hundreds of cases a year of service men and women being injured in accidents, possibly caused by negligence. Typical accidents occur in training, when someone breaks a leg, or, tragically, his or her back. Ministers were clearly told that those people wanted not a no-fault compensation system but the right to sue in the courts and achieve substantial damages. That was partly because of recent trends in damages awards—here I agree with the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman).<br><br>
Over the preceding 10 years awards had risen so high that service men and women felt genuinely disadvantaged when they saw awards 10 times higher than the sums available through the no-fault compensation scheme. They said that the Ministry of Defence arrangements were inadequate. I argued the case for the Government before Committees of the House of Commons. We accepted the criticism, dropped no-fault compensation and acceded to the logical and well-argued case of the service men and women. I have not checked but, some three years later, I am not aware of any problems in this much more flexible, just and equitable system—which, incidentally, results in most claims being settled out of court. Although legal proceedings might be initiated on behalf of a service man or woman, where the case is clear a settlement can be reached promptly.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible that, under the system to which the Minister referred in relation to the military, the settlements were accepted on the basis that they were full and final and that no additional claims might be made? My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) is a lawyer and the system that we are promoting would provide not for that but for a base level of claims. The person involved could make an additional claim by bringing a private civil action against the hospital concerned or the Health Service. Surely there is a distinction, and I ask the Minister to deal with it. If a person were to accept that there was full and final settlement of his claim, we would not be comparing like with like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I shall deal with the main thrust of this interesting although slightly different argument. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) argued that there should be a base level of compensation plus the right to sue. The hon. Gentleman will recall that I said that my attitude was "coloured by" but I shall deal with the logic of the hon. Lady's argument which begins to unravel. There is a better system in place although it can be improved, and I shall explain how we can tackle the problem.<br><br>
I sympathise with those of our constituents who have sometimes spent years pursuing claims for negligence against a doctor or a health authority and feel frustrated because they have not reached fruition. The hon. Lady has probably read the proceedings of the Adjournment debate concerning the excess radiation suffered by about 200 people at a hospital in Exeter. I had to deal with that debate and I am well aware, because of the arguments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1313</span>
advanced by Opposition Members, of the great anguish suffered by patients of the Health Service whose cases have not been settled and who have not received their just deserts.<br><br>
What the hon. Lady proposes can be provided in a different and more flexible way, but I shall deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), who asked, "Who are you suing—the purchaser or the provider?". The answer is that it is the person or body who commits the act of negligence and, in most cases, it would be the hospital, the trust or the directly managed hospital—the provider. However, I can envisage a few instances in which it would be the purchaser, that is, the district health authority. For example, if a DHA chose to send someone to the wrong hospital for critical treatment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady mentions no choice. Although I am not a lawyer, I should think that when there was an act of negligence in making that decision, the purchaser—the DHA—could be liable for an act of negligence in making the wrong decision and choosing the wrong contract for the treatment of the patient.<br><br>
To answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, in most cases the hospital, the NHS trust or the directly managed hospital would be responsible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Peckham mentioned three points which we should note in passing although they are not germane to the logical progression of either her argument or mine. One matter was doctors' accountability, and under her system preserving the right to sue would still mean that, ultimately, a doctor would be accountable for his actions. If patients were not satisfied with the minimum payment or thought that they could get more, they would certainly sue. The accountability of members of the medical profession for their acts is crucially important and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) is not throwing that principle out of the window. It is important to retain that principle, although the hon. Lady indirectly threw cold water on the notion.<br><br>
The concept of the accountability of doctors for their acts is still preserved with the new system that has operated since 1 January 1990 whereby a DHA will make itself responsible for acts of negligence of medical staff on duty. Before that date, the authorities were responsible in the same way for the acts of negligence of their non-medical staff. The accountability of doctors is not compromised because they have to face the patients in the courts and answer for their acts despite the fact that the health authorities will pay.<br><br>
5.20 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central raised an interesting point about mutual insurance within the Health Service. He made a sensible suggestion and perhaps regions should experiment with or move towards a form of mutual insurance. I question whether we are ready to take that step on a national basis or whether it would be advisable but, on a regional basis, it makes a great deal of sense to mutualise the risk of 10 or 14 districts. The isolated occurrence of a claim in any year against a district, which might amount to several hundred thousand pounds, could knock it off course. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1314</span>
consequent forcing of unwelcome economies could be avoided if the region mutualised the risk on the basis of an annual contribution which would need to be carefully assessed. Perhaps the districts could pick up the risk above a certain threshold which was mutualised. We should pursue that matter, which I understand is being considered, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's argument with care and much of what he is saying is genuinely enlightening. First, can we have a guarantee that a system of mutuality will be set in place to protect individual districts? Secondly, how does the Minister propose to deal with the position of self-governing trusts in that regard?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that the mutualising of risk was an interesting idea, but we should walk before we run. It would make sense to try it regionally first rather than nationally. It should be voluntary and not compulsory and be open to NHS trusts as well as directly managed hospitals. Expressed simply, the idea is that risks up to a certain threshold in any one year would, be collectively insured by the 10, 14 or greater numbers of districts in a region, with individual districts picking up risks above that threshold. It is a sensible, workmanlike idea that should be pursued, and I shall take appropriate steps to take it up with regional chairmen and general managers. As I have said, it should not be compulsory.<br><br>
There is no secret pocket in which resources can be found to pay the settlements of negligence cases. If I understood the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central correctly, he was not arguing that we should try to take £1 million or £2 million out of the Secretary of State's pocket from which the first tranche of payments would be drawn. All that we propose to do is to consider how a DHA can be protected against being blown off course by the settlement of an isolated incident which occurred in any one year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not deal with the case that I outlined, and I am sure that there are many more like it. Even if the principle of mutuality were accepted and there was a cold insurance arrangement, a case would still have to be brought to court. Where there is no base provision, the lawyers on one side will seek to establish whether he can legitimately defend a consultant and clear him of blame, while the lawyer on the other side will seek to prove that he was to blame. In the case that I described, there was insufficient evidence because some people were "unable" to come forward, so, in such cases, people would not receive the settlements that they should be granted. Unless the Minister can produce a system that would deal with the child to whom I referred, any other system will be insufficient. Does not he accept that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to deal with that. The hon. Gentleman outlined a disturbing case. If I were the hon. Member concerned, I should have complained to the Law Society about what seemed to be an unwillingness of lawyers to take on a legal aid case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first solicitor said that he could not deal with the matter and that there was no case. The second solicitor believed that there was a case. However, because the nurses on the ward were unwilling to substantiate the allegations made in the anonymous letter—the writer of which had first-hand knowledge of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1315</span>
what had happened—there was no basis on which the case could be proved in the event of it going to court. That is why the case was not pursued.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our legal system must be seen to be fair, and it must work. The circumstances to which the hon. Gentleman referred are worrying. The case may not be unique to the Health Service as there must be cases in other sectors when an inability to prosecute exists because of the lack of witnesses. The NHS cannot provide a specific solution to that problem.<br><br>
The hypothesis of the argument of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) might be wrong. Even in Sweden, a case of negligence must be proved before a no-fault payment can be obtained. An authority must adjudicate whether the condition was an act of negligence or whether it was, regrettably, the result of a foreseeable, tragic deterioration in the patient's health. One case out of three in Sweden is thrown out because negligence cannot be proved.Therefore, there would be no guarantee of a no-fault payment in the case sited by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Peckham argued about the delays in the legal system. She referred to the iniquities of the legal aid system and the inability of poor people to obtain proper justice. That is a wider issue, and it applies to many cases in all walks of life. She cannot necessarily argue the case for a no-fault system in the Health Service becase of delays that can, and should be, put right in the legal system.<br><br>
I have referred already to the case cited by the hon. Member for Workington, and we should realise that negligence still has to be proved, even in New Zealand and Sweden before a no-fault minimum payment can be obtained. That would involve the establishment of an adjudicating authority, the calling of witness and the examination of medical records.<br><br>
The kernel of the argument of the hon. Member for Peckham is to set a minimum level of payment and retain the right to sue. I believe that we can achieve what she is seeking, which is an early advance payment of compensation for patients who suffered as a result of acts of negligence, while still preserving the right to go to court for much higher sums. We understand that that process may take several years. The hon. Lady is asking us to set a national tariff that would apply to all cases in England, and which would deal, presumably, with several thousand different cases.<br><br>
That system would be too rigid and would inevitably result in sums being fixed at too low a level. Rather than have such a system that, as experience has shown in New Zealand, is too bureaucratic, it would be more sensible to establish a more flexible system. It would be worth considering setting up a process to encourage hospitals and health authorities, which are sued, to follow best practice in the Health Service. Clearly, some hospitals do not follow best practice in respect of the timetable for the calling of witness and for the making of interim payments —the so-called minimum payments to which the hon. Lady referred.<br><br>
Hospitals should be encouraged to give clearer guidance to patients on their right to legal aid. They should advise patients of the complaints procedure and the importance of seeking settlements, not necessarily in court. Patients should be advised to whom they should turn for advice.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1316</span>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like the Minister to finish his remarks without dealing with my specific point, which was made also by the hon. Members for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) and for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell). Will the hon. Gentleman extend the compensation scheme that has been set up for haemophiliacs who have contracted HIV to people who have contracted HIV from contaminated NHS blood products and who are not haemophiliacs? Will the Minister extend the scheme to cover those few cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the assurance that the hon. Lady seeks. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health, who has listened to the debate, and who is directly responsible for the matter would be happy to respond to that narrow, but important, point. There is a limited number of people who have had whole blood transfusions and are not haemophiliacs.<br><br>
Haemophiliacs have the right to sue and the Department of Health preserves the right to defend itself and argue that it was not negligent in its treatment that, regrettably, resulted in great tragedy. I emphasise that haemophiliacs were already substantially handicapped as a group. Clear cases of tragic misfortune are involved not only for those individuals, but their families. The lump sum payments of £20,000 per family is proof of the Government's understanding and recognition of the tragic circumstances of those individuals. Those payments did not constitute settlements out of court. In some cases, the claims of haemophiliacs will be pursued.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's argument is for an automatic no-fault minimum payment plus the right to sue. That system would be too rigid and too bureaucratic, and would result in various payments being set at too low a level. Indeed, it might well perversely discourage individuals from proceeding to sue because they or their advisers might consider that they had received their full entitlement. I prefer a more flexible system that would provide the right to sue and give clearer guidance to hospitals or health authorities on the best practice to follow. When something has clearly gone tragically wrong, some hospitals follow the good practice of early recognition of the problem, provide early counselling and consider making interim payments. Such a system would be a better and more humane way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I have to say is not directly relevant to my hon. Friend's argument. I share the anxieties of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) that much of the policy will be decided by judicial decisions in future. Is this not an issue on which judicial decision should be informed by public debate? Does my hon. Friend agree that we want clearer guidelines on what constitutes negligence and what constitutes attainable success in the Health Service? We have already seen that there is a conflict between locality and ease of access to a hospital on the one hand and the very best treatment available on the other. These are matters on which judges will, over time, require guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that there is any monopoly of wisdom in the Department of Health on what constitutes negligence. The process of medical audit, introduced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health and welcomed by the profession, may help to define what is best practice and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1317</span>
what is unacceptable practice. I should hesitate to say that the Department of Health and Ministers should seek to define what is negligent and what is not.<br><br>
I believe that in certain cases there is a great deal that could be done better in the Health Service to achieve—and I am not here drawing a direct parallel with the Exeter radiation case—speedier and more acceptable payments to those who have suffered, relieving their anguish but leaving them the right to sue. The hon. Member for Peckham may wish to press the new clause to a Division, but I hope that she will not do so because I am giving her certain assurances. We recognise the anguish that is felt by patients, and we are also willing to reconsider the point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central about mutualisation. We shall give clearer guidance to a—perhaps not in statutory form or in a formal circular but in some way to ensure that—best practice is followed throughout the Health Service.<br><br>
I hope that with those assurances the hon. Lady will not seek to divide the Committee on what is, I think, a common concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The substance of the Minister's case is that these matters will, in effect, still be resolved in the courts. Even if he accepts the principle of mutuality expounded by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), an aggrieved person or his or her representative would still have to bring an action in the courts to secure compensation.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) appeared to argue for a two-tier system: basic provision without resort to the courts followed by the right to bring a legal action.<br><br>
I do not mean to be unreasonable, but I think that the Minister has not grasped the essence of our case. We are trying to move the argument away from the courts and to another forum. The Minister has cited the practice in Sweden and in New Zealand. It may be correct that in those countries it is still necessary to prove negligence but it is also possible that in those countries the argument that takes place is not in the courts but in other forums attached to their health services. I do not know.<br><br>
Could we not devise a system whereby consultants who are not involved in a particular incident can adjudicate on whether, in their opinion, the problem before them arose out of the clinical practices used by the staff of a hospital —as in the case of the child with croup that I referred to earlier? Other consultants could adjudicate on whether there has been negligence. That removes the responsibility from the courts and takes out all the expense involved in adversarial proceedings. If the need to argue these matters is removed from the legal profession, witnesses will probably be more readily prepared to make statements. In the case that I mentioned the witnesses were not prepared to come forward, because they were worried that they would become involved in court proceedings and be seen to be arguing publicly in a court of law against the consultant involved. The hearings could take place behind closed doors. People could argue their cases, and consultants could invite in the staff on the ward who had been responsible at the time. Those people would tell the truth to the consultants, knowing that the consultant involved might not hear of their evidence.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1318</span>
There must be a case for removing these procedures from the courts and returning them to the medical profession. They must be dealt with, however, by people who are prepared to take an objective view, people who have neither a professional interest in protecting someone nor a pecuniary interest in making money out of the case.<br><br>
The Minister has not considered that aspect and is, in effect, leaving these cases in the courts. Under the arrangements outlined by the Minister, and even with the background financial arrangements suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham, the child in the case to which I referred would remain without recourse and would not receive damages, and the injustice would remain indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the Minister understands, as we do, the way that the NHS contract system will work he has made what I think is an electrifying admission. He said that there is to be a new area of negligence actions. Those solicitors and barristers who make their money out of medical negligence cases will have heard his comments with glee.<br><br>
The new area will involve the patient in suing the DHA, which is the purchasing authority, on the grounds that it has failed to purchase the services appropriate for that patient, or has chosen a hospital that the patient feels was not appropriate for his or her care. That will be a new area of negligence. At present, no patient can sue a DHA for choosing a hospital that is inappropriate and then claim that that wrong choice has damaged him or her. That is because it is not the DHA that makes the choice but the GP and the patient. Under the contract system it will be the DHA that makes the choice, and when the patient is locked into the contract system and goes into an inferior —possibly cheaper—hospital and is the victim of medical negligence, the action will be against the provider who negligently administers the care and against the purchaser who bought care that was so cheap that it did not provide what the patient needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies (Stanford and Spalding)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Gentleman, confident in the knowledge that he does not know what I am talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. I was beginning to wonder whether she knows what she is talking about. Is she aware that under present arrangements DHAs can, and frequently do, contract out operations to, for example, the private sector? Has the hon. Lady received legal advice that if something goes wrong under such circumstances the patient would never have a claim against the DHA? I have followed the drift of her argument and I suspect that she is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My suspicions that the hon. Gentleman does not know what I am talking about have been borne out. Perhaps I can help him. Of course, DHAs, contract out operations—and other treatment—to the private sector. We know that patients move from one DHA to another. At present, however, the patient does not have to go where the contract is, and is not prohibited from going where there is no contract. Therefore, if a patient suffers adverse effects, the decision cannot be made the basis of an action in negligence against the DHA. I hope that the Secretary of State will mark that prediction.</span></p>

<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listen with increasing amazement. As the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) knows, the decision about the hospital to which the patient should be referred is now taken by the general practitioner. That decision will be taken by the general practitioner in future. If an allegation arose that the referral itself was negligent, the action would lie against the general practitioner. That situation will be quite unchanged. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) suspected, the hon. Lady is trying to erect an argument based on the new contract system. As a lawyer, she too knows perfectly well that it is total twaddle. It has nothing to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the Secretary of State and his hon. Friends voted against an amendment that would have given patients and their GPs the right of referral, despite the NHS contract system. We debated that subject. It was clear that although there would be consultation about referral patterns, and although DHAs would have to consider pre-existing referral patterns, for a patient who did not have a fund-holding GP the decision would be made by the DHA that had placed the contract. The Secretary of State was not here when his Minister made that admission. Even if the Minister had not made that admission, we knew exactly what would happen because we heard the Government's arguments against our amendment on choice within the NHS contract system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share with my hon. Friend the feeling that we have entered a new, interesting and illuminating country in respect of NHS contracts. I place great importance on the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for Health, who said that purchasers might also be liable in respect of actions for negligence if they placed a contract with a hospital that could be considered the source of inferior or inappropriate treatment. That was a most important statement. Does my hon. Friend share my anxiety that the Secretary of State does not treat that informative and illuminating statement with respect and interest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully support my hon. Friend. If a GP makes a wrong referral decision and sends his patient somewhere where he cannot be treated, or is treated badly —if the GP makes a negligent referral—one can sue the GP.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) may laugh, but I am explaining how the present system operates. Under the NHS contract system, referral decisions will be made not by the GP but will be dictated by the contract. A decision about the contract placement that resulted in damage to the patient would be grounds for action against the purchasing authority. We can clearly understand that. I suspect that the Secretary of State also understands that, but it gives the game away and he will not acknowledge it.<br><br>
I welcome the fact that the Minister recognises that there is a problem and that he will consider giving guidance. I welcome the fact also that the Minister will reconsider the few tragic cases of those patients who, although not haemophiliacs, have contracted HIV from contaminated blood products. I know that hon. Members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1320</span>
on both sides of the House will support us when we resubmit those cases, asking for those cases to be added to the exception won by haemophiliacs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As two of my constituents are among the 32 cases that are known in the United Kingdom, I strongly support my hon. Friend. I remind the Committee that one of the problems for the small group who are HIV-infected is that there is no support mechanism for them. They are excluded from the support mechanisms for haemophiliacs, homosexuals and drug addicts. They are in distress and suffer financial anxiety, and they feel completely isolated. That feeling is reinforced by the Government's attitude towards compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I know that he will play a leading part in resubmitting those cases to the Minister for Health, which we shall do before Report.<br><br>
I welcomed the Minister's response, but I was disappointed. He did not make a promising start when he began by talking about service men and women. I do not believe that there is an analogy between the armed forces and the position that is recognised by patients' associations and the British Medical Association. The two positions bear no comparison. I urge the Minister to leave behind his experience in the Ministry of Defence and listen to the views of patients' organisations and the medical profession on victims of medical accidents. For all the Government's talk about consumers and patients' rights, they are not prepared to help when things go wrong. An organisation should be judged not only when it is doing things properly but on how it responds when things go wrong. At present, the system fails and is manifestly unjust to those patients for whom things go wrong.<br><br>
I welcome the support that we have had for the new clause. We shall not press the issue now, but will return to it on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

PARTICIPATION OF THE INDEPENDENT HEALTHCARE SECTOR</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>'The Secretary of State may, by order, direct a district health authority, a health board or a local authority to invite tenders for the provision of services from independent hospitals or homes, whether voluntary or private.'.—<i>[Mr. Nicholas Bennett.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the new clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
Independent hospitals throughout the country provide facilities for major operations on West German, Swedish and Norwegian patients. The complex cardiology and neurosurgery operations performed on adults and children are paid for by those countries' national social insurance systems. They find that they get better value for money, even after the cost of flights and hotel bills, than paying for the operation in their own country.<br><br>
District health authorities, acting as the social insurers for NHS patients, will be able to take advantage of the deals offered by independent hospitals participating in the provider market after April 1991. Initially, the hospitals may utilise spare capacity, but as they become more successful in winning contracts we can expect them to invest capital in building and equipping new units, or even
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1321</span>
new hospitals for the benefit of NHS patients. NHS patients will remain so. The ownership of the hospital in which they receive their treatment is not relevant and that treatment will continue to be financed out of taxation.<br><br>
During this year, DHAs and health boards will be negotiating contracts for individual patients and they will make contracts for block bookings for certain specialties. In future years, contracts will become more specific and more precisely defined. NHS hospitals will learn rapidly to price their procedures realistically and we shall see whether the independent sector can offer better value for money. We shall see that if DHAs invite independent hospitals serving their population to bid for contracts. Most will do so, but some may remain reluctant to involve private hospitals. The new clause would allow the Secretary of State to intervene to ensure that those additional sources of healthcare provision are exploited.<br><br>
The same applies for community care. We must ensure that choice is extended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us who will perform the operations in the independent hospitals? Will they be surgeons who have no connection with the NHS? Would not the same service be provided if surgeons worked full time for the NHS? Their NHS salaries and earnings could be increased, rather than paying them extra for their services in private hospitals on top of their NHS salaries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most interested in what the hon. Gentleman says. Some of the surgeons will work part time for the NHS and some will be fully independent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some surgeons work full time for the NHS; some work full time in the independent sector; and the vast majority work both in the private and public sectors. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that surgeons should not be allowed to work in both the private sector and the NHS, that will come as interesting news to the BMA and to the surgeons themselves. The basis of the formation of the NHS in 1948 was the independence of doctors and consultants and their right to decide whether to work in both the private and public sectors. If the Labour party is now changing its view and saying that consultants must work only in the NHS, I am sure that that will be noted by the BMA and the doctors. That would be an interesting change in policy. I am sure, however, that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is making up policy on the hoof, as usual, and that it will be repudiated later by his hon. Friends.<br><br>
I return to the community care sector. In the long-stay sector, we must ensure that choice is extended rather than restricted. At present, people requiring income support can choose their care home if its fees are covered by the amount that they receive. Relatives can top up the amount that is received, to an extent, if a slightly more expensive home is preferred. We must not lose that ability to choose when responsibility for funding passes to the local authorities.<br><br>
Most local authorities will work with the independent sector, contracting for nursing and residential care when their clients need it. They will be aware that the independent sector will be expected to invest billions of pounds in building new homes to meet the needs of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1322</span>
increasing numbers of elderly people. In the next 10 years, 100,000 more places will be required, 40,000 of which will be for publicly-supported people.<br><br>
Some local authorities are so suspicious of the private sector that they would prefer not to deal with it. They would rather than such places were not built if the local authority cannot build them itself. Some authorities have taken the extreme view that they will use the Bill's provisions to drive the private sector out of business.<br><br>
Such an attitude is inconsistent with the policy that the Government have outlined for the development of community care in both the private and public sectors. The independent sector has a major role to play and the Secretary of State should have powers to ensure that when local authorities act in a doctrinaire way in opposing the private sector he can override them, so that the private sector continues to be used.<br><br>
I refer to the savings that have been made by using the private sector and competitive tendering. In the past few years, we have saved £110 million, thanks to competitive tendering for support services in England. Under the waiting list initiative, almost 12,000 patients were treated by the independent sector in 1987 to 1989, allowing earlier treatment for NHS patients. In community care, many voluntary agencies are making major contributions to service provision and we believe that there is scope for further support from private suppliers to develop the service, as well as using the NHS and local authorities.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the entire Committee is grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) for his clear and lucid presentation of the arguments for new clause 30. He referred to contracts and I must tell the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) that on Thursday we hope to publish a document on Health Service operating contracts. I shall ensure that members of the Committee receive a copy on Thursday so that they may read it before Report. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) was interested in that document, which will contain examples of draft model contracts. I am sorry that it has taken so long to refine the document, but that has not held up our proceedings. There will be time for the Committee to study it before Report and I hope that it will help my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke.<br><br>
The Government share my hon. Friend's view that we want a mixed economy of care, with community care provided not only by local authorities but by the independent sector. My hon. Friend referred to the value of the independent sector to the Health Service and reference was also made to competitive tendering. Compulsory competitive tendering for catering, laundry and cleaning have saved the Health Service £110 million per annum. The criticisms of some of the contracts have concerned not the principle but the specific contracts. The quality has not been monitored but the value of the contracts is clear, but yet the Labour party proposes to abolish compulsory competitive tendering.<br><br>
The recent National Audit Office report on the NHS and independent hospitals, which is germane to the hon. Gentleman's argument, shows clearly that the Health Service, through long-term contracts of approximately £50 million per annum for treating NHS patients in private hospitals, receives good value for money.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1323</span>
I agree with the general thrust of my hon. Friend's argument. As a result of his probing amendment, my officials investigated the powers that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State already has. They advise me that under the National Health Service Act 1977, my right hon. Friend has powers of direction over district health authorities and under clause 44—the hon. Member for Pembroke participated in the debate on that clause—my right hon. Friend is given powers of direction over local authorities. He will have that power over the Health Service and local authorities, so the new clause is unnecessary.<br><br>
In asking my hon. Friend to withdraw the new clause, I am not disagreeing with the strength of his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the comments of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, it is clear that the powers exist with respect to district health authorities and local authorities. I see no point in pressing the new clause to a Division because that would only double the impact of what already exists in legislation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

<p>'It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to lay before the House of Commons an annual report on the working of fund-holding practices established under sections 13 to 16 of this Act.'—<i>[Mr. Leigh.]</i></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
When I was practising the trade that I share with the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Haynes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is a solicitor.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1324</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but mine is a similar trade, albeit one that the hon. Lady seems to decry. According to the rules of the Bar, I was always convinced of the excellence of my clients' cases. In trying to persuade juries of my argument, I often referred to the golden thread that ran through the case. The new clause goes to the heart of the Bill and, for that reason, it is important. The golden thread running through the Bill is the balance between resources and priorities. The Bill is concerned with accountability, too. This Bill is a winner and many other people share that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman should mention the poll tax. The phrase, "This Bill is a winner" was put to me by an hon. Friend who, while a member of the Conservative party, does not support the introduction of the community charge. He is noted for his independent views. The Bill is a winner because it is about increasing accountability and patient care. All members of the Committee want to improve the National Health Service and no one would dare to attack the NHS; it would be like attacking motherhood.<br><br>
Fund-holding practices will be an integral part of improving patient care. We are referring to large practices of 9,000 or more patients and the provision of safeguards. I hope that Opposition Members agree on the importance of Parliament keeping a close eye on fund-holding practices. My hon. Friend the Minister may claim that the motion is not necessary and that the Bill already povides for annual reports to be made. Indeed, GPs will have to produce annual reports on the activities of their practices to the FHSAs. I accept that the reports will be comprehensive and will contain information on the number of hospital referrals, the numbers and duties of the practice staff and the changes to practice premises. To that extent, I accept that my new clause may not be necessary.<br><br>
We are absolutely certain that the Bill contains sufficient safeguards to ensure that patient care will not be put at risk by funding-holding practices. Because ours is the rolling power, we shall be relying on the expertise and knowledge of GPs so that we can increase accountability. We shall be doing more to improve patient care. No doubt my hon. Friend the Minister will make those points. The root of the Bill is about funding and ensuring that public money is safeguarded. The new clause is necessary because Parliament should be given the regular, annual opportunity to debate the funding of the practices.<br><br>
Funding is rather like the logo on the leader page of <i>The Times,</i> in which a closed book is depicted on one side of the clock, and an open book on the other. This year alone, the Government have increased health spending by £2·5 million—an increase of 40 per cent, in real terms since 1979. That is an open book. We want to know the Opposition's attitude to NHS funding. I hope that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is listening carefully to my remarks.<br><br>
We are told that the Opposition are determined to make only the most limited of "firm spending commitments" and only those that they "must and can afford". It seems that beyond that they will set the direction of public investments and "the priority and choices". That is careful language. One might think that those were the words of one of my hon. Friends—perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Health. No; they are the words of the shadow Secretary of State. My hon. Friends
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1325</span>
will note that no mention was made of increasing NHS resources despite the fact that since 1979 there has been a 40 per cent, increase in real terms in spending on the NHS. In June 1989, the Leader of the Opposition said that the NHS would have to live in the real world. We, too, are talking about living in the real world. We are talking about balancing resources and priorities. That is why we propose fund-holding practices.<br><br>
The new clause and the yearly debates are necessary because one is drawn to the worrying conclusion that if a Labour Government came to power we would return to an era of real cuts. That lies ill with earlier statements, for instance that made on 14 January 1988 by the shadow Chancellor, when he advocated spending an extra £1·3 billion. Earlier statements seem to have been forgotten. That is why the new clause is necessary and why annual debates are needed. To facilitate today's debate, I am prepared to give way to interventions. If necessary, I shall give way to one of my hon. Friends; but I would rather give way to an Opposition Member so that, in the closing minutes of the Bill's consideration in Committee, they can tell us what their plans are for the funding of the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to spot when the hon. Member stops to draw breath.<br><br>
I look forward to annual debates of the sort that the hon. Gentleman proposes. It is such a delightful prospect that I guarantee that we shall all vote for the new clause when he puts it to a vote. I assume that he will now do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not good enough. The hon. Gentleman is noted as a keen debater. As we have seen in the past few weeks, however, his debating points have no substance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made a fair offer. I said that we would embrace an annual debate with delight. The hon. Gentleman may wish to request a short adjournment to ascertain whether the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) will permit him to vote for his own new clause. Our offer still stands. Should the hon. Gentleman fail to press his new clause, I assure him that we shall do so. He must rapidly decide whether to sit down and shut up or to vote for the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There we have it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Livingston wishes us to join him in securing the goods, he might at least put forward a modest deposit, saying what the Labour party is prepared to offer by way of resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a major debate in a major Standing Committee. Members of the press are present in great numbers. I have given the Labour party the opportunity to explain to the British people its view on the funding of the NHS, but there has been silence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps that is because the clause does not embrace the entire funding of the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we are now in the closing minutes of our consideration of the Bill in Committee, I shall make a brief literary allusion by quoting the opening words of the first chapter of "Tale of Two Cities":
<br><blockquote><p>"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1326</span>
season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us".</p></blockquote>
On our side, we have had the best of times, and the best of wisdom, belief, spring and hope. We had everything before us. How sadly that contrasts with what was presented by the Opposition—foolishness, the worst of times, incredulity and the season of darkness.</span></p>

<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), may I remind the Committee of some characters in "A Tale of Two Cities". Here on the Front Bench we have the portly figure of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State—the kindly Dr. Manette. Sitting next to him, we see Miss Manette, our heroine. Next on the Front Bench we see Mr. Darney, that good-looking hero of the party. But who is Madame Defarge? Who has that grace and charm? Who is Monsieur Defarge? May I give you a clue, Dame Janet?
<br><blockquote><p>"He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry dangerous man."</p></blockquote>
Surely it can only be the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours)!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has not cast the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). Was it "A Tale of Two Cities" or another novel that contained a Mr. Kremlin, who had only one idea and it was wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point well.<br><br>
I hope that I have convinced my hon. Friend the Minister of the importance of the new clause. The commitment of this Conservative Government to the NHS is clear and can be seen in the figures. What a pity it is that even in the closing minutes of our deliberations, after two months of debate, we hear nothing from Opposition Members about the resourcing of the NHS. Let us have that debate now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause is important because it has allowed my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) to ask an important question which the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) studiously avoided by playing tactics, instead of responding to my hon. Friend's very concise arguments about Labour policy on funding. In my view, it is important to keep an eye on what is happening, and my hon. Friend's new clause would enable the House to do that. So I hope that the hon. Member for Livingston will be more forthcoming on the question which was put to him, and which he studiously continues to ignore. I hope that it will be noted on the record.<br><br>
In the past, Opposition Members have given the impression that their intention is to scare patients to death. They have threatened; they have cajoled; they have frightened some of the most vulnerable members of society with allegations that they themselves know are untrue, and nowhere has that been more apparent than in our debates on indicative drugs budgets and fund-holding practices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way for the second time in a day. Does he not agree that the Opposition have also contributed to frightening doctors and general practitioners who may be contemplating this initiative? Surely, one benefit of my hon. Friend's new clause would be knowing how many GPs had decided
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1074">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1327</span>
in favour of fund-holding practices and how many, having signed up and received the benefit, with to withdraw from the scheme in subsequent years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the debate continues, may I point out that the terms of the new clause are relatively narrow, and I shall expect hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to take that into account in deploying their arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) makes an important point to which I hope, Dame Janet, that you will allow me to respond briefly. It is important to draw attention to these matters. I have no qualms about any of the provisions in the Bill, and we should follow what is happening annually—weekly, if necessary—and see what progress is being made in what we are trying to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend will respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who said that the Labour party had frightened doctors. My hon. Friend is wrong. The BMA, not the Labour party, has frightened doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was difficult, on occasions, to decide who was leading. Patients were frightened and the BMA withdrew its opposition to the indicative drugs budget. That did not stop the antics of Labour Members during the passage of the Bill.<br><br>
The new clause gives us the opportunity to debate resourcing in fund-holding practices. The responsibility to protect the interests of the NHS and of patients goes further than additional resources. No Labour Government has matched this Government's increase in spending on the NHS. The Government have ensured that there is extra money. Extra resources alone are no answer to the problems of the NHS. If throwing money at the NHS was the answer to its problems, the Government would have solved them already, and that is manifestly not so. There are still grave difficulties in the NHS. Anyone who does not welcome debate on the Bill is flying in the face of reality and of the future protection of patients' interests. The NHS was structured 40 years ago; it cannot meet the needs and demands of patients now and in the next century.<br><br>
It is essential for the true friends of the NHS to recognise that reform is necessary. Labour Members have argued vociferously about the grave difficulties facing the present system. No more eloquent case could be put for reform than the problems to which Labour Members have rightly drawn attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member continues, I remind him that this is not a Third Reading debate. We are debating a specific clause, and remarks must relate to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your strictures, Dame Janet and I apologise for getting carried away with my argument. I feel strongly about what I was saying, but I shall endeavour not to stray down that path again.<br><br>
Fund-holding budgets will not result in the horrors that the Opposition have identified. Those of us who seek the salvation of the NHS want it to react to the needs of this decade and of the next century. We will ensure that the issues are debated, and that there is a report. However strongly the Opposition may challenge us, Conservative
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1328</span>
Members have great faith in the Bill. When the public recognise that we are correct and the charges made by the Opposition are false, we, not they, will reap the benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make three brief, narrow points about the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). First, it is a probing measure. We shall listen carefully to the Minister's response before deciding whether to pursue the new clause, to withdraw it or to vote against it. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State knows, there has been a magnificent response to the proposal for budget-holding practices in Nottinghamshire, where 13 practices have expressed an interest. Two other practices—smaller than the 9,000 minimum—are also interested. Things are going extremely well in that part of the world.<br><br>
I visited an excellent practice in Arnold in my constituency, which is run by Dr. Fiona Coutts and has six excellent doctors, which will soon take possession of a magnificent new health centre. The doctors asked me whether they should have budget-holding status. I replied that it was a matter for them, but that I hoped that they would consider whether it was in the interests of their patients, which was the only point from which to consider the matter. It seems odd that some doctors on principle will not consider it; approaching the subject with a closed mind does not seem to be in the interests of the patient.<br><br>
Will my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State therefore assure me, because of the interest that has been shown in Nottinghamshire, that all applications will receive full and fair consideration, and that weight of numbers will not stop consideration from taking place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In connection with fund-holding practices and applications, my hon. Friend will know from my speech last week that 36 practices in Wales, which has few large practices, have applied to my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State because they are interested in holding their own funds. Has my hon. Friend considered why the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has kept so quiet in the debate, especially about the fact that those practices have applied? If a labour Government were in power, would they take away that freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. As he knows, the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is not normally silent on such matters and he is no doubt considering his response.<br><br>
The issue of accountability was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. The clause will give greater accountability, which is at the heart of the Government's legislation. Last week I discussed the role of the Audit Commission, of which I am a considerable fan, It can assist with value-for-money studies, and, with many of my hon. Friends, attach great importance to the issue of accountability and value for money, in the NHS.<br><br>
My hon. Friend will recall the words of the then Chief Secretary, our right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, after an additional increase in Government spending on the NHS, said that the importance of the reforms was that we need to know more about how the funds were being used. If my right hon. and learned Friend accepts the new clause, it will help to demonstrate cost-effectiveness, the way in which budget-holding practices will operate, whether there will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1329</span>
sufficient funding, and how that funding will be used. The Audit Commission will undoubtedly have a role in that issue as well and it bears strongly on the new clause.<br><br>
The Labour party has made it clear that it does not approve of budget-holding practices and that it will seek to reverse our legislation. It has made it equally clear that it is committed to ballots, which is an idea that has been explored on several occasions by the Committee. In the unlikely event of there being another Labour Government, and one minded to withdraw the provision of budgets for practices, will the Opposition give a commitment that there would first be a ballot of all the patients in those practices about the proposed action?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Dame Janet, that you would not want me to follow my hon. Friends down every path that they have taken to introduce the new clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) said when he set out excellently the background to the new clause, there seems to be complete silence from the Opposition in response to the general case that he made for the Bill. There has not been much genuine argument in quite a few of our debates. There is no genuine divide in the House on the NHS, and the principles followed by all parties in Committee about the NHS are indistinguishable.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle reminded us, we all know that the levels of funding for the NHS are unequalled in modern times. Speeches made by Opposition Treasury spokesmen show that there is no question of their committing themselves to an increase in NHS funding.<br><br>
Many of our measures are unlikely to be challenged by the Labour party, not least because, as was demonstrated by the lack of a response to a question put by my hon. Friend the Minister for Health, it has no alternative propositions for the future of the NHS.<br><br>
Fund-holding practices will become an important and established part of the NHS. My hon. Friends have talked about the need to improve accountability for the spending of NHS funds. It is an important innovation that GPs will have the opportunity to exercise more control over the financing of services for their patients. Those GPs will, as a practice, control funds of £750,000 or more depending on the make-up of their list. They will invest their funds in local services according to their judgment of the best quality and their patients' wishes and needs. Thus GPs will have a greater influence than ever before over the pattern of local services.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Secretary of State's extraordinary comment, which is presumably meant to draw a veil over our excellent line-by-line attacks on the Bill, will he cast his mind back to the sittings that he attended or to the reports of sittings that he did not attend and to our exposure of the fact that GPs will be restricted by many of the Bill's provisions and that their liberty and responsibility to their patients, will be curtailed. Unless he ignores every iota of our criticism of the Bill, how on earth can he sustain his extraordinary claim?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have attended a high proportion of the Committee's sittings and I have heard most of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1330</span>
Opposition's arguments refuted. The contractual system will give GPs more influence than ever over the development of services for patients in their locality. Large practices that take the opportunity given to them in the early stages of the reforms to take on fundholding will have extraordinary influence over the developing pattern of services. If one goes round the country and considers the way in which GPs and health authorities are preparing for the change, one finds that health authorities and hospitals are taking far more notice of GPs' preferences and referral patterns than before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that he had attended a high proportion of our sittings, at which he heard the arguments advanced by my hon. Friends refuted. Only four and a half minutes ago he said that the two sides of the Committee were in total agreement. Can the Secretary of State explain to me the resulting paradox? If there is agreement between both sides of the Committee, why have he and his colleagues in the Treasury not found it in their hearts to accept any amendment moved by Opposition Members to any of the health clauses of the Bill? If there is no difference between us, surely in the past two and a half months the right hon. and learned Gentleman could have found one amendment on which we agreed and accepted it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that there was no difference in the principles of both sides of the Committee on NHS policy. Both sides agree on the principle of providing a comprehensive service, free at the time of delivery to the patient. Both sides are committed to funding that largely out of general taxation. Both sides admire the NHS as an institution. The debate between us is a rivalry about which side is best fitted to improve the quality of the NHS.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) affects to believe that we have a hidden agenda to privatise the Health Service, but I do not think that he seriously believes that. There is no underlying difference of principle between us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that one of the most unsatisfactory aspects of the Committee's proceedings is that on almost every clause, whether on primary health care, the hospital sector, or community care, the Opposition have said over and again that the fundamental problem is that the Government are not spending enough and that the Bill cannot be implemented because there will be insufficient funding. Yet when they are asked how much extra funding they would provide for the Health Service they avoid the question. Does not that show the Labour party's fundamental lack of credibility and respectability?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In so far as I can detect the Opposition's policy on the Health Service, they heavily rely on a continuous hint that they would somehow spend more money on the NHS than Government have done. That flies in the teeth not only of their past performance in Government, but of their detailed statement on the issue. As far as I am aware, the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has never given a commitment to increase spending on the NHS. The Leader of the Opposition's words on the subject have been gloriously vague and hesitant. The shadow Chief Secretary, in speeches on public expenditure on the Floor of the House, has made it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1331</span>
crystal clear that the Labour party has no priority commitment to increase NHS funding faster than the Government.<br><br>
There have been many detailed amendments, but I had not realised that we have not accepted one from the Opposition. I do not believe that the Opposition have demonstrated that GPs will be inhibited by the legislation. The contractual system has been exhaustively explained by my hon. Friends and myself. We have made it clear that GPs' ability to refer will remain unimpaired. There will sometimes be the need, as there is now, to ensure that access to hospitals remains open to GPs and that funding is arranged for it. It will be easier for GPs to exercise their judgment as to where patients are referred when, unlike the present system, taxpayers' resources are available to back that judgment and to finance the receiving hospital for its services.<br><br>
It is believed that fund-holding practices will be inimical to GPs, will reduce their freedom to refer, and will not be an attractive opportunity for them. Yet, as my hon. Friends the Members for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) and for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) said, the reaction of GPs supports the Government case. The proposal for fund-holding practices has been heavily attacked by the BMA and the Labour party still attacks it.<br><br>
We have sent to every GP an extremely clear and informative leaflet which explains our proposals. Those with practices of fund-holding size were especially asked to study it. The result was the same, not only for Nottinghamshire and Wales, but across the country. A clear majority of GPs, in practice that might be eligible for fund-holding have expressed a positive interest in holding such funds. My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling asked whether I would give an assurance that, the large number of expressions of interest in Nottinghamshire would not prevent the consideration of individual expressions of interest. Certainly, I give him that assurance. We propose to respond to the hundreds of expressions of interest by carefully considering the circumstances of each practice. I know that the RHAs will consider each of them in a similar way.<br><br>
We face a practical problem in that it might not be possible for the Government and the RHAs to decide which of the first wave of interested practices should become fund-holding from April 1991, because of the enormous number of applications. It is important that we proceed carefully in implementing the reforms and make sure that our innovations are well judged. We want to ensure that the first fund-holding practices are well-judged, with a good management capacity, and that the budget is carefully calculated by both the RHA and the practice. The RHAs in Wales and the Welsh Office, will have to make sure that fund-holding practices can be comfortably managed.<br><br>
We intend to develop the idea in the light of experience —the reforms will be implemented by an evolutionary process. We believe that fund-holding practices will be a success, and that, because of the attractions of the scheme, we shall come under increasing pressure from GPs— including those who do not have practice lists of the size stipulated for the first wave of applicants—to allow them to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State has been converted to doing things in a well-judged and reasonable way, why does not he seek to do things by pilot and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1332</span>
experiment instead of ramming his Health Service reforms down the throat of the country, which does not want them? Does he accept that in practice he ignores the principles that he asserts, such as those asserted in his peculiar speech today, while the Opposition apply their principles and take practicalities into account? That is a major difference between the Government and the Opposition, and people are aware of it. That is why doctors are so suspicious of the Secretary of State. He is determined to steamroller the Bill through Committee, ignoring many reasoned and sensible amendments. Surely it is too late for him to try to appear reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are piloting fund-holding practices. I do not understand the ridiculous debate about pilot studies. General Practitioners with the right number of patients are at liberty to apply for fund-holding practice budgets. We have sent them the details and invited them to apply. If a GP applies, the RHA will evaluate his or her capacity to manage the fund, and together they will negotiate a level of funding that both feel confident will cover the relevant range of services required for the patients on the GP's practice list.<br><br>
During the first few years we shall see how successfully practices manage their funds and how popular the innovations are with patients. If, after a year or two, some practices do not like the scheme or cannot cope with managing their funds, they will be allowed to revert to the previous arrangement. That will be the only penalty. If, as I expect, we get better at calculating budgets correctly, more practices become successful at managing funds, and more GPs find that they can greatly influence investment in local services, I am sure that fund-holding practices will spread. If that is not piloting, evolutionary and experimental, I do not know what it is. I do not understand how hon. Members can advocate piloting and vote against our proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that several practices have applied to join the scheme. Does he accept that there is much evidence that many practices fear the sanctions that may be brought to bear if they do not apply? If the Secretary of State does not believe me, I can produce evidence from my constituency. I have received letters from GPs who say that they do not believe in the principle of the scheme, but are applying to join because they believe that sanctions may be imposed on them and that problems will occur in their practices if they do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What sanctions? No sanctions are proposed for a GP who exercises his or her undoubted right not to apply to be a fund-holding practice. I have never heard such nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree, despite the political agitation that followed the White Paper's publication, that all the applications from potential fund-holding practices prove that doctors are voting for the reforms with their feet? If only on humane grounds, surely we should express some sympathy for the natural discomfiture of the Opposition, all of whose predictions are being shown to be humiliatingly wrong.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. When eligible GPs are asked whether they want to apply for the funds and are told that there are no sanctions either way—when the proposals are clearly explained—I cannot think of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1333</span>
better example of their reaction to the reforms than when the vast majority apply. I have not heard the Labour party say that it will repeal the measure and I do not want to encourage it to do so. I do not believe that once the arrangement is introduced any political party will go back on it. I believe that the BMA will eventually try to forget its rather embarrassing opposition which it adopted too quickly.<br><br>
The new clause relates to reporting back to Parliament. I am sure that we shall frequently do so. Indeed, in the near future, I look forward to reporting to Parliament on the exact number of expressions of interest that we have received and how we propose to handle them. We shall keep the House as up to date as possible on the progress of the experiment with fund-holding practices. I should prefer not to be placed under an obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the question of reporting to Parliament, perhaps I may draw my right hon. and learned Friend's attention to the fact that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has consistently asked parliamentary questions about comparisons between 1974 and 1979 and 1979 and 1989. In each case, the figures show that this Government are spending more in real terms—two or three times over—than the previous Labour Government. The hon. Gentleman never press releases that information. The word processor of the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) may have broken down. Can my right hon. and learned Friend assure us—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Even at this late stage in our proceedings, my rule remains. Interventions should be short.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. and learned Friend assure us that when questions are answered in Parliament for Opposition Members and they fail to circulate the good news that is contained in the answers, he will ensure that his Department does so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to answer such questions without good news. We shall continue to answer them and to report regularly to Parliament on our handling of the NHS and the implementation of the reforms, especially on fund-holding practices.<br><br>
I expect fund-holding practices to become an established part of the service in due course. I do not wish to place the Government or successive Governments under a legal obligation to produce an annual report on that feature of the service. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) will withdraw the new clause, but accept that he has given us an adequate opportunity briefly to touch base again with the principles underlying the reforms. The debate has also highlighted the fact that, in such discussions, the Labour party is unable to make a sustained contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) rightly rebuked me for my failure to press release the information that I received from parliamentary answers about the respective performance of the previous Labour and present Conservative Governments.<br><br>
Perhaps I may give the Committee some data—I fully accept that I have been remiss in not sharing such data with the wider public—which I am sure it would like to hear. The data were supplied to me by the Minister of State
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1334</span>
in a parliamentary answer in January. A comparison of appointments to the NHS under the previous Labour and the present Conservative Governments reveals that under the Labour Government 12,000 new posts for doctors were created in five years, but that for the first nine years of this Government the figure was 8,000. Taking account of the difference between five and nine years, the rate of increase in the number of doctors appointed under this. Government has fallen to a quarter the rate of increase under the Labour Government. In five years the Labour Government appointed 44,000 new nurses. In nine years of the Conservative Government, 33,000 have been appointed. Taking account of the difference in time, that is exactly half the rate of increase in the number of nurses. These figures refer to the number of posts. They do not take account of the sharp reduction in the number of nursing hours for each full-time post under this Administration. When that is taken into account, the rate of increase in the number of nurses under this Government has fallen to one quarter the rate of increase under the Labour Government.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd reminded me that the figures were produced by Ministers. They show starkly and in real terms, rather than in bogus financial figures, how much the Government invested in health.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why nurses' pay was cut by 30 per cent, in those five years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The new clause will not support that argument. It is already overloaded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would not support such a patent untruth. The hon. Gentleman knows that he is taking the peak after the Houghton award in 1975 and comparing it with the trough immediately before the Clegg award in 1979—the Clegg commission was appointed by the Labour Government. Even if that were discounted and account was taken of nurses' pay in the lifetime of the Labour Government, it would not produce a 30 per cent, cut. You are right, Dame Janet, to say that it would be unfair to load the new clause with such a patent untruth. It would also be unfair to the new clause, which is excellent in many respects. I shall support it, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) discovered, more fulsomely and enthusiastically than the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I am not surprised that a significant number of eligible practices have applied for a fund-holding budget. Those practices share our grave and serious anxiety about the contractual relationships that will be formed between district health authorities and family health services authorities. To apply for their own fund-holding budgets is the only way in which GPs and their patients will escape the consequences of that commercial, contractual relationship between the health authorities.<br><br>
We would warmly welcome an annual debate on the consequences of practices having fund-holding budgets. We would like to discuss what happens when GPs bump up against the cash limits of a fixed budget—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will not be cash limited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course they will be cash limited. There cannot be practice budgets without there in turn being cash limits.<br><br>
An annual debate would expose the fact that patients go not to the hospital of their choice, but to the hospital with which the practice has negotiated the cheapest prices.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I1078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1335</span>
We want a debate about patients who, because they are chronically sick or disabled and require expensive treatment, will become unpopular. That is happening now, in anticipation of the changes in the Bill. I can understand why the Secretary of State does not welcome the opportunity for a full annual debate on the issue. The Opposition will be proud to vote with the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From this high bank, I cast a fly over the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) as he sat sulking in the pool for the first three quarters of an hour of this debate. The debate is about NHS funding, but the hon. Gentleman studiously avoided answering questions about it. His lack of response contrasts with the forthright way in which my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State sought to answer my questions. In the light of his assurances that he wants to report regularly to Parliament on fund-holding practices, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1336</span>
After the events of the last few minutes, it is worth pointing out that the new clause stands in my name and that of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). That is an unholy Highland allegiance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of <i>Hansard,</i> the hon. Gentleman should explain that he means "alliance" rather than "allegiance". Does not the hon. Gentleman understand the difference?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many Englishmen and Welshmen have lived to regret the way in which they offended Highlanders.<br><br>
At first glance, the new clause may appear to be innocuous. It relates to the general community care needs of persons within each local authority area.<br><br>
Ministers will be aware that many regional councils and health boards share the same boundaries. Needs must include good health and the promotion of good health.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye mentioned the atmosphere in the Committee. The Minister must seriously consider the need within the Health Service to promote good health. That is especially important in Scotland; our health record is not good. Diet, and practices associated with diet, leisure and recreation have a bearing on good health.<br><br>
I hope that serious thought will be given to the establishment of new health boards. Ministers already have the necessary powers in part II, and I hope that the new health boards, when established, will be primarily concerned with the promotion of good health and the eradication of practices that in Scotland have led to the need to spend large amounts of additional public money on health care. I do not object to that, because I take the view that public funds should be used to rectify problems, but we should spend those funds in a way that rectifies the cause, rather than the effects.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear in mind what I have said. I hope, too, that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, with whom I colluded in tabling the new clause, will realise that I have had in mind what he said about the atmosphere in the Committee, and I hope that he will forgive me if, in the short time during which I have spoken, I have omitted to say some of the points that he and I wished to raise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In less than a minute, I hope to complete the unexpected Highlands axis that has arisen in the Committee's closing stage. We are grateful for the drafting help that we were given with the new clause, because it has allowed the Committee to have a short exchange of views on health promotion. Perhaps I am pre-empting the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) when I say that I am not as fine a specimen of the activity of health promotion as is the fit, teetotal, non-smoking hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I claim no consistency in any of those three categories but, like Harold Macmillan, who said when he introduced premium bonds that he was trying not so much to save sinners as to make sinners save, I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that health promotion is for those who are already on the road to Damascus and those of us who have yet to be turned. We look forward to his response.</span></p>

the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) for raising this subject.<br><br>
I shall respond briefly. We are at present giving serious thought to the health promotion and health education strategy in Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North was incorrect to suggest that there are powers in the Bill to establish a special health board similar to the special health education authority in England, but I can give him and the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye an undertaking that I shall bear the matter in mind when considering the Touche-Ross and other proposals on health promotion. On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend will be prepared to withdraw the motion, as there may be an opportunity to consider the matter further at a later stage.</span></p>

</ol></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and question proposed,</i> That the schedule be read a Second time.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'> May I ask the Minister to explain the part of the new schedule that refers to the testing of animals? It says that, under the Medicines Act 1968, there will be an operative assumption that an applicant for a licence to test animals will be deemed to be in possession of that licence before it is actually granted. This is a rather worrying new principle and I hope that the Minister can explain it to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The general principle behind the part of the schedule to which the hon. Gentleman referred is that, by removing Crown indemnity, we shall render hospitals of whatever nature and in any part of the National Health Service subject to the full procedures of the Medicines Act 1968. They will have to clear themselves with the appropriate authorities in the same way as a large, independent, pharmaceutical company. We merely seek to remove the existing indemnity.<br><br>
I do not have the answer to the hon. Gentleman's specific question but I assure him that I will investigate the matter and write to him. I shall be happy to send copies of the letter to all members of the Committee. I am sorry that I cannot immediately answer his question, but I do not believe that the general principle is compromised. We are withdrawing Crown immunity with three specific exceptions. There are good and sensible reasons for those exceptions, although I am sure that the Committee would not wish me to go into them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the Minister's inability to answer my question because paragraph 11 of the new schedule appears to give an NHS trust or another Health Service body the right to act as if it held a licence to test and conduct clinical trials on animals without being in possession of such a licence. I hope that he will provide a full answer at an early date.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1342</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is only a transitional point, in the sense that it would be unreasonable to expect the medicines control agency to tackle every NHS hospital on day 1. The hon. Gentleman seeks an assurance that we will endeavour to ensure that that agency acts as quickly as possible in reviewing all practices that fall within the Medicines Act 1968 and I am happy to give it. But it is unrealistic to expect, that all practices affected by the Act should be reviewed on day 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's argument and I appreciate that there are difficulties. But can he give us an assurance that there will be strict time limits on the deemed permission? If he cannot immediately tell us the limits of the transitional period, will he inform us of what they are at an early date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the assurance that I have given the hon. Gentleman. I shall write to him to give details of the length of the transitional period and I shall copy my letter to all members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his reply to us, will the Minister advise us whether there is a reason for the provision being unlimited as to time? Should not the deemed permission expire within a set period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a point of policy and not the proposal, although I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. The proposal is to withdraw the immunity and for the medicines control agency to act. I will respond speedily to ensure that it reviews all existing practices for which there must be deemed to be permission, otherwise the whole of our system for the production of pharmaceuticals and the conduct of experimentation will come to a halt. I am seized of the point and will write to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

I make my first non-controversial contribution in the Committee to thank you, Dame Janet, for the courteous and competent way in which you have chaired our proceedings. Dame Janet, you have been stern and authoritative at times and, if I may draw a veil over the first morning of our proceedings, you have usually silenced members of the Committee with a glance. Throughout our proceedings, you have retained our respect and confidence, and we are all extremely grateful to you for the great courtesy with which you have conducted our affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. At the risk of the Secretary of State quoting me in future as accepting the principle of the Bill, I share his remarks and thank you for your patience, courtesy and calmness in presiding over our deliberations. I congratulate you because you, uniquely among all members of the Committee, are now spared attendance when the Bill is considered on Report.<br><br>
I express the thanks of those who attempted to table and move amendments to Mr. Jack for his courtesy and diplomacy when frequently pointing out that our amendments and new clauses were technically defective, out of order and could not possibly be called. He has a certain tact which Ministers could learn. Finally, may I commiserate with the other Conservative members of the Committee, who are about to leave one of the rare corners of Britain in which a majority can be found in support of the Bill. They are about to enter a world in which, as was confirmed only yesterday, 82 per cent, of NHS staff are solidly against the Bill. That is the majority that will put a stop to the clauses that have been whipped through the Committee.</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) and myself, representing our respective parties, I echo the thanks that have been expressed. For the courtesy that has been extended to us I thank hon. Members on both sides of the Committee especially the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and the Labour Whip, the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay), who has allowed us, where appropriate, to nestle under his protective wing but who has not been afraid to expose us, either, when he thought that that would be advantageous. We thank you, too, Dame Janet, and the Clerk. The courtesy, patience and consideration extended to us have been much appreciated throughout the proceedings of the Committee.</span></p>

made. As I am something of a glutton for punishment, although my part in the Bill's progress will be finished I may be seen on Report. I have enjoyed presiding over the Committee. As is proper, I am not allowed to make my views known, but I have listened to the debates and they have been most interesting. I hope that all will go well from now on.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1346</span>
Finally, on behalf of us all, I thank the printers, whose task has not been of the easiest, and the <i>Hansard</i> staff, whose tasks are especially heavy at this time of year. They are usually unheralded and unsung so it is right that I as Chairman should thank them on the Committee's behalf.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
