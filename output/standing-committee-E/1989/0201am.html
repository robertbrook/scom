</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are important because they seek to protect the doctor's right to prescribe in the patient's best interest. The traditional confidence of patients in doctors is in danger of being undermined unless the amendments are accepted. That confidence is the basis of our Health Service. The Opposition find it incredible that the Government are prepared to put it at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crisis of the moment involves the ambulance service, which is vital in time of emergency or sudden illness. The Government's reluctance to negotiate is straining the loyalty of ambulance workers unbelievably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many other examples of the Government's unwillingness to listen to those who deal with our health day in and day out. The worst has been the unseemly wrangle between the Secretary of State for Health—I regret that he is not taking part in today's debate, as his personal opinions are of such importance —and doctors who have sought to safeguard the
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
doctor-patient relationship. The differences in the statements about meetings on that dispute cast serious doubts on the Government's intentions. The amendments provide the Secretary of State and the other Ministers with a chance to come clean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many statements, the Secretary of State has claimed to have met doctor's demands, but the BMA has made it clear that serious doubts remain. Even if the doctors were satisfied by the Minister's undertakings, that would not be enough; my plea is on behalf not of doctors, but of patients. If the Minister for Health is serious in her wish to reassure doctors and the public, she will accept the amendments. If she does not accept them, she will cast further serious doubt on the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indicative drug budgets will impose a financial restraint upon drug prescriptions. The Minister has claimed that they will not. The Secretary of State has claimed that the Government's management proposals will not infringe a GP's right to prescribe all the medicines that individual patients require, but he has refused to clarify that unequivocally for those who are suspicious of his intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A doctor might still have the right to prescribe the drugs that a patient requires, but he will have to balance the needs of various patients in order to stay within his budget. What does the right of which Ministers have spoken really mean? There will be clear limits on budgets at family practitioner level. How will they be kept to without limiting individual doctors? There will be clear limits at area health authority level. How will they be kept to without limiting individual doctors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have not been satisfactory answers to these questions. In Wales, there is no RHA to remonstrate with the Secretary of State for Wales if problems arise—not that remonstrating with the right hon. Gentleman always produces results. It produces courtesy, but not always results. The Secretary of State for Wales is therefore judge, jury and treasurer in his own court. That is not satisfactory. There has been no response to the anxieties expressed by doctors in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are restating a right for GPs but hedging that around with administrative and budgetary restrictions, thus putting doctors in a double bind. Ministers seem to think that they can persuade the BMA to accept vague promises about how the Secretary of State for Health will implement financial management arrangements that have not yet been published. There is doubt about that, but even if they did, there would still be no basis for confidence among members of the public, patients and doctors who are suspicious of his intentions. If the Secretary of State means what he says, he and the Minister for Health can prove it by accepting three of the amendments before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 would ensure that there were no financial or other sanctions against a practice that exceeded its drug budget. Amendment No. 15 would ensure that a doctor did not lose pay for exceeding his or her indicative drug budget. Amendment No. 14 would ensure that a doctor did not have to apply to a family practitioner committee, as it is now called, before exceeding the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the cash-limited, money-dominated ethos that the Government are creating in the Health Service there will be plenty of encouragement to save money when that can be done without hurting patient care. Most doctors are enthusiastic about cutting waste in medical practice, when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
that does not damage patient care. Patients and the public understand the need for financial responsibility. All doctors support positive developments such as medical audit undertaken by their peers. That means judgment on prescribing being made by doctors, not by administrators and accountants. We cannot accept the Government's diktat on a topic on which they have produced no real evidence. Prescribing in the United Kingdom is low compared with that in many other countries. Our doctors are not profligate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not explored the alternative of management by reason and consensus. Indeed, one sometimes wonders whether they understand the words. The Minister has a simple choice: the hon. Lady can accept the amendments and be believed, or reject them and confirm the worst fears of doctors, patients, consumer groups, the media and the Opposition that the Government are intent on pursuing a piece of damaging ideological nonsense without regard for evidence or common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the Secretary of State would be here to amplify what he said on 10 October:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The firm budgets for drugs at RHA and FPC level will not operate as cash limits. The management arrangements proposed by the Government will not infringe in any way the right of a general practitioner to prescribe all those medicines which individual patients might need. These points will of course be carried through into our legislative proposals to Parliament."</p></blockquote>
In order to do that, the Minister must accept our amendments. She will be breaking a promise made by the Secretary of State if she does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been accusations that the BMA misunderstood the Government on the drugs budget. The Government say that they have no intention of depriving patients of the drugs that they need. But the wording in working paper 4, section 9 is clear:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Legislation will be needed in order to require FPCs and RHAs to keep to their drug budgets".</p></blockquote>
That can only mean a cash limit. Working paper 4 states that an FPC might encourage the local development of repeat prescribing control systems and formularies. It refers to the need to monitor individual practices, and to doctors making use of the prescribing analysis and cost system data. The six FPCs have piloted the proposals only during the 1989–90 financial year. Time has not been given to learn the lessons from those six pilot schemes. That is simply not a good enough way to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen at regional level if the total drugs budget exceeds the allocation? We have been told that there will be a firm limit. Will the money have to be provided at the expense of other parts of the service? If a central contingency fund is to be available, what will it be and how will it work? In what circumstances does the Secretary of State envisage that the consent of the FPC will be required? The FPC will be given power, but we have not been told what restraints there will be on it. Administrators and accountants will be placed under obligations by the Government. How will their inclinations be limited so as to deliver the promise—I emphasise that it is a promise—that doctors will not be subject to financial constraints when they prescribe the drugs and medicines required by their patients?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November, the Secretary of State said that family doctors who took the budgets with which to buy hospital
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
care would be given money for drugs within them and expected to keep to their overall budget. In other words, doctors will be free to prescribe within the practice budget, but it will be a peculiar freedom, because they will be able to prescribe only at the cost of other elements in their budget for patient care. Their right, therefore, will have no meaning or validity. Once more, I emphasise that the Secretary of State's promise in his letter of October cannot be kept without the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other GPs will be given indicative drug budgets for medicines and, as the Secretary of State said, they
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be expected to take this budget as a bench mark of what they ought to be prescribing".</p></blockquote>
However, the Labour party has shown that practices can be subject to many pressures. Within one practice there are variations in the requirements of patients, and there are different social requirements. There is no background of years of experience with pilot studies to suggest that the system can work or to show where safeguards should be built in. The Minister does not have access to experience from which to show that safeguards will be established in the new management systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public and patient confidence is important. A 1989 poll showed that nearly 25 per cent. of the sample believed that the plan to give doctors a drug budget would lead to doctors failing to prescribe expensive drugs, even—and I stress this—when they were necessary. Half the poll sample thought that the drugs budget would make doctors "more careful". In what way can GPs be more careful? Not by being more careful about what they prescribe for a patient, but in the way in which they control their finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Care about the way in which prescriptions are issued should be encouraged through every mechanism and in co-operation with every part of the Health Service, including doctors. Doctors should not use the other sense of "prescription", which is the sense used in the Bill. I warn the Government of the public's worry, which is reflected in the poll and which has grown rather than diminished as a result of what I called the unseemly wrangle between the Secretary of State and the doctors. The unseemliness was on the part of the Secretary of State, not the doctors. They were simply trying to protect the freedom that the Secretary of State promised in his letter of October, but which is not safeguarded in the legislation. The view of the consumer was expressed in a 	<i>Which</i> report in answering the question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What happens if my GP takes a practice budget and runs out of money before the end of the year?"</p></blockquote>
The answers given in the report were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"GPs have four options. They can overspend, and the money will be deducted from the next year's allocation; they can try to negotiate extra money; they can start their own waiting lists; or they can refuse to pay for your treatment."</p></blockquote>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When such constraints are imposed on doctors, what price will they pay for the right to prescribe medicines required by patients? Unless the prescribing rights of doctors are written into the Bill, which the amendments would ensure, the Secretary of State's promise is meaningless. In a speech to the Royal College of Physicians, the Minister for Health said of the indicative drug budget:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We hope that this will bring downward pressure to bear on the ever-increasing drug bill and cause doctors to think about their prescribing habits."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
That implies that doctors do not think about their prescribing habits, and that the Government do not want to work with doctors and the Health Service to encourage positive thinking about drug budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said earlier that the majority of GPs are responsible in prescribing drugs. None of my hon. Friends would disagree with that, but what does the hon. Gentleman propose to do about GPs who do not act responsibly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition believe that such doctors should be dealt with through medical audit. Ways of dealing with the overprescriber already exist. I acknowledge—as do most doctors—that irresponsible doctors are in a minority. I agree that they need to be dealt with, but the Government's proposals are a blunt instrument, and they will take away from all doctors the prescribing rights that the Secretary of State promised to respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 17 proposes that the family health services authorities do precisely what the hon. Gentleman requires. Qualified people will examine prescribing practices and decide whether doctors have overspent their indicative budget because of special circumstances or because they have not been prescribing on a proper basis. The hon. Gentleman seems not to understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such a provision is not written into the legislation, which contains a presumption against the right of doctors to prescribe. The hon. Gentleman's interpretation of clause 17 is consistent with the amendments, so he need not worry. Conservative Members are involved in a Catch 22 situation. They cannot have it both ways. If clause 17 means what the hon. Gentleman claims, the Minister should take note of his argument and vote with him in support of the amendment. If, however, clause 17 has a different meaning, the Minister will reject the amendment, and the Government's real intentions will be exposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the fact that powers already exist to deal with overprescription and that they are being used. It is interesting that during the 18-month period ending in December 1989, local medical committees made 18 decisions against the prescribing practices of GPs and 94 decisions to reclaim costs from GPs. Those figures appear to show that the process of medical audit, to which my hon. Friend referred, justifies the prescription practices of GPs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. As my hon. Friend said, there is not the profligate spending under the present system that the Government pretend. They are unwilling to put to the test in a public forum their views on the need for financial control and their belief that it would not infringe doctors' ability to prescribe what their patients need. The Bill as drafted puts an excessive restraint on doctors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members share the hon. Gentleman's view that a medical audit is important. But if there is to be a medical audit, there must also be certain yardsticks. An indicative drug budget is a yardstick of whether the practice is prescribing in a responsible way, having regard to medical and other circumstances. How can there be a proper medical audit if there is no yardstick?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman, too, will vote for the amendment. There is a yardstick in it, but it does not override doctors' rights to prescribe. Doctors who appear to be over-prescribing will be tested by medical audit, not by administrative and financial control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and Cheadle (Mr. Day), who intervened, have supported my argument. I beseech them to join the Opposition in seeking to persuade the Minister that the amendments will improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for being gracious enough to give way twice. I shall try not to be too helpful this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman justified the present system of checking the prescribing habits of doctors. Will he explain why two-and-a-half tonnes of waste medicine were handed back during a three-week campaign in Yorkshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for agreeing that his previous intervention was helpful. There is no dispute between us. There is an element of waste in prescribing. There are also cases of patients not using the drugs that are prescribed, against the best medical advice. A bundle of issues is involved. We do not argue for excessive or wasteful prescribing, far from it. But to put excessive—I underline the word—financial and legislative constraint on doctors is not the right way to tackle the problem. The Bill proposes a system of indicative drug budgets which has not been tested and proved because tests are still going on. The system has not been refined or considered objectively and we are not reassured. It undermines the right that Ministers and Conservative Members say that they wish to preserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of over-prescribing. In many instances, patients do not take the medication that has been prescribed. For example, my mother should take six tablets a day. If they are not put out regularly, she will not take them. At the end of the month there are tablets left over. That is the result not of over-prescribing but of her failure to take them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Some people are nervous about taking too many drugs and medicines and often put their health in danger by not taking their doctor's advice. I have friends and relatives who have done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have let the discussion continue, but there is nothing in the clause that makes it unlawful not to take medicines. Let us return to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made the point that there is more than one reason for not taking drugs; it is not merely a matter of waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago we were having an interesting debate, and the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) was being very honest. We disagree about the need for indicative budgets, and I shall not press the point, but I want to press him on his comment that there is an element of waste. We can all produce anecdotal evidence, which of course is important, but we are discussing general prescribing habits. For example, the percentage of drugs taken by generic brands—they are just as good as proprietary brands, but much cheaper—is only 9 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
in the United Kingdom and 11 per cent. in Italy, while it is 25 per cent. in the United States and 19 per cent. in Japan. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that it is not a small problem? It is a serious problem that both Government and Opposition Members need to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn into a debate on generic prescribing because it is a separate issue. I know that you would call me to order, Mr. McWilliam, if I allowed myself so to be drawn. What the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) says is valid because generic prescribing involves serious issues, but I do not agree that we should necessarily follow the example of what happens in America. The Government are already in difficulty because they are trying to follow the American example on medicines. Look at the mess that they are in. I agree that there are problems, but they do not affect the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doctors have already changed their prescribing practice. There has been a great deal of tightening up, and a sensible dialogue is taking place between doctors, health authorities, academics and NHS administrators about good prescribing practice. That, however, is not what the debate is about; it is about whether the doctor's right to prescribe drugs should be overriding. The amendment does not argue against over-prescribing being checked by medical audit and, where necessary, dealt with. It is a simple requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not wholly follow the exchange that took place between the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). Was the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth saying that he did not approve of generic prescribing in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I said that it was a separate issue and that I should be quickly called to order by you, Mr. McWilliam, as I could see from your demeanour, were I to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. This is a fairly wide debate, but generic substitution is not part of it. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will not go down that road.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go back—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I am slightly worried by what you have just said, because unless we are able to refer to generic substitution it will be difficult to debate indicative drug budgets and what efforts should be made to contain prescribing costs. We need to be able to probe Ministers on generic substitution. That is fundamental to amendment No. 615, which stands in my name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Haynes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). If the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) wants to fudge, that is a matter for him, but the Committee has the right to hear the Opposition's views on generic prescribing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment relates not to generic substitution but to whether financial or other sanctions should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"applied against a practice which exceeds its indicative drug budget".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
As the question of an indicative drug budget is not at issue in any of the amendments, the question of what constitutes an indicative drug budget is not at issue. If hon. Members want to pursue these matters when we come to the question whether the clause should stand part of the Bill, they will be able to do so, but I cannot allow them to do so while the Committee is discussing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It is almost impossible to consider whether a doctor is keeping within his indicative budget if we may not discuss whether he should use generic drugs when in fact he is using brand name drugs, which makes him exceed the buget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: The hon. Gentleman is misunderstanding me, and I hope not deliberately. The question is not whether the doctor exceeds his drug budget but whether there should be sanctions if he does. It is a narrow point but I, too, have to obey Standing Orders.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I come to your support, Mr. McWilliam? As always, you are absolutely right. We cannot have a complete debate on generic substitution, but I am sure that you would not object—just as Dame Janet would not object—if, as an illustration, the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth were briefly to state his views on the subject. It is an important issue. The hon. Gentleman has been asked several times, but he appears to be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fudging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sure not. I am sure that you would not object, Mr. McWilliam, if, in passing, he mentioned his views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: The hon. Gentleman is most persuasive. Of course I would not mind a passing reference. I would, however object to the Committee discussing generic substitution in detail which hon. Members are beginning to do.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. My hon. Friend, the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) made a statement about the level of generic prescribing and I would like to correct his impressions. I am told that 40 per cent. of the 350 million prescriptions are written generically and that they represent about 15 per cent. of the cost of all prescriptions. The percentages are rising quickly owing to the impact of something called PACT —Prescribing Analyses and Cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: The hon. Gentleman is capable of advancing that argument in a contribution to the debate. He has not raised a point of order.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not willing to be drawn into a discussion on generic prescribing because that would fudge the issue and allow Ministers to expand their defence of the indefensible. I shall refer once again to the words used by the Secretary of State in October when he talked about the firm budget for drugs at RHA and FPC level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The management arrangements proposed by the Government will not infringe in any way the right of a general practitioner to prescribe all those medicines which individual patients might need. These points will of course be carried through into our legislative proposals to Parliament."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
That was a promise. Our amendments give the Minister the opportunity to build that promise into the Bill. The Minister for Health said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have pledged and pledged again that every patient will continue to get the drugs they need under this scheme. Even the BMA have accepted our guarantees on this. So what are we going on about?"</p></blockquote>
We are "going on about" getting that guarantee in the Bill in the only place where it counts. If it is not in the Bill, the rights of doctors to prescribe the medicines that are needed will be limited by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments give the Minister for Health a chance to show that she meant what she said earlier and the Secretary of State a chance to keep the promise that I have quoted. I appeal to them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would take away the right of FHSAS to control over-prescribing by doctors, and it would make nonsense of clause 17. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) does not seem to have fully appreciated the serious problem that drug over-prescribing presents. He sounded as if he were putting before us a brief from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, and it surprises me that in a debate about public cost and drug budgets the Labour party should want to support the drug industry rather than consider the public purse and ensure that we get value for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that there was no such brief. My simple aim in tabling the amendments, shared by my hon. Friends, was to ensure that the patient could be confident that his doctor's right to prescribe would not be limited by the administrative and financial arrangements that are set out in the Bill. That and none other, is the point of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that it took the hon. Gentleman 35 minutes to make that simple point. We may need a drug for verbal diarrhoea, if for nothing else, because the point which came across was not that, but that the Labour party opposes any form of budgeting or control of costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why the clause is so important. Two-and-a-half tonnes of waste medicines were handed back in Yorkshire recently after a campaign about the amount of medicine that was being prescribed. When a patient died in Oxfordshire, relatives found three sweet jars containing 4,112 Valium tablets and 807 mogadon tablets. We know that 8 per cent. of all drugs prescribed in Britain are tranquillisers. That demonstrates the scale of the problem. Some GPs are tempted to dole out drugs to get rid of patients who may be a bit of a pest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman accepts that doctors are professional people with a duty of care. Is he saying that there are doctors who deliberately over-prescribe to boost the profits of the pharmaceutical industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am saying that there are lazy doctors, just as there are lazy solicitors, barristers and Members of Parliament. In every profession, there are people whose standards of professionalism are not as high as those of others, and it is certainly true in the medical profession. The statistics show that there are some doctors whose duty of care when it comes to their budgets is not as high as that of many of their colleagues. That is why there can be as much as 100 per cent. difference in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
average drugs bill per patient per year among doctors with similar practices, as the drug prescribing budgets of different doctors show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The campaign which was mounted by the BMA and the Labour party in 1985, when the limited list was introduced, has saved £75 million to date, but there is a problem in getting across to Labour Members the importance of obtaining value for money and ensuring that public money is spent in the best possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is putting only one side of the argument about the limited list. Is he aware that many patients decided to buy their own drugs when the list came in, and that because of the high cost of prescriptions it did not really make any financial difference to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Lady has any evidence to support her contention. If it were true in some instances, it was because some GPs continued to tell their patients that the brand name drugs were better than the generic substitutes. That is not true, however, because this country has a far lower prescription rate on generic drugs than that of other countries. For the United Kingdom, the share in the drugs market of generic drugs is 9 per cent. compared with 11 per cent. for Italy, 19 per cent. for Japan, 21 per cent. for Canada and 25 per cent. for the United States. Those are World Health Organisation figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must realise that we have a long way to go yet before we reach a proper level in prescribing generic drugs as opposed to prescribing brand name drugs which are often twice or three times as expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is using the WHO figures for 1985, which was before the impact of the limited list was felt and before all tranquillisers had to be prescribed generically. They are now all generically written, and there are now 23 million prescriptions a year. The number has increased substantially, and as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), 40 per cent. of all prescriptions are now written generically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The percentage is much lower than that. It is about 15 per cent. I welcome what my hon. Friend has said, however, because it shows the effectiveness already of the limited list in the prescribing of generic drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may wish to reflect on the comment of the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) that the limited list was unnecessary, or words to that effect. In the days before the list, doctors were allowed to prescribe lucozade, which was ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. Hon. Members have a simple choice. If they wish to debate generic substitution they can, but they will then lose the debate on clause stand part. I should explain that hon. Members are in danger of turning this into a clause-stand-part debate. I advise them to keep to the amendments and to make their broader points when we come to consider whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. McWilliam, I am beginning to regret that I mentioned generic drugs en passant. I shall quickly move away from that subject because I always like to keep in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for us to understand the basis of clause 17 and why the amendment is unacceptable. We are trying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
to ensure that prescribing costs are kept under control and that we obtain value for money. Every penny spent on expensive and unnecessary drugs is a penny which cannot be spent on necessary drugs for the patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that the Labour party would get it into its head that in the real world everybody has to budget. We all budget in our personal lives, but when it comes to public money the Labour party says that there is no need to do so. It shows a peculiar sense of values that Labour Members, who I know are extremely careful with their personal finances, believe that when it comes to the state it is as if there were a milch cow in the sky, and when the udder is pulled money will pour out without end. That is not so, and the Labour Government were quite careful about budgets in the NHS. They had to be, because they did not have the money to allow them to be otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is rightly concerned about the amount of money which is spent on drugs, and I am sure that he is concerned also about the information that is disseminated about drugs. We would all like people not to be drug dependent. Therefore, will the hon. Gentleman explain why the Government, who have been in power for 10 years, spend only about £4 to every £50 that the drug companies spend on providing information about drugs? The answer is in the Government's hands. Health education and the spending of more money would achieve all the hon. Gentleman's objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Lady, because it is the GPs who decide which drugs to use. Salesmen from the drug companies come to their surgeries, and I have enough confidence in the professionalism of the vast majority of GPs' to believe that they are not fooled by the spending which the hon. Lady has described. Therefore, it would be wrong for the Government to invest large sums in telling people about the effect of drugs. Doctors have a publication called "Mims" which gives them accurate information on what drugs are meant to do, and I am confident that most doctors are not misled by the blandishments of the drug salesmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to ensure that we get value for money, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will assure the Committee, as the White Paper does and my right hon. and Learned Friend the Secretary of State did on Second Reading, that if there is an epidemic or a need for more money to be spent by a surgery because of particular problems, the necessary money will be made available. The FHSAs will be able to give more money to certain doctors and certain practices if they can show, through a clinical audit carried out by their peers, that additional money is needed. It is nonsense to claim that there will be cash limits and that doctors will not be able to prescribe necessary drugs to their patients. I wish that in debates about matters where money is concerned, the Labour party would stop pretending that there is no need to control costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just described a cash limit. The amendments, far from proposing freedom, merely propose accountability after the event. They seek not to impose a restraint on the doctor before the event, when he is prescribing the drugs or medicines that he knows that his patient needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Accountability will obtain not before the money is spent, but afterwards. If the doctor can demonstrate that it was necessary to spend more money, more money will be provided to top up his budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should try to discover exactly what is meant by a cash limit. How can what paragraph 7.19 of the White Paper describes as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a process of peer review"</p></blockquote>
be described as a cash limit? It cannot, and my hon. Friend should develop that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to develop it much further, because I thought it was as plain as a pikestaff. It is exactly what clause 17 is about, although it is clearly difficult to get that through to Opposition Members. Let us see what the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible that we may have a Scottish debate this afternoon, and I wonder whether this is an attempt to ensure that the Minister for Health does not reply, or whether the Government are worried about whether we shall reach the Scottish amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) to clarify what he has just said. He said that if more money is needed, it will be made available. On what basis does he make what sounds like a commitment which, so far, has not been made by Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then hon. Gentleman should look at clause 17. A peer review is to be introduced, and if doctors can show good reasons for more money—for example, influenza epidemics or special circumstances affecting patients—they will get more money. There is no cash limiting per se in the Bill. An indicative budget is what it says: if indicates the correct level of prescribing for a practice, given the number of patients and the health problems in the area. An enormous amount of information is available about particular problems in different areas. We know, for example, that in the south Wales valleys there are problems associated with cardiac illness and smoking which are not as prevalent in rural practices. Practices in such areas will get more money, because indicative budgets will be based on their present prescribing practices. That is not a cash limit. But ultimately, a doctor will have to account for over-prescribing if he is out of line with the budgets that have been indicated. He will have to account to his peers for his prescribing practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the hon. Member for Monklands, West object? Why is it unreasonable to have a peer review of doctors' prescribing practices? What is wrong with doctors who are in a position to make such judgments asking questions of doctors who are over-prescribing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I challenge the hon. Gentleman to quote one line of clause 17 that can justify the description that he has just given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should read the whole clause, together with the White Paper, and he will see that—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Pembroke should not follow the hon. Member for Monklands, West

	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
(Mr. Clarke) too far down that road. We are getting dangerously close to a debate on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. This is a very narrow amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will come back to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if you tell us at this stage whether you prefer us to have a clause stand part debate on these narrow amendments now or later. It is a matter of some importance. The first group of amendments to a number of the clauses that we have already debated has provided what has been in effect a clause stand part debate, and the clause stand part question has been taken on the nod. We shall welcome your guidance on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: I have no right to a preference in the matter. Standing Orders are clear: they state that the Chair should not allow a clause-stand-part debate if the substance of the clause has been adequately covered by the debate on the amendments. These are narrow amendments which do not cover the clause by any interpretation. Hon. Members should contribute to the clause-stand-part debate, when it takes place, if they wish broadly to discuss the clause, and confine themselves to the amendments during this debate. I shall be happy to grant a clause-stand-part debate if hon. Members will obey that stricture. If they insist on discussing the clause during the debate on the amendments, I warn them that they are in danger of losing the clause-stand-part debate.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. We must clear the matter up once and for all. I wish to speak on the clause. I am happy now to confine myself to sanctions and not to expand on other provisions in the clause, but I shall be disappointed if you rule subsequently, Mr. McWilliam, that there is to be no clause-stand-part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: I shall make it clear: there is nothing in the amendments grouped under clause 17 which would prevent a clause-stand-part debate. It is what hon. Members seem to be up to now that will put the debate in jeopardy. If hon. Gentlemen confine themselves to the amendments and then seek to advance their arguments on clause-stand-part, there is no danger of my not granting a clause-stand-part debate. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) was not listening to me. The amendments are narrow and I ask hon. Members to confine themselves to them.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I hope that you are not suggesting that you intend to be stricter in keeping subsequent speakers in the debate to order than you were with the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). That would place other hon. Members in an invidious and disadvantaged position, because the hon. Gentleman took a wide view of the scope of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall not take different views of the breadth of hon. Members' speeches in this debate. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) was in order in his speech on the amendments. The hon. Gentleman was out of order only when others introduced extraneous matters, such as limited list providing. The hon. Gentleman did not do that. I caution hon. Members to confine themselves to the issues before
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
the Committee. I am surprised that experienced hon. Members do not understand the Standing Orders under which we operate and my strictures. I am trying to be as fair and as relaxed as I can. I merely point out the dangers to hon. Members if they want to raise other issues later and they choose to stray from the amendments now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. I shall take your strictures to heart, Mr. McWilliam. Opposition Members should read the Bill in toto, especially clauses 17 and 18. They should also read working paper 4, "Indicative Prescribing Budgets for General Medical Practitioners", especially paragraph 4.6, which sets out in detail the practices that will follow from the clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to finish my speech. I am aware of the time constraints and I do not want to speak for as long as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). I am aware of your ruling Mr. McWilliam, and I want to keep in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. As you were at pains to make clear, we are discussing amendments to clause 17 and we must remain within the ambit of those amendments. The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) suggested that clause 17 states that there will be an audit by the peers of a prescribing practice if it runs over budget. If that appears in the clause, I ask for the Committee to be told in what line. It is not there. The Committee is in danger of being misled by the hon. Gentleman unless he clarifies the matter for us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. The hon. Gentleman is doing it now. First, it is not for me to ask any hon. Member to justify his views. Secondly, the issue which the hon. Gentleman has raised does not arise from this group of amendments.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 17(4) and (5), which relate to the powers of the FHSAs and to paragraph 4.6 of working paper 4.1 shall quote from that paragraph and then finish what I was saying on sanctions. The paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the FPC"—</p></blockquote>
it is now the FHSA—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be expected to accept and accommodate reasonable explanations for the variation; for example, movement in-year onto the practice list of a patient or patients in need of unusually expensive drugs or changed clinical needs of one or more existing patients necessitating the prescribing of such drugs. The need to continue to prescribe such drugs for these patients will be taken into account when setting future indicative budgets".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition amendment would mean that the FHSAs had no power to control doctors who over-prescribe, do nothing to bring their prescribing practices within an acceptable range and do not explain what they are doing. There is no reason why the FHSAs, through peer group pressure, should not ask fellow GPs why they are over-prescribing without due cause. The amendment attempts to destroy the purpose of clause 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 seeks to tell GPs how much they should spend on their drug budgets. That is interference with a GP's clinical decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working paper 4, to which the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) referred, is clear. Section 1.2 states that the objective is to place downward pressure on expenditure of drugs. That could not be plainer. I believe that it seeks to cut the drug budget regardless of clinical need. Section 2.2 on page 6 refers to allocations to RHAs and FPCs—now FHSAs. At first they will reflect existing spending but later differences in spending attributable to the weighted capitation formula will be reduced at a manageable rate. Section 2.5 on page 8 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Generally where the current level is higher than the average, the indicative budget will be set somewhere between the two figures … Over time, these procedures will bring downward pressure to bear".</p></blockquote>
That means cutting. There will be sanctions against doctors. Section 6.1 on page 14 explains what can only be described as a bonus scheme for GPs. If doctors cut their drugs budget they will get half the money saved. I want the Minister to confirm that that is so. Section 7.1 clearly threatens the withholding of money from GPs, and section 7.2 refers to action against doctors who go beyond their financial limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I had hoped that Opposition Members would take the opportunity presented by the clause to come out from the dugout in which they have been nervously hiding during the proceedings so far and tell us how they propose to replace the Government's Bill. On this occasion at least, they should acknowledge that there is a real problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I assist the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members will have to make up their minds. They have already complained that we are taking too long. However, I will compromise and give way only once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The removal of the constraint relates only to the cluase and the arrangements described therein. There are already arrangements to deal with a GP who is over-prescribing. The arrangements for the medical audit are separate from those in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. I listened with great attention, though with great disappointment, to the speech by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). He appeared to acknowledge that there was a problem, but his proposal amounted only to the maintenance of the status quo—a thoroughly inadequate response to a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem can be usefully divided into three categories. There is over-prescription, and we have heard some dramatic examples from my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day). Another has been drawn to my attention. When a patient died recently in Oxfordshire, relatives discovered three sweet jars of tablets—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had that one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had that one, have we? It has obviously been drawn to the attention of other Members as well, and rightly so. Over-prescription is undoubtedly a major problem, not only of waste, but of potential damage to patients. My example graphically demonstrates that risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that I will not take any more interventions because—if I may repeat this to the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman)—her own colleague has appealed to us to be brief. She cannot have it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem is the prescribing of placebos. These are compounds with no diagnostic or therapeutic value; they are dangerous for patients, particularly if they become addicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third problem is generic prescription. If doctors are prescribing branded drugs, the cost of which is a multiple of the same compound available in generic form, that is a scandal that we need to act on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have not contensted the third proposition. Therefore they are telling not only the Committee but the nation that we have a problem involving an enormous waste of public money, which can damage the health of patients. They are seeking to vote against the Government's proposals and carry on with the status quo, which contains the very problems that they already acknowledge. If that is not a pathetic response to a perceived national problem, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The human mind has conceived of three sanctions, financial or otherwise, to deal with this problem. The ingenuity of hon. Members may come up with a fourth or fifth. However, three conceivable checks have so far been envisaged anywhere in the world. One would be compulsory generic prescription which would clearly place an enormous straitjacket on a doctor's judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. I am trying to be tolerant but the hon. Gentleman is straying too far from the amendment. If he wishes to make his speech in the clause-stand-part debate, I shall be happy to allow him to do so.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So much for the first check. The second would be the extension of the negative list to which reference has already been made. An enormous apparatus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
of bureaucracy, somewhere presumably in Whitehall, has to second-guess the judgment of doctors in deciding whether every new preparation that is registered should be included in the negative list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third way to solve this problem is to set a cash limit, and this is being imposed in a very flexible way. No doctor will run out of cash when he prescribes a medicine that is necessary for his patient. There will be a real counterpoise to the blandishments and marketing pressures of the pharmaceutical industry, which are considerable, and to the natural inertia of medical men to consider the financial consequences of their prescription behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No criticism is being made of the medical profession, which is concerned with saving lives and curing people. Financial considerations will be secondary and even ignored altogether however, in favour of taking the line of least resistance, unless some effective sanction, "financial or otherwise", exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onus lies on Opposition Members. They agree that the problem exists and they must consider the solutions that have been conceived, including the Government's proposals, or produce something that is even more credible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my colleagues to support the Government's extremely sensible proposals, which place an imaginative and flexible financial constraint on the three evils of over-prescription, placebo prescription and unnecessary branded drug prescription.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address myself to amendment No. 615, which stands in my name. In reply to the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) who has not sat down yet—he is standing and talking to his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of leaving the Room while the hon. Member was speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is courteous of him. I have heard the hon. Member speak on a number of occasions and am always left baffled at the end of his contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, Mr. McWilliam, that hon. Members will take note of your clear ruling. I hope, however, that there will be flexibility when we come to discuss whether the clause, as amended, should stand part of the Bill. Some hon. Members will want to hear responses from the Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do the Government hope to achieve at the end of the day in the light of ministerial statements following the original working papers, the White Paper and the publication of the Bill? My amendment attempts to make the drugs budget part of a broader medical audit and to give it the status of a yardstick rather than the statutory status that the Department of Health proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a shift from the Government's original position. Earlier there were threatening noises about penalising doctors who exceeded budget. The Secretary of State has since shown signs that that is not how he sees the clause. None the less that does not detract from the force of the Labour party's amendment or my own. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) asked tongue in cheek, when a budget was a budget. That legitimate question has to be put to Ministers because it is not clear what they see as an indicative budget or, more importantly, by what mechanisms and procedures they will administrate the system. It is extremely important that the Minister give us more information about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) spoke about prescribing costs and gave percentages of generic
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
prescribing, which led us to points of order and rulings. But there is another set of figures which relates to indicative budgets and which must also be borne in mind. I shall quote from the paper, "The Pharmaceutical Industry and the Nation's Health" published by the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry in November 1988, which makes instructive reading. If we place United Kingdom prescribing costs in an international context, we find that British prescribing costs are lower than those in Japan, Switzerland, West Germany, the United States, France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. We are not the black sheep that the hon. Member for Pembroke suggests. He was slightly misusing the statistical guide that he cited in his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider specific figures. In the United States, citizens receive an average of 16.6 prescriptions per year at a cost of £81. In France, it is 10 prescriptions per year at £52. Each Briton receives 6.5 prescriptions per year at a cost of £32. The problem is not as great as the Government suggests but there is a problem, and on the debate about generics I want to say something about it. If not misinformation, at least inadequate information has informed the debate until now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One must not compare apples with oranges when trying to arrive at answers and comparisons, although one accepts that both are fruit. In those interesting statistics, do the figures for the United States, for example, where medicine is substantially private, compare with only the public sector in the United Kingdom, or do the hon. Gentleman's United Kingdom figures include the private sector? is that so for the other countries that he mentioned, or are we comparing apples with oranges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is fair. Given the difference between the two systems, there is bound to be an element of apples and oranges. I shall try to answer his question, if necessary, in ministerial fashion, by writing to him, which is, I suspect, as close to him as I shall ever get. The proportions of gross national product devoted to medical expenditure by Britain, other countries in western Europe, north America and Japan, are accepted as providing a fair base for comparisons between those countries, so I think that the figures that I have given can be accepted for comparative purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows of my deep interest in aviation, and knows that comparisons between countries often produce misleading figures because they have different bases. International figures that include both public and private sector inputs may not allow a fair comparison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's longstanding interest in aviation and his anxiety about international comparisons. I doff my cap to him, as he is a more experienced globetrotter than I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having put the matter into a fairer international context, I return to the domestic issue. The question asked earlier by the hon. Member for Pembroke showed the confusion in his mind, if not within the Department of Health, and revealed the importance of prescription costs. It is important to compare prescription costs in different regions of Britain. The hon. Gentleman referred to a written answer given on 26 October 1989 by the then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
Minister for Health, who is now at the Home Office, which showed that there were large differences in costs for family practitioner committees. The average costs ranged from £45.94 in north Tyneside to £30.01 in Oxfordshire. The hon. Gentleman asked whether something should be done about the costs, and alluded to the fact that they seemed to be higher in areas of greater social deprivation. I criticise the Government because, indicative budgets deal with the cost problem but make insufficient allowance for need. The Black report, and many other surveys, emphasise housing and sanitation needs. The former Under-Secretary of State, God bless her, was right about the importance of nutrition. The clause fails to give sufficient weight to medical needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman consulted the annual report of the Prescription Pricing authority which provides a helpful, coloured map illustrating the close correlation between spending per head on ingredients and what we would normally accept as an indication of regional deprivation. With reference to prescribing by individual practices, the Prescription Pricing authority provides the bizarre fact that Oxfordshire, which has the lowest spending per head on ingredients, has the highest spending on each prescription. There is a correlation between ingredient costs per head and regional deprivation, and Oxfordshire's prescriptions cost more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the Committee were being televised as the hon. Gentleman's illuminating map might have been taken for a parliamentary test card. The map reinforced the conclusion that I drew from the written answer. It would be interesting to hear the Minister speculate upon the reasons for the differences in prescription costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) about lower input costs but more expensive than average individual items, connects to another key finding of the Black report: that medical expenditure cannot be related only to environmental and social needs. It found that the self-confidence of patients and the way in which they articulate their needs when they discuss their treatment with a GP were important and could not be divorced from the indicative budget cost. The issue is not only economic; it is also social, linguistic and cultural. The hon. Gentleman has informed our debate considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals were better when the White Paper on primary health care was published. It outlined further proposals to monitor drug expenditure by encouraging greater use of generic drugs and the analysis of prescriptions with the help of cost PACT data. Six FPCs were chosen in 1989 from such areas as Leeds, Northumberland and Surrey to pilot the proposals—other FPCs were due to follow this April. One of my central criticisms of the Government is that the sensible strategy outlined in the primary health care White Paper, and the pilot scheme, were abandoned, with the exception of the proposals for trusts and fund holding GPs, in favour of the clause. Therefore, the Department of Health's previous action seems absurd. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views on the status of the scheme outlined in the earlier White Paper. The course proposed in the clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
suggests that a deficiency has been found in the option outlined in the primary health care White Paper which the Government did not identify when it was published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government strongly believe in cost-benefit analysis. In an answer to a parliamentary question in October, the then Minister for Health said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main purpose of indicative prescribing budgets is to encourage more cost-effective prescribing through more critical analysis of prescribing patterns."</p></blockquote>
However budgets are not needed for critical analysis of prescribing patterns. I hope that the Minister will explain the Government's method of analysing the cost-effectiveness of drugs. What emphasis are they giving to cost-benefit analysis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many peptic ulcer cases drugs can be used instead of expensive surgery. How far will indicative drug budgets take account of that? Have the Government estimated the savings that will be made when prescribed drugs are used rather than surgery? Immunisation, by which a disease is prevented rather than cured, is the classic example of cost-benefit analysis. It is broadly accepted throughout the world. It has a clear role to play in advanced western countries such as Britain and in Third world countries languishing in poverty. What account does the indicative drug budget take of immunisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to a parliamentary question last October, the then Minister for Health said of drug budgets:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In consequence I expect cost benefit studies in this area to become more commonplace following the introduction of the scheme and that the results will be disseminated to general medical practitioners to help them to decide what is the most cost-effective form of treatment for each patient."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 October 1989; Vol. 158, c. 	<i>533.</i>]</p></blockquote>
That information should be available to doctors and to those setting the budgets if the indicative budgets are to be accurate and effective. If they are not so available, a stupid situation will develop in which a doctor might decide to save money in the short term, in an attempt to keep within his budget, when that saving could cost the NHS more and lose an opportunity for savings in the longer term. None of that has been fleshed out adequately by the Government, and I hope that they will do so this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transferral of prescribing costs should also be considered. It arises when patients attend clinics regularly. It embraces a wide range of medical problems—for example, diabetes, hypertension, rheumatology, and skin or eye complaints. Prescribing to such patients is supervised and controlled by a consultant, who ought, in theory, to be responsible for the cost of the prescriptions, and for any repeat prescriptions that long-term or sustained treatment may involve. In practice, however, GPs are frequently expected to issue repeat prescriptions for patients whose overall medical care is not in their direct control. The consultant has the overall say, but the goods are handed out by the GP. How will indicative budgets deal with that transferred cost? It arises for four reasons—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Does the hon. Gentleman anticipate our debate on amendment No. 268, which we shall discuss later this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) seems to be entirely within amendment No. 615, which is in this group.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) has made a fair
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0688">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
point, but my comments are relevant to amendment No. 615 because one cannot divorce indicative drug budgets from the transference of prescribing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hospitals do not provide a repeat prescription service. Even if they did, however, many patients would find it less convenient to go there rather than to their local GP each time they needed to repeat a prescription. Consultants are reluctant to prescribe sufficient medication to last until their patient's next appointment. That need not be the case with the GP who has more regular contact with patients. Consultants prefer to transfer the cost of prescribing away from their own budgets. That has not been an issue until now because GPs have not been cash-limited or subject to an indicative budget. A GP who repeats prescriptions for a consultant has not involved the consultant in any of the penalties that might inhere in the scheme. General Practitioners find it impossible to refuse necessary medication to patients when the consultant has refused to issue a prescription. That is the special relationship that develops between the family doctor and the patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that transference of prescribing costs will not go away, so will provision be made in the indicative budgets to exclude those costs? There will be glaring deficiency in the scheme unless account is taken of this important element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is, in many ways, more in keeping with the Government's intentions than is clause 17, so I look forward to the Minister's response to it and the various points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party's case for the amendments may accord with its party-political line and the press releases that it issues from time to time —regardless, it seems, of what happens in Committee— but its case does not accord with the facts or with the proposals that we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) drew attention to Working Paper 4—"Indicative Prescribing Budgets for General Medical Practitioners", and quoted from it somewhat selectively. I plead guilty of the same sin, but I do so only in the interests of time. The working paper's first half-dozen paragraphs give a detailed explanation of how indicative budgets will be compiled and monitored, and how, if they are exceeded, discussions will take place. There will be a peer review. The PACT information system will be used—the paper recognises that information systems need to be improved—and FPC help and guidance will be sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, in paragraph 7.1, under the heading of "Sanctions", the working paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Practices will be expected to keep within their indicative budgets except by agreement with their FPC. Where they fail to do so and where discussion/education/peer review has no effect, it will be open to FPCs to initiate action to take appropriate sanctions, the final outcome"—</p></blockquote>
I emphasise "the final outcome"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of which may be withholding of remuneration from the doctors concerned. Sanctions taken against practices exceeding their indicative budgets are seen as a process of last resort and are not expected to be commonplace."</p></blockquote>
Surely, it must be possible to impose sanctions on isolated GPs—I am sure that they will be isolated—who prescribe excessively, whose prescription costs are out of line with those of their peers, with no apparent justification, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
who ignore the advice and guidance that they are given. The conventional form of sanction within the NHS is, by tradition, the withholding of remuneration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that sanctions already exist? Our intention is to remove the specific sanction within the power of the FPC—to use its present name—because of the danger that fear of losing budget and fear of administrative financial sanctions—not the sanctions of peer audit or medical audit—will result in doctors not prescribing what they believe is in the best interests of their patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the passages that I quoted made it clear that that sanction is to be one of last resort. Ultimately, there must be some means—as exist elsewhere in the Health Service—of dealing with doctors who fail to carry out their duties in the appropriate manner, and the final sanction is that of withholding remuneration. It is entirely reasonable for that sanction to apply here, as a last resort, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will resist the amendments and allow the sanction to remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a misdirection, a wasted opportunity, in clause 17, and if the Government took a different tack we should follow them. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) about the report on primary health in England because it is a benchmark, a model, a guide to how we should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said in our discussions, surprisingly enough, about Sainsbury. In the Prescription Pricing Authority, which happens to be located in my constituency, we have a model of administration that is far superior to anything that can be demonstrated by Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury. If our prescription pricing system had the shoplifting rate, the vanishing rate, of the shelves in a supermarket, we should be in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the information that has been accumulated by the Prescription Pricing Authority we have a critical resource that is unique. No other country has at its disposal such a large amount of information about prescriptions and prescription patterns across practices and products. If the Government were proposing to use that basis of information there would be no difficulty because the information is unique, precious and underused. If the Government were proposing to modify their practices in that respect, they would have universal support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with the indicative budget system is that it directs attention to the total cost of prescriptions in the practice. Our existing system of pharmaceutical price regulation, which is underused, is targeted at the over-prescribing of particular products, but it is much more relevant at the level of patient care than is some notional cost, based on information that is much more tenuous, of what the practice should spend on the total number of its patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information that we have about prescribing patterns of individual practices suggests that under-prescribing is as big a problem as, if not bigger than, over-prescribing. In Newcastle, we have an average ingredient cost per head of £10.15, according to the latest figures—that is the average per practice—but one practice has an ingredient cost of £2.94 per head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I am not on its list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. But the system that the Government propose draws our eyes away from the over-prescribing of products and from all the opportunities that new preventive products can offer. How does hormone replacement therapy fit into that system, and how will the Minister for Health use the indicative pricing budget system to promote its use? We shall forgo wonderful new opportunities if our eyes are fixed on the total practice cost of ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is a basic dishonesty about our debate this morning, because it is quite clear—I hope that the Minister will not deny it—that there will be cash limits on prescribing costs at regional level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nowhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps she will explain, then, how the system will be worked out and how there will be indicative cost budgets across regions, FPC areas or whatever replaces them and at individual practice budget level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key institution which manages pharmaceutical price regulation at practice level is the regional medical officer service. Perhaps the Minister can tell us now—she need not be coy about it—what her proposals are for that service, because I understand that the Government are to abolish it, and, therefore, a mechanism that is doing good work on prescribing costs at product level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that they are concerned about budgets. I have here a record of the investigations made by the regional medical officer service into the prescribing practices relating to particular products in each year. In 1979—a memorable year in which one or two significant events occurred—there were 728 such investigations. The number dropped continually until 1984, when they bottomed at 177. Therefore, if there is concern about overprescribing of particular products at practice level, this Government's record is lamentable. It has taken them until this year to build the figures back up again to where they were in 1979, and now the proposal is to abolish the regional medical service, which has delivered already on product controls at individual practice level.

Therefore, there is a basic dishonesty about the Government's proposals, and by not using the information from the Prescription Pricing Authority, they have lost an opportunity. There is now a war of words about costs, which will completely distort the debate that there ought to be at GP practice level about the opportunities for good prescribing and for extending the prescription of treatments such as HRT, with all the good preventative consequences which that can have. We must not be distracted by the accountancy criterion of simply looking at the overall cost per head in individual practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate despite the narrowness of the amendments, and I sense that there is consensus on some points. First, no hon. Member would argue that medical practice can be carried out regardless of cost. Secondly, we all accept that there is an element of waste in prescriptions. I doubt whether that is permanently eradicable—the issue is how it should be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) that the costs of particular practices and the level at which drugs are prescribed should be examined. However, that would be much better done by the GP in the context of an overall budget for his patients and their drug care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
Finally, I think that we all agree on the importance of medical audit, which is perhaps not germane to the amendments. However, we do not agree about one or two basic philosophical points, and that underlines our disagreements about the amendments. First, many Opposition Members seem to believe that virtue can be exercised in a vacuum and in an Utopia where people can be expected to behave without any mention of sanctions, and everyone is good by nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a caricature in our discussion of cash limits—the sanctions we might impose. When we use those phrases, people think there is something vicious about them and that something nasty is bound to happen. I worked in the Civil Service and never saw any Permanent Secretary or accounting officer, faced with an overrun on a cash limit, throw himself out of the window. The worst that such people could possibly look forward to was an uncomfortable quarter of an hour before the PAC and the hon. Member for Workington, bad as that might have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the cash limits provide a framework for the operation of the practice. I do not want to be romantic about it. No one, whether a business man or a doctor, enjoys budgeting, but a welcome element in budgeting is that it provides a framework or sense of where people are going, and gives coherence to what they are doing and how they are planning to do it. There is also a yardstick for measuring comparative performance against other practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, responsible people in any walk of life, particularly GPs, are well aware that contingencies may arise, such as the individual, very expensive patient whom they wish to treat, the new therapy or the epidemic. Assurances are being given in the legislation for those situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides an enabling framework. It is not necessary to incorporate further assurances into the text of the Bill, and I do not agree with the Opposition on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been most helpful in contributing to the debate. The only four elements of a GP's funds that are cash limited cover about 7 per cent. of family practitioner services expenditure. These are practice staff—from 1 April 1990—expenditure on the cost rent scheme and the improvement grant scheme—the computer expenses and the management allowance to fund holders. Only the first three related to all GPs and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has said, they amount to a very small proportion of the total expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for that elucidation. There is only a narrow margin of concern. I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) in relation to the pass-the-parcel exercise in which costs are transferred across to another prescribing organisation. No doubt my hon. Friend will comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens if, once a GP has the indicative budget for his practice, he overspends it? The first line of sanction is that the FPC will offer professional advice, not administrative advice. The second line of sanction is that, if it is felt to be necessary, the FPC or FHSA will have a review of the prescribing practices. Any GP who can demonstrate good clinical reasons whether for an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0690">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
individual group of patients with particular needs, or for a set of circumstances like an epidemic, can then justify those practices. Where that clinical review has taken place and there is no apparent medical justification for the disparity in prescription, and that continues persistently, then and only then would sanctions, administrative or cash, be imposed, and rightly so. There is no point in having a toothless tiger, even if one does not set out to assault everyone who crosses one's path. The sanction would apply only in the final analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant, and consistent with what the Government are rightly trying to do, that the final stage should be sanctions against the doctor, not against his patients. Doctors would do well to realise that they let down not only their patients but the rest of the Health Service if they incur unnecessary costs and use up resources that are urgently needed elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I question the extent of overprescribing. I had ulcerative colitis in the early 1980s and was prescribed an expensive drug called saluzopyrene. I am sure that the GP, when prescribing the drug, worked out how much of it was required to keep my condition stable. But I learnt when taking the drug that it had side-effects, which emerged in Committee on the Competition Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I decided that for the sake of my parliamentary duties it would be best if I took as little of the drug as possible. I say to the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), who referred to valium bottles and mogadon lying around, that if I had died, someone entering my home would have seen bottles full of saluzopyrene. Someone might have accused my GP of over-prescribing, but it was my decision not to take the prescribed amount of drugs, not his. My GP should not be accused of over-prescribing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the same now. I have a condition in my back called ankylosing spondylitis, for which I am prescribed a very expensive drug called naproxen. I admit that I have bottles full of naproxen. I am required to take three pills a day. Last month I took one. Who over-prescribed? The doctor believed that I should take three pills a day and did not know when he prescribed the drug that I would read a newspaper article alerting me to its dangers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had to choose between the danger of taking naproxen and the pain that ensued if I did not take it. I judged that I should not follow the doctor's instructions, and I decided not to take the drug. If I dropped dead tomorrow, someone could enter my home and say that my doctor had over-prescribed naproxen for me. That is not over-prescribing. It is my decision whether to follow a GP's advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be millions of people in the country who feel the same as I do. They accept a drug, accept the instructions and later decide to reduce the dosage. I say not that there is no over-prescribing, but that it has been grossly exaggerated, because no account is taken of other considerations. For me they were the effect of saluzopyrene when carrying out my parliamentary duties, and the effect of taking concentrated doses of naproxen over a number of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They may not be used before the drugs reach the end of their useful life.
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
Do Conservative Members believe that parents should not be allowed to hold large stocks of drugs for that purpose? Do they believe that they should have to go to their child's doctor for a prescription every time a fresh supply is needed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause is nonsense; for example, my currentcondition—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's personal account is not relevant to this morning's example of bottles of unused mogadon being found in the home of a deceased patient. Mogadon is not a therapeutic drug, nor is it an analgesic like naproxen. It is a barbiturate, and large amounts of it should not be prescribed in advance. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman suffers from the ailment that he described, but his anecdote is not relevant to the issue raised earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is. I am glad that the drugs were found unused in the patient's home. It is better for a patient not to take drugs if he or she feels that they will cause unnecessary misery. A patient makes a subscription to the National Health Service; the medical practitioner advises and prescribes medicines. It is the patient's choice whether to take them. The patient may have been prescribed valium but have been fighting it for years, because everyone says that he should not take it. People should be congratulated for resisting valium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The patient should have resisted asking the doctor for valium. it is a waste of money for a patient to have 4,000 valium pills.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should discuss that with people who take valium. Many are not in a position to make that judgment: that is why it is prescribed. The hon. Member for Pembroke does not understand, and he is being grossly insensitive to those who are prescribed the drug. The hon. Gentleman should consider what it is used for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. Does he seriously suggest that it is responsible—or a responsible use of public money —to allow a patient to keep at home several hundred times the lethal dose of barbiturate, as happened in the case described earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the details of that case. I shall not give way again because I understand that my Scottish hon. Friends wish to put their case and they will do so far more eloquently than I. There may have been an abuse in the case quoted: there are isolated examples of abuse. There are pills on the shelves in homes all over the country. That does not necessarily mean that doctors have been over-prescribing. The condition for which the drugs were prescribed may clear up before all the drugs have been taken. Is the patient expected to take the pills back to the medical practitioner? [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes!"] Right, well some people do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that there might be under-prescribing. I have discussed the matter with my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins).
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
Over a period of years, the indicative budget may be used to discipline GPs. All sorts of cost restraints can be imposed by the state, and some way will be found to exercise control over GPs' budgets. Comparisons might be made within an area, as my hon. Friend said. A GP might be told, "One GP can prescribe at this level per patient, and another at that level, so why can't you do it at the lower rate?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
GPs will thuis err on the side of caution and under-prescribe. The patient will suffer medically and financially, because every prescription costs money, unless, like me, a patient has a free-prescription card. Is it fair that such control should be exercised over a GP? It might make him believe that he must reduce his prescribing. If people are forced to go to their doctor for more prescriptions, they may simply not turn up. They will say, "I can't afford it", so they will not be treated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some agreement in the Committee. I shall not go over old ground, but even the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) referred to an element of over-prescribing. It is ironic that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) should have devoted most of his speech to claiming that there was no over-prescribing. In our sitting on 30 January he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister said that no breaches of the rules have been reported to him, but several articles in English newspapers over the years have reported that GPs have been offered inducements, such as equipment for their surgeries, in return for prescribing certain drugs."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If I am right, there is a history of the rules being breached by some GPs. They seem to have found a way round the rules".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 30 January 1990; c. 607.]</p></blockquote>
That is ironic in the light of what he has just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere does clause 17 state that there will be sanctions or financial penalties for exceeding the prescribing limit. The amendment is mere shadow boxing. The Labour party is trying to run a hare that does not exist. I hope when the Minister replies that she will take a leaf out of George Bush's book and say, "Read my lips". Just as he said, "There will be no new taxes", the Minister should say in words that even Opposition Members can understand, "There will be no new sanctions or financial penalties just for exceeding the prescribing budget." If the Minister will say that, we can throw this ball out of court once and for all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that until the Secretary of State gave his assurances, much of our constituency mail on the subject of reforms of the NHS was devoted to the issue that we are debating now. The letters on that subject have ceased. The public seem to have accepted the Minister's assurances. Will my hon. Friend explain why the Opposition have not felt able to accept those assurances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were over-prescribing, it would be nonsensical for the Opposition to believe that there should not be a

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) spoke to amendment No. 615. There is not much difference between his point of view and that of Conservative Members. I suspect that there may be no difference at all, but my hon. Friend the Minister will deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend repeat, in the simplest terms that even Labour Members can understand and will be unable to distort, that the Government accept that doctors should retain total clinical discretion? If she did that, if would end the argument. Nothing in clause 17 will affect a doctor's clinical discretion in any way. Our point is simply that doctors should think about the cost of medicines. Is that so unreasonable? We are not laying down what doctors should prescribe. If, however, two drugs are equally effective, is not it right that doctors should consider cost, in consultation with their colleagues and FPCs? As the guardians of the public purse, the Government should lay down a benchmark on which doctors can base their clinical judgment when they prescribe. That is all that clause 17 will do, and all that we are asking. So do we really need any of the amendments? Of course we do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to deal with four matters when she responds to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the hon. Lady explain the average prescription rate? As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked, what is the methodology or value behind the average prescription rate? Unless one has an idea of the average list or the average patient, one cannot talk about the average prescription cost. It seems ridiculous to attach any value to the average, because one does not know whether it is good or bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when the Minister responds to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, made about HRT, will she take into account expensive fertility treatment, which women might need from their GPs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the FPC covering Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark has produced a paper, which it plans to implement after the Bill is enacted, stating that the ultimate sanction, if a GP exceeds the indicative drug budget, is to withhold remuneration. Will the Minister say whether it was right to have done that? Is it right that the pay of a GP in my constituency should be docked if that GP exceeds the drug budget? If not, what will the Minister do about all the FPCs that plan to withhold remuneration from GPs for exceeding the indicative drug budget?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly—this is a genuine inquiry—will the hon. Lady explain how that fits in with the pharmaceutical price regulations scheme? If that scheme guarantees the profits of the pharmaceutical industry, as it does, how can any saving at patient level, which might cause much damage to patients, assist the public purse when there is that overall safety net for the industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine myself to the amendments, as we are to have a clause-stand-part debate. First, I wish to draw the Committee's attention to the interest which I declared at the start of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 17, there is a presumption that doctors are generally and widely over-prescribing and prescribing inappropriately. I am not certain that that is true. We heard this morning about medicine hoards. I am told reliably that analysis of figures for the poisoning of children by medicines, which is a problem associated with medicine hoarding, shows that 80 per cent. of deaths and injuries that result from that are caused by over-the-counter products, which are not subject to prescription.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister already has a suitable mechanism for sanctioning under regulation 16. In an excellent written answer on 19 January to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Greenway), she stated that regulation 16 already gives the Secretary of State power to refer to the local medical committee any cases of over-prescription—interestingly, there seems to have been no such referral since 1974—and that the Department is currently examining ways in which regulations can be meshed in with the new legislation. However, she added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"GPs who exceed their indicative prescribing budget will not face sanctions on that fact alone. Only where there is clear evidence of excessive prescribing will the FPC refer the matter for consideration by a professional committee. We expect that the application of sanctions will be a process of last resort."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 January 1990; Vol. 165, c. 	<i>457.</i>]</p></blockquote>
I reinforce what my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) said. It is clear that the Department wishes to make sanctioning an act of last resort, and that it already has powers to make sanctions. I presume that the amendments do not seek to take away those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, under regulation 20, the Minister has powers to deal with doctors who prescribe inappropriately, but over the past year and a half there have been few cases where sanctions have had to be imposed. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked two very good and probing questions on the matter a couple of weeks ago, and it is clear that there is not general over-prescribing or inappropriate prescribing. If such prescribing were to take place, my hon. Friend the Minister would have powers under regulations set in 1974 to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made of the fact that we are at the outset of the construction of the PACT—prescribing analyses and cost—system for examining the ways in which practices prescribe. I believe that the excellent information that that will provide—I have seen copies of PACT sheets which are sent to doctors—will be a great factor in keeping doctors to proper prescribing. It is appropriate that FHSAs will rely heavily on the PACT system to take account of the prescribing habits of practices rather than seek to impose what might be arbitrary sanctions upon doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that consultation between FSHAs and doctors will be after the event rather than before it. The White Paper suggests that indicative budgets would be subject to consultation between FPCs—FHSAs, as they have now become—and practices; the Bill provides only that FHSAs shall notify each GP practice of its indicative budget. There is a difference between the two, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell me whether indicative budgets will be the subject of consultation between FHSAs and doctors, before the event rather than only after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) said, the Bill makes no mention of sanctions. Sanctions already exist under the 1974 regulations, and Opposition Members do not seek to alter them. Opposition Members have put up a canard which I am sure that we can knock out of the sky before 1 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The general principles of our objections have already been made clear, but I wish to ask one specific question to which I hope that the Minister will be able to respond. It concerns the proposed move to the weighted capitation formula, on which I should welcome more information. The criteria for the formula include age and sex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty, perhaps because I am chairing only part of the Committee's proceedings, in relating the hon. Gentleman's comments to indicative drug budgets. The hon. Gentleman is talking about a capitation formula. Perhaps he could raise the subject in the debate on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. McWilliam. I thought that the formula related to our worries, as expressed in amendment No. 13, about sanctions. I am worried about the way in which the formula will affect GPs and the way in which the Bill's wider provisions affecting GPs may cause patients to leave practices to which they have belonged for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. The hon. Gentleman is far too wide of the amendment. He will be able to make his comments in the clause-stand-part debate. I repeat that the amendment is about indicative drug budgets. It has been difficult to keep hon. Members on the subject, and I suggest that the hon. Gentleman makes his comments in the clause-stand-part debate, not this debate.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was invited by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) to give a clear commitment, and I shall do so. There will be no new sanction or financial penalty simply for exceeding the indicative prescribing budget, and no power to do so is being sought in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something else that I want to make clear: there is no question of patients not receiving the medicines that they need. That has been said time and again. It was said in the White Paper, it was said at great length by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, and I am sure that all members of the Committee will be aware of the joint statement that was issued by the British Medical Association and the Secretary of State in which the BMA made clear its acceptance of my right hon. and learned Friend's assurances on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, there is no question of any interference with GPs' terms of service. According to the GPs' terms of service, as laid down in 1974, a GP is required to prescribe any drug or appliance that is needed for a patient being treated by him under the NHS. So the position is clear and straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify the thinking behind the clause, with particular regard to the amendments. Hon. Members have given examples of variable prescribing practice. There are large discrepancies. It is not only the 4,112 valium tablets. The regional medical officers to which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) paid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
tribute, have done excellent work in collecting much of the information on the basis of the PPA, which has its headquarters in Newcastle. We have seen in recent years a great increase in the commitment of all involved in prescribing to acquire the necessary information and to refine and improve prescribing practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is far greater agreement on the subject than our discussions this morning suggest. Clearly there will be under-prescribing. The example from Oxfordshire given by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central was interesting. Sometimes the best prescribing is restrained prescribing of high-cost items. Low-cost prescribing is not necessarily the right way. There are some new drugs which if applied at the right time can achieve the best results. It is simplistic to think that prescribing is anything other than a subtle, complex and frequently changing subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The indicative drug budget is a management tool and a way of monitoring precisely what is happening. If a general practice spends on each patient an average of £34 per quarter, one should ask questions. It is not just that multiplied through the practice that will cost £750,000 per year. If one studies the information, one finds that in that practice one in 10 receives anti-ulcer preparations, one in six cough medicines and one in three pain-killers. Lorazepam is a valuable drug when used appropriately. But, given the long-term effects, it is worrying to see that the rate at which it is prescribed is twice as high in some parts of Yorkshire as in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have referred to dump campaigns. In Derbyshire in 1989, 400 lbs of drugs were dumped. In south Staffordshire there was one tonne of unwanted tablets and liquids. In south Glamorgan there were two tonnes of unwanted medicines with an estimated value of £250,000. I hope that hon. Members will accept that we are worried about the effect on patients as much as the effect on resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is advancing a powerful argument, with which we all agree, for the need to examine prescribing practices in relation to individual products. That is different from a system of overall price budgets for all pharmaceutical products, which involves different techniques and has different consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The indicative drug budget is a valuable monitoring tool. It will be a subject for discussion between the family health services authority and its medical adviser. Points have been made about the role of regional medical officers. We hope that the family health services authorities will all have their own independent adviser working with local family practitioners, improving standards and ensuring that the practice is running well and that prescribing is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The indicative drug budget will comprise the existing level of prescribing and take into account demographic changes and changes in pharmaceutical practice. Perhaps a new GP with a special interest in one area of pharmaceuticals or prescribing will join the practice. Perhaps a sheltered home for the disabled will be established in the vicinity. Flexibility will be built in. But I say unequivocally that there will be no cash limit on the drug budget for the family practitioner services. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary made it clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
that only four elements of the family practitioner services are cash limited, accounting for only 7 per cent. of the amount spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making great play of the fact that there will be no cash limits. Why introduce the clause, or the Bill, if there is no threat? Will the Minister assure the Committee that there will be no cash limits this year, next year, the year after or the year after that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to rule out the option to use sanctions if a practice has exceeded its budget. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) said the power to take action against doctors who prescribe excessively is in regulation 16 of the 1974 regulations. There is no new sanction in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that the powers in the Bill already exist. The question remains: why introduce the Bill? Something will emerge from the Bill, within the general framework—not this year, but next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say it again: there are no new sanctions. Sanctions under regulation 16, to which the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay) referred, are rarely used. They have been used in England, not for excessive prescribing but for the inappropriate prescribing of toiletries and food. I believe that the measure was used for excessive prescribing in Wales, but only once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing with the general medical services committee how we can ensure that a hearing takes place in an appropriate setting. It should be a professional hearing because excessive prescribing is a matter for clinical judgment. Many hon. Members have referred to cases in which doctors may have been over-prescribing. My view is that it is a clinical subject and professionals should take the decisions. They will find on the facts whether there has been excessive prescribing, and recommend a penalty, which will be referred to the FHSA. The practitioner involved will have the right of appeal to the RHA. I hope that that makes the position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that there is the possibility of imposing a sanction. For the indicative budgets, it is a benchmark, a monitoring tool and a way of ensuring good practice. It will highlight practices which need extra attention.

We agree that pharmaceuticals are a major force for good. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham will be reassured that the industry has played an important part in promoting health and preventing disease. We want to ensure that resources are used in the Health Service for high-quality patient care. At general practitioner, gate-keeper level, every possible step will be taken to ensure that good practice is maintained and bad practice eliminated. The powers are already in place.

The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) referred to the initiative for promoting better health. We have made excellent progress. We hope to build into our guidance the lessons learnt from the six family practitioner committees. There have been a number of initiatives, including the limited list and the development of PACT. The indicative drug budget is a useful extra tool. There are no new sanctions and patients will receive the drugs that they need. I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
