	<p>[MR. PATRICK CORMACK 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>FINANCE BILL</h1></div>
	<p>(Except clauses 3, 9, 10 to 20, 23, 25 and 68)</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister to move the sittings motion, I have some announcements to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who served on last year's Committee will remember the difficulties that we experienced in the heat when we moved to a small and crowded room. I took extensive soundings during the past few weeks, and the general consensus was that it would be better to conduct our proceedings in this Room. That is not a totally satisfactory answer, but any alternative would be worse. There are extra desks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are extra desks from last year. I thank the staff who organised the Room. Despite last year's announcement, the traditional green boxes are available. I hope that hon. Members will take one and use them for their Committee papers. This may be the last year that they are provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word about Divisions. When a Division is called in this Committee, it appears on the annunciator. That does not happen in other Committees. I shall allow a maximum of four minutes for the Division after the announcement has appeared on the annunciator. If all hon. Members are present before four minutes have passed, we shall take the Division. As for the dinner break, I shall generally suspend the sitting at about 7 o'clock, or at some convenient time thereafter, for 90 minutes. If there is a Division in the Chamber, 15 minutes will be added to the break for each one, If Divisions are called while the Committee is sitting, I shall suspend proceedings for 15 minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Copies of the Ways and Means resolutions, on which the Bill is founded, are on the Table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adequate notice of amendments must be given. I shall only select manuscripts or starred amendments in exceptional circumstances. Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 do not appear on today's selection list for that reason. Green pads are available to all hon. Members and in the Public Bill Office for the tabling of amendments. The printers have asked me to request hon. Members to submit their amendments of those forms. That is not obligatory, but it will help the printers and may prevent the errors that sometimes appear on Order Papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general rule, I shall chair the Committee on Tuesdays and Mr. Coleman will do so on Thursdays. Mr. Coleman is not available this evening and, therefore, I shall take the Chair for the first hour and Mr. Leadbitter will chair the rest of today's sitting. I am grateful to him for doing so. I hope that all that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. I wish to raise the question of the venue. Although you claim that wide consultation took place, I was surprised at your announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may recall, Mr. Cormack, that last year was the first in which the Finance Bill Standing Committee moved down to this Room, largely as a result of inquiries that you instituted into the difficulties of occupying Room 10 for the first, not the second, part of Thursday evening—before dinner. For a few weeks we sat here, at the end of which Committee Members raised this matter with the Chairman. The unanimous view was that the experiment of conducting the Committee here had been a failure. I am strongly of that view myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Benches opposite are not as crowded as those on our side. They could not possibly be so. It is extremely uncomfortable and generally overcrowded in this Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall deal with that matter immediately. Extensive consultations took place. I wrote to both the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the shadow Chancellor who in turn consulted the Treasury and the Opposition Treasury team. I wrote to each party's Chief Whip and was informed—in writing by all of them—that this was the best location for the Committee. That is why we are here. [Several hon. Members rose—] I cannot take any more points of order about that. The position is as I have stated. Consultation took place. I cannot write to every Committee Member because I do not know who will be sitting on it. That is the end of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a related point of Order, Mr. Cormack. Could we not relieve the position on these Benches by putting a third row of tables by the window, where there would be room for them? Could we not consider that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why not. We could make such arrangements for the next sitting. That should meet the vociferous opposition of hon. Members who rose to make a point of Order. We now come to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Finance Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
May I say how pleased we are once again to debate the Finance Bill under your chairmanship, Mr. Cormack. We are grateful for your presiding over our proceedings so firmly and fairly in previous years. We look forward to the same again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this side of the Committee the cast is much the same as in previous years. Looking at the party opposite, with a few exceptions—notably the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), whom I welcome to the Committee—the same is true. We are bound to consider the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell). I am grateful to you, Mr. Cormack, for responding to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I follow the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in welcoming you, Mr. Cormack, to the Chair.

In the previous year, my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) observed that this is a very important Committee, on which there is much competition to serve. That has been true again this year at least on our side of the Committee. We have had more hon. Members wishing to serve than we could accommodate. I understand that that has also been true on the Government side—a tribute to both interest in the Committee and to your helpful and wise chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially pleased to be on this Committee. It is many years since I served on a Finance Bill Committee. Indeed, it is so many years ago that on that occasion the Shadow Chief secretary's first name was also Margaret. Moreover, on that occasion I was snatched untimely from the considerations of that Committee into the Government Whips Office, I do not anticipate that that fate will befall me this time, and hope to have the privilege of serving through a full Finance Bill. With your guidance, Mr. Cormack, and with help from the learned Clerk, I am sure that it will be good humoured and constructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I commend that to the Whips expecially to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) because he has to catch a train north.

I support the sittings motion. However, I hope that it will prove adequate, if, following our discussions over the next few days, new clauses are tabled with modifications to the poll tax.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can have a short debate on clause 1 and that the Economic Secretary will be able to enlighten us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem with the Scottish whisky industry. Exports of whisky are high and, therefore the industry is important in view of Britain's present catastrophic balance of payments. It would be right to spend time on this clause and ensure that the whisky industry will not suffer as a result of the proposed changes. It would not be right to mention the Scottish whisky industry without regard to the other effects that it may have on people such as the health effects. I am ever mindful of the problem that drinking alcohol can become an addictive habit and the Committee would not wish to encourage that, but I wish to dwell on the 10 per cent. increase on spirits, the increase on beer and wine was only 7 per cent. What was the rationale behind adding a further 3 per cent. on spirits? I do not say that that increase is wrong nor do I criticise the Government for imposing it. However, I should like to know why the change was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to two other small problems. First, Britain is in the anomalous position of being the only Common Market country to discriminate against home-produce spirits in favour of imported wines and other beverages, such as sherries. The reason is that, unlike most other drinks, whisky is not taxed according to alcohol content. As a result, the unit of alcohol is more expensive than some imports, which consequently have an advantage. An efficient industry seeking to export most of its products ought to receive fair play from the Government. I should like to know if the Economic Secretary has any plans to change the method of taxing spirits so that whisky is not at a disadvantage compared with imported alcoholic drinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, at present the Government do not allow a statutory maturation allowance for stocks of maturing whisky which are distilled within the legal three-year minimum. Such an allowance would help the industry. It might be that it would be too great a help, but other countries look after their equivalent industries a great deal more than we look after ours. The whisky industry has been in a bouyant mood and has experienced no special problems, but that may change. If so, I hope that the Economic Secretary will say whether the Government intend to ensure that our industry enjoys equal treatment with other countries in respect of a maturation allowance, without which the industry would suffer if it went into the doldrums.

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The Opposition do not intend to divide the Committee over clause 1. Increases in valorisation are only to be expected. It is better that such increases are steady than raised in a large jump because a problen has been neglected by the Government for years. At the time of the Budget, the Chancellor clearly believed that inflation would run at about 6 or 7 per cent. Nowadays, it seems that inflation will run at around 10 per cent. or even higher. That means that I cannot really argue that the whisky industry has received unfair treatment, as, the rise in duty seems likely only to match the rise in retail prices. It could even be said that the increases for beer and medium and other wines are smaller than they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put forward three points, and I am sure that the Committee will be interested in what the Economic Secretary has to say in reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise briefly an issue that I have discussed with the chairman of the board of Customs and Excise when he has appeared before the Public Accounts Select Committee. The duties under clause 1 will raise £4·9 billion in the current year, but increasing them requires a specific clause in the Finance Bill. In contrast, value added tax, which is also collected by Customs and Excise, is a bouyant tax whose yield rises as sales rise. I know that this is a difficult issue, but might not the Treasury reconsider the possibility of relating the duty on alcohol to its price? That would remove the very sharp rise in the retail prices index that is produced by an annual increase imposed in the Budget. Of the recent incrase in the RPI, I understand that about one half of 1 per cent. is attributable to this clause and perhaps to the clause that relates to tobacco duties. That substantial increase, which comes about once a year, is due to the Budget. It would be better if the yield could rise gradually over the course of the year. That would happen only if the duty were related to the price and not as it is at present, to the quantity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My first few minutes, experience of serving in this Room confirms my view that it is hopelessly unsuitable for the Committee. I support what the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) had to say. If, Mr. Cormack, you have written to my hon. Friend the Chief Whip and he has replied saying that he thinks that the Room is suitable, I shall have a word with him. It is extremely difficult to hear what other hon. Members say. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded that the first time that I served on a Finance Bill Committee I proposed a valorisation system for excise duties and found myself in contest with the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson). He was then a shadow Opposition spokesman. After all those years no progress has been made on what seems to be an obvious move. Over the years Chancellors and Treasury Ministers have allowed excise duties to fall behind the rate of inflation, so that spirit duties have been substantially reduced. Since 1985 duties on beer and wine have been reduced in real terms every year except 1988, so at some time, some Chancellor is bound to raise them. We can guess why that has been done this year; it is because the Government do not want to raise duties next year. Duties are being uprated now so that the decks are cleared for no increases in a possible election year. I shall be surprised if the Chancellor upratres any duties next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
However, the policy makes no sense, because it has the effect of reducing the real price of alcohol over substantial periods. I understand that it is part of the Government's policy to make the price of alcohol a factor in deterring excess consumption. Evidence shows that if the price of alcohol falls, consumption increases. Therefore, it makes no sense if the real price falls year after year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, that is also an argument against harmonisation towards some levels that prevail in some other Community countries. I have argued in previous years that harmonisation of excise duties is not necessary in achieving a single market. The rate of tax, or duty, is applied uniformly to all products, regardless of their country of origin, at the point of sale. As the amount of cross-border traffic is bound to be less in island countries than in other parts of Europe, it is a relatively small problem for us and our neighbours if our rates are out of line with theirs. I, and others, have had that argument with Lord Cockfield over the years and I place it on the record now. I believe strongly in the creation of the single European market but I do not believe that harmonisation is essential to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, through discussion with other members of the Community, we can arrive at a common view about the role that excise duty should play in policy on alcohol. It is an important issue. The Government have had for some time an inter-ministerial group that studies alcohol problems, yet it seems to have had no influence on the Chancellor last year and a delayed influence this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed at the suggestion that the Opposition might consider voting against this year's valorisation because it was clearly overdue. I wish that there was a system of regular valorisation so that the rate of duty was kept in line with inflation rather than pushed up by irregular increases year by year. That creates difficulty for the trades and industries involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary take this opportunity to make clear the Government's view on harmonisation of duties on wines and spirits?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear what the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) had to say on the matter because just before the general election he and his party were running into difficulties with their draft manifesto, which included putting VAT on children's clothes and reducing duties on wines and spirits. I am glad that he now favours clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary take this opportunity to make it crystal clear whether there is a long-term proposal to bring our duties into line with the EC averages and so to impose duties on printed products and children's clothes, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chancellor and the Treasury receive much advice before the Budget each year. It is unfortunate that they chose to reject the advice of the Scotch Whisky Association and the Wine and Spirit Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which advocated that the duty on spirits should not be increased, certainly not beyond that on beer and medium wines. However, and increase of 10 per cent., as opposed to 7 per cent. for the other two categories, is proposed. That will be detrimental to the Scotch whisky industry in the United Kingdom and especially in Scotland.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Although whisky exports are buoyant and increased by about 14 per cent. last year, the domestic market continues to decline—it declined last year by about 2.5 per cent. We have heard about the move toward the harmonisation of duties, with 1992 in mind. The Scotch Whisky Association is worried about that and the whole wine and spirits industry is worried about the additional costs involved in metrication. It asked for an extension beyond December 1994 for ending the use of imperial measures. The Department of Trade and Industry rejected that request and reiterated that 1994 is the deadline for ending imperial measures. That will mean additional cost for the whole industry. It is unfortuante that the 10 per cent. increase on duties in the Budget will hit the whisky industry and encourage drinkers to consume cheaper imported drinks. Apart from anything else, that will add to inflation worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will Highland Distilleries and Seagram Distilleries, both of which made donations of several thousand pounds to Conservative party funds last year, view this measure as a wise investment and a good return, considering that the advice from them and from their associations were rejected? Although it is rather late in the day, I should like to hear the Economic Secretary's explanation of why a 10 per cent. increase should be applied to whisky. That increase is significantly and damagingly more than that placed on other drinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Richard Ryder)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) said that it was odd that we rejected the advice of the Scotch Whisky Association and increased the duty by 10 per cent. Although it may seem odd to the hon. Gentleman that we rejected that advice, I must tell him as cordially as I can that we accepted the advice of the TUC which asked us to double the rates on whisky. I am sure that, like other Opposition Members, the hon. Gentleman is a member of a trade union. It would assist the Government in succeeding years if Opposition Members could co-ordinate their advice with that of their friends in the TUC. We shall discuss this under clause 2, but the TUC asked us to double the rates on tobacco also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not as forthright in saying why the TUC gave that advice, but I wonder whether it was because of health reasons. The Economic Secretary must remember that the Opposition said that matters such as health need to be taken into account, but now is not the time and place to discuss them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the reasons for the TUC's advice to the Government but I know that they asked us to double the duty on spirits and tobacco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was right to say that there has been a stand still since 1985. He was correct to point out that the price of a bottle of whisky in 1985 at 1989 prices would have been £9.21 and in 1990, after 10 per cent. increase it is only £8.52. Effectively, even though we have increased the rate by 10 per cent., the price of a bottle of whisky has gone down by 70p since 1985. Going back further still, in 1970 the price of a bottle of whisky at 1989 prices would have been £16.83. There has been a gradual reduction in the price of a bottle of whisky over the years. The Government cannot be accused of being
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
too tough on the whisky industry, given our treatment of it during the past 10 years. When we came to office, the figure would have been £9.63.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) who has a distillery in his constituency. I understand why he wants a permanent standstill in duties on whisky: if I represented a constituency in which there was a distillery—more is the pity that I do not—I should advance the same arguments. That response may, in part, satisfy the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed took the Government to task for not doing enough on the ministerial group on alcohol abuse, a Committee chaired formally by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy, then the Lord President of the Council. I sat on that Committee last year. We took action on several matters, and I shall not bore the Committee by reading them out. The Committee received an extremely good press from those who are generally sympathetic to the well known and consistent views of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed on the subject of drinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a mistake for the Committee to get carried away in considering the 10 per cent. increase only in terms of whisky because it applies to gin, vodka and other spirits too. The Scottish whisky industry may make more noise than the other industries but they are no less important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham alluded to our balance of payments difficulty, saying that our decision would not be helpful in that respect. We do not charge the extra 10 per cent. on exports. As 85 per cent. is exported, it makes not the slightest difference to Scottish whisky exports or to those of gin, vodka and so on, which are also high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) and one or two other hon. Gentlemen queried the British Government's position on the setting of excise duties. I said in a previous debate on the subject of petrol, when the hon. Gentleman was present, that we believe that we should retain the right to set our own duty. The Council of Ministers must take a unanimous decision if it is to be changed, so there is no prospect of such a change. I hope that a Labour Government would pursue precisely the same policy—perhaps the hon. Member for Wrexham will confirm that before we conclude this stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham wondered why we discriminated—as he alleged—against whisky and in favour of wine. I do not agree that there is discrimination. The United Kingdom has its own wine industry, but we do not discriminate in favour of whisky or any other spirits and against wine. Neither my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer nor his predecessor discriminated in favour of one over the other. Indeed, examination of the figure without knowing the details might lead one to say that my right hon. Friend the Member of Blaby (Mr. Lawson) over-sympathised with the spirits industry and against the wine industry because he raised duty by 10 per cent. and my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), in a sense, did the reverse. Neither charge is true. The rates have to be looked at by the Chancellor on an annual basis. He has to take account of environmental, employment, health and other factors, relating to spirits and tobacco.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that my hon. Friend's reply to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) was satisfactory. There is no distillery in my constituency although I represent very many consumers of the product. The question is not the Government's undoubtedly excellent record on taxing whisky during this Parliament, but why the duty was increased so sharply this year. I am not sure that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has given a complete answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He quoted in support the Trades Union Congress. I have no objection to that, but he will be aware that the Treasury was advised by Scottish Conservative Members not to impose the increase, so I hope that he will not suggest to the Committee that he will always take the advice of the TUC over that of Scottish Conservative Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is already tempting me into saying things that I should not say. He asked why 10 per cent. rather than 9 per cent. or 11 per cent. How long is a ball of String? As he will be aware, there has been a standstill since 1985. 1 have given figures which show that the price of a bottle of whisky is significantly cheaper than in 1985 even taking account of the increase, and significantly cheaper than in 1979 and each preceding year. If, on the 1989 prices, we used figures from the 1960s and 1970s people would be paying £15, £16 or £17 for a bottle of whisky. No one can claim that either our Government or the previous Labour Government discriminated against the Scottish whisky industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand my hon. Friend's anxiety about the industry's future. Six new distilleries have been opened in recent years, so there is no truth in the assertion that the Scottish whisky industry has declined—far from it. I hope that one reason for the growth in the Scottish whisky industry is that it is exporting more; 85 per cent. of all whisky produced in Scotland is exported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary is known for his expertise in these matters. Can he do anything to assist the British winemaking industry with taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the industry will bear the 10 per cent. increase and no doubt there will be a Scotch whisky industry in years to come despite it. However, there is one important point to consider: if the industry has a good home base, and duty matters, it is that much more difficult for the industry to have a good exporting record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary did not answer my question about the statutory maturation allowance for stocks of whisky maturing or distilled within the legal three-year limit. I cannot expect the Minister to be a fount of all wisdom. If he cannot give a sensible answer to my question about that, perhaps he will at least consider it after the Bill is enacted. It is an important matter. I am sure that the industry will read the record of this debate and, as a result, make appropriate representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue of stock maturation, on which there have been representations, is dealt with not by Customs and Excise but by the Inland Revenue. To that extent, it is permanently mulled over by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. Nevertheless, I wish to respond to the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). As I said, it is the responsibility of the Inland Revenue. Surely a business tax system with a broad base and low rates is the best way to encourage the success of all sectors in industry. No one can
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
doubt that. I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but it would be difficult to single out one sector for favourable treatment and, indeed, that would be unfair on other industries, such as those discussed this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) made a brief intervention about British wine. I understand that British wine bears one the the lowest rates of excise duty in relation to alcoholic strengths. What additional assistance would the hon. Gentleman wish to provide for the English wine industry? If he were responsible for such matters, unless he were careful in what he did, he could contravene some of the decisions about wine already taken in Brussels. I doubt whether it is part of Labour party policy to give special help to the English wine industry, probably for that reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The British wine industry now produces some very high quality wines, although often on a small scale. Perhaps long after we have departed this place and even this earth, the British wine industry will revert to its size of 300 years ago, when climatic conditions were somewhat different. Indeed, with the greenhouse effect, it might happen sooner than we think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those small British wine producers deserve as much support as we can give them. The constraints are set by Brussels rather than us. But mine was a general fishing question to ascertain whether the Treasury had considered the matter. If it would help to table a question or write a letter at a later date, I should be pleased to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind offer. It would be interesting to engage in a written question and answer session with him about English wine, not least because, although I may not have a distillery in my constituency, I have two excellent vineyards— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Indeed, a bottle for lunch and a bottle for dinner! But the hon. Gentleman is right. Although the quality of English wine is beyond doubt, in a sense the cost matches the quality. On average, the cost of a bottle of English wine is slightly higher. That is due to its quality and to the fact that the yield per hectare or per acre from grapes grown in England—at least so far—is lower than in most other European and Mediterranean countries with Mediterranean climates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Gentleman, I wish the English wine industry well. Once the Committee has finished its proceedings, I shall bring the hon. Gentleman two bottles of wine from my constituency and do my best to share them with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consideration of clause 2 gives an opportunity to explore the Government's almost incoherent approach to tobacco taxation.

The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon.

The following year, presumably not in response to representations from the health lobby, he levied no increase in duty. Perhaps, by coincidence, that was because it was general election year. The year after, the former Chancellor increased duty in line with inflation and last year the duty was not increased. We are now considering an increase today. It is almost impossible to work out the Government's motives, apart from the obvious short-term pragmatic one of winning general elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor must bear in mind a range of differing and conflicting considerations. The health arguments are well made and well understood in the House but they are not the only arguments to put to the Chancellor. There are arguments of decreasing strength but, nevertheless, there are important arguments about domestic employment. We have had factory closures in Basildon, Belfast, Carrickfergus, Glasgow, Manchester, my own constituency in Newcastle, Silvertown, Stirling and in Swindon. Those are tobacco manufacturing closures in the United Kingdom but they have not, as many people might have thought, been followed by a dramatic downturn in the consumption of tobacco products. Imported tobacco products are filling the place in the market formerly taken by the products domestically manufactured. The Chancellor has to take into account those trade issues but, more importantly, the Chancellor has to consider health factors and the position of British taxation policy alongside the policy adopted in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has not been possible to draw from the Government an explanation of their approach to harmonisation on tobacco products. The former Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Blaby, thought that a single market could be achieved with a market-based approach; progressive reductions in border controls would create market pressure for the convergence of indirect tax rates. It is difficult to see how that approach alone could work for tobacco, which is
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
easily transported and of high value. If it were possible to pay the duty in one country and sell the products in another, the temptation to do so would be overwhelming. The loss to the British Exchequer would be just over £6 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to hear a coherent response from the Minister to the problems posed by 1992. Will he say whether Customs and Excise intend to adopt a policy of tax stamps to be put inside the cellophane wrapping on cigarette packets, whether there will be a series of bonded warehouses inside the Community so that there is no free market in tobacco, or whether he has other proposals for collecting the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue on which the Government should make their position clear is the request being made in Europe for an all out ban on advertising of tobacco products. Whether that good is outside the debate, but the effect of such a ban on the tobacco market is not. It would help the sale of goods sold as price packs, but would disadvantage advertised and marketed brands, which cost more money but bring in more money to the Exchequer. Experience shows that when there is price competition, the consumer trades down, going for the cheapest product if there is no added value in the advertised goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British tobacco market is fully developed. People are not being told for the first time about cigarettes. The market may have grown during the 1950s in response to advertising, but it does not expand now in response to advertising. People may change products, but they do not consume for the first time because advertising suddenly makes them aware of tobacco. If the market moved towards cheaper price packs, I fear that consumption of tobacco might increase. The House would not view that as desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because such a ban would be to the advantage of some manufacturers and to the disadvantage of others, there will be mixed views about it. For example, given their tobacco estate monopoly, I understand why the French Government might favour an outright ban on advertising. If the British Government's view is that such a ban should be supported, what sort of approach will the Government adopt to pricing in the British market? If prices come down, younger people will be encouraged to start consuming tobacco products; their purchasing power is not elastic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say something about the West Berlin tax regime? I understand the reasons for the regime being put in place, in a different era, but it has proved an enormous, and rational, temptation to the manufacturers of tobacco products. Many of the jobs in the industry that have been lost in this country have been translated into jobs in West Berlin where plant and machinery is amongst the most modern and efficient in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With 100 per cent. grants for purchasing the machinery it is easy to see why. West Berlin enjoys lower rates of VAT than the rest of Germany, so tobacco manufacturers are tempted to go there; in addition they get handsome grants for taking on new employees. The tax regime offers an enormous temptation to any manufacturer and, because of the nature of the industry, is particularly advantageous to the manufacturers of tobacco products. It represents a substantial distortion of what is supposed to be a free market, and encourages the production of price packs and reductions in the price of tobacco products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Whatever may have been the case for the West Berlin tax regime, I cannot see that the case endures. Will the Economic Secretary tell the Committee what representations the British Government are making in Europe, and, in particular to the West German Government, about the continuation of the regime? Finally, how much of the extra revenue that the Minister intends to raise from the increased tax on tobacco products will be spent on health education? If the tobacco market is conditioned by price, as it is, it is also conditioned by awareness of the health issues. Regardless of the Government's attitude to the advertising of tobacco products, they surely have a duty to advertise widely the acknowledged dangers of consuming tobacco products. Are the Government prepared to make such a commitment? It is self-righteous to talk about out and out advertising bans that will be supported by some people in the industry and adamantly opposed by others, if they are not willing to explain the wrongs of consuming tobacco products and make the public, particularly young people, aware of the dangers associated with smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a positive commitment from the Government, not a self-righteous general appeal at European level that pretends to do something without achieving anything significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach is incoherent and the Economic Secretary has some explaining to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. TED LEADBITTER 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the point put by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) will remember that we considered these issues in the Public Accounts Committee when we were studying the prevention of coronary disease, and we found a striking contrast between the amount of money spent on prevention, on the one hand, and cure, on the other. In particular, we noticed what money was spent in drawing to the public's attention the dangers inherent in smoking, a poor diet and lack of exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. If we are to err on one side or the other, I believe that we should increase the price of cigarettes by more rather than less than the rate of inflation—I say that as someone who smokes a small number of cigarettes. There is no doubt that price is the most effective way of curbing demand. All the other measures—bans and so on—fall into insignificance by comparison. Price is an effective method of curbing demand, and I trust that the Treasury will take that fact into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary replied to the point that I made during the previous debate. If not, will he do now because the matter is also relevant to this debate? Revenue under clause 2 will be £5.4 billion this year when the increases have been made but, again, there will be a sharp jump in the retail prices index because of the specific duties. Is there not some way in which to make the yield buoyant so that it rises as the price rises?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it is not so conspicuous in the case of alcohol, it is notable that tobacco prices and duty have not been fully valorised over the years. In some years the real price of tobacco has been allowed to fall. With the increases this year, the Government have gone some way to redress that fall but even if the valorisation which I and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) favour had taken place, some of us would still have argued the case for the Government to go beyond valorisation to discourage by price the consumption of tobacco, and especially the smoking of cigarettes, which it is now obvious poses serious health dangers not only to those who smoke but to those who do not smoke that is all the more reason why the Government should take the matter seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that the Labour party was ready to take up the cudgels in favour of tobacco advertising in such a doughty way as the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not taking up the cudgels on behalf of tobacco advertising and it is naughty of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that I am. I said that the effective conditions of consumption of tobacco products is price rather than advertising, especially in a developed market. It is hypocritical to say that anti-tobacco consumption measures should be advertising bans rather than promulgation of public health information, which I support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: that is exactly what the tobacco advertisers say—that they are advertising only for the market share and that tobacco advertising does not increase consumption or encourage young people to smoke. I remain suspicious of that claim, especially when I see the amount of effort that they deploy on advertising in cinemas which are attended by the young people. Market share is clearly part of the purpose of advertising but, unless I misheard the hon. Gentleman, he seemed to be saying, even in the refinement of his comment, that a ban on tobacco advertising is not an appropriate weapon. I seem to disagree with the Labour party. Limitation of tobacco advertising has a part to play in the process, but price is known to be the most powerful weapon and the Government make more use of it. We argue that there should be double indexed duties on tobacco this year, but the Government's great fear is the retail prices index, from which they have recently suffered bruising wounds. I foresee that this time next year they will not be willing to make an increase that we all consider necessary and appropriate to, at least, valorise the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful if Ministers would make it clear this year that the Government's policy is at least to maintain the real price level, and therefore to valorise. Otherwise, Ministers will be under political pressure next year to massage the retail prices index by not taking that step. It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary would make it clear this year that the Government are locked into the principle of valorising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what the Government are doing—it is right to increase the tax substantially and I hope that they will continue to do so—but I also hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will explain why he is not doing the same with chewing tobacco.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disgusting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, it is disgusting and a health hazard. It leads to diseases of the mouth which put people at great risk and can kill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that chewing tobacco would be another item that would merit the taxman's attentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pray in aid the Trades Union Congress, which seems to be siding with us on the Conservative Benches this afternoon, and shall wear my Manufacturing Science Finance Union, as opposed to an Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs hat. I welcome its support for the doubling of the tax on tobacco. I am especially worried about young smokers, or potential young smokers. Far too many young people, especially girls, smoke. Advertising and certain shopkeepers may play a part in that, but the young person is affected by price above all, so we must increase the price year after year to deter young people from adopting the habit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the argument is that we cannot touch the price because of the effect on inflation, I ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and those who advise on the RPI, to take out that item on good health grounds. Perhaps alcohol could be taken out as well. We could then increase prices and save lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A large number of my constituents work at the John Player factory in Nottingham and I have been heavily lobbied by the chairman of the local Conservative association, who is involved in the small shopkeepers association. He has expressed grave doubts about the Government's policy of increasing tobacco duty. He is a charming man and a very generous loser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Economic Secretary to consider a suggestion that was made to his colleague, the Earl of Caithness, by a delegation of Labour Members, including me and my hon. Friends the Members for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) and for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) when we visited him before the Budget. We all accept the arguments about health—my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) put the arguments for health education clearly—but those employed in the industry would appreciate some consistency. Many of the large tobacco companies are conglomerates and are switched about in the game of Monopoly that takes place among some major British companies. People could be redeployed into other jobs and industries. The tobacco industry is constantly on hot bricks because of the Government's lack of consistency in their policies towards duty. That applies to Governments of all political colours. We need some long-term planning so that redevelopment can take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to make plans, especially when a dire economic situation has been inherited from the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), who did not increase duties, but left
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
that baby in the arms of his successor. None the less, a clearer direction of policy would be welcome, and I hope one will be taken by the next Labour Government as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Diane Abbott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This rise in duty does not go far enough. Cigarettes are a killer—increasingly among women. I have no cigarette factories in my constituency, but there are thousands of young people who smoke. They should not, so I would welcome a higher rate of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) referred to money being spent on health education. In California, as a result of a local referendum, extra duty was put on cigarettes, which was designated to be spent on health education. That extra money funded a famous series of televison and other advertising. I know that the Treasury is against designating a section of revenue for a specific purpose, but if we are serious about fighting cigarette smoking, we must consider health education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) suggested taking cigarettes out of the RPI. I know that the Government are embarrassed by the RPI statistics, but pathetic efforts to take mortgages, cigarettes and food out of the RPI will not detract from the fact that its level is deplorable. The Government fiddled the unemployment figures; they must not fiddle the RPI figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just been passed a note that deals in part with the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) that the duty on chewing tobacco be increased. I am informed that chewing tobacco is a minor and declining market, but that the Government have taken steps to ban harmful oral snuff. The Treasury described oral snuff as
	<br><blockquote><p>"tobacco particles in a pouch that are placed in the mouth and sucked".</p></blockquote>
I hope that my hon. Friend is convinced that we are aware of the problem. I shall definitely draw the matter to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other ministerial colleagues in the run-up to the next Budget in March 1991, when we will consider whether to raise the duty of chewing tobacco.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Such a ban is welcome.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

The Department of Health already has a budget for that purpose. If I were to ask it to spend more money from the Government's revenue from tobacco duties, I would be on a slippery slope.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a measure of the success of the health warnings given to people about the dangers caused by smoking that, over the past 10 or 15 years, the sale of cigarettes has declined dramatically. Moreover, the average number of cigarettes smoked per person has fallen significantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East described the significant fall in employment in the tobacco industry. At the beginning of his speech, he mentioned several towns, including Newcastle and Swindon, which have suffered from unemployment in the tobacco industry, but at the end of his speech he said that he would not wish people to smoke more cigarettes. He is in a difficult position because he represents a constituency where there used to be employment in the tobacco industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To respond to the hon. Member for Halifax, it is true that, in the past 10 years, duty on cigarettes has risen by 45 per cent. which is a most significant increase, but while duty on cigarettes has been rising, duty on whisky has been going down, which shows the Government's support for the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the remarks made about the report by my colleague on the Public Accounts Committee, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). Its prime point was that preventive measures are cost-effective. The Economic Secretary, with some embarrassment, said that a health education programme would entail greater public expenditure. There may be additional expenditure under one heading, but much money would be saved on Health Service and other bills. That was one of the central arguments of the Public Accounts Committee's report and the Economic Secretary should bear it in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to accept that point. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) asked two questions, one of which I apologise for not answering in detail in the clause 1 stand part debate. Governments must retain fiscal flexibility and, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) said, take account of the changing economic circumstances from one year to the next. It will come as a disappointment to the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) that I cannot make an announcement about duties in the next year's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield asked about excise duties on drinks. Traditionally, they are based on volume and alcoholic strength. Special duties help the Chancellor to set his annual Budget strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East raised several points with which I shall deal briefly. Imports have risen during the past decade, but in the past two or three
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
years import penetration has been dropping. Presently, it is less than 10 per cent. The way to reduce import penetration is for more British manufacturers to produce cigarettes that people want to buy at the cheaper end of the market. Several retailers in my constituency have explained to me that it is not always possible to obtain cheaper cigarettes from British producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) painted a gloomy picture of employment in the industry—one of closure after closure. He failed to mention that there have been substantial investments, not least in my constituency, which has the most modern tobacco curing plant in the world and employees of the highest quality anywhere. Regional policy has played a major part in enabling that to happen, so we as taxpayers have helped to subsidise the appearance of that plant. However, it employs very few people and, to get it going, it was necessary to close down two substantial plants elsewhere in the country with a substantial net job reduction. One has to look at the full round, not just the one dimensional picture that was painted by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot entirely accept the notion that there is unfair dumping of cigarettes. In particular, the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East mentioned West Berlin. If he would draw to my attention any dumping—as he calls it—which contravenes Community regulations or directives, I should be more than pleased to look into the matter for him. However, I am certainly not aware of such dumping and, as I have said, import penetration has diminished over the past two or three years and I hope that the figure will continue to fall as British manufacturers diversify into producing cheaper cigarettes at the bottom end of the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Martlew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather worried that the Minister seems to be encouraging industry to produce cheaper cigarettes and therefore to increase the sales of cigarettes. I should have thought that we would all be concerned about the level of uptake of cigarettes and would not in any way want to encourage the production of cheaper cigarettes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I neither encourage nor discourage the production of cheap or expensive cigarettes. The sort of cigarettes sold depends on the market. I was merely saying, in response to the point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East, that import penetration is at the bottom end of the market and that, as a consequence of greater diversification in British industry, we have met that foreign competition and are producing cigarettes that people wanted to buy. I accept that there may be some brands of cigarettes that are safer to smoke than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not smoke, but if people wish to buy the cheaper brands of cigarettes which may or may not do them greater damage, that is a judgment that they must make themselves. It is not for Government to decide whether cheaper or more expensive cigarettes are better or worse for people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East was concerned above all with coherence. I repeat what I said the other night during a debate on the duties on leaded and unleaded petrol and again in the clause 1 stand part debate. It is incumbent upon any British government to make their own sovereign decisions on excise duties. That applies also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
to cigarettes. If members of the European Community wish to change the system, there has to be unanimity in the Council of Ministers. Under the present Government, there is no chance of our giving up sovereign control over the rate at which we set duties. I fancy that that would be the view of a Labour Government as well. Our coherence on that would be the same as the coherence of a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What assurance is there that, after the abolition of frontiers within the single market, which is scheduled for 1 January 1993, there will be any practical scope for enforcing a differential in excise duties within the Community on tobacco or anything else? Surely it will be open to people quite legally to ship to this country any amount of goods purchased elsewhere in the Community at the local rates of excise duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, imported goods suffer from the same rates as goods produced in this country. It is our firm belief that we should not change the present system, come what may. That belief is shared by opposition Members. As far as I know, they have never declared an opinion contrary to that which has been expressed consistently by the Government over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total tax burden on popularly priced cigarettes in the United Kingdom is some 73 per cent. That is not the highest in the European Community where most countries are grouped between about 69 per cent. and 75 per cent. As Britain falls within that group, it is wrong to assume that we tax our cigarettes more heavily than do other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to respond to the comments of the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East about tax stamps and the controls post-1992. Nine out of 12 member states already have tax stamp regime for tobacco products. The United Kingdom supports the abolition of fiscal frontiers. A feasibility study is currently being undertaken by officials in Customs and Excise to protect our legitimate trade interests and tax yield. No decisions have been taken yet and anyone can make representations to Customs and Excise before a final decision is reached.

I hope that I have answered the main points that have arisen during this debate. It any questions resulting from the debate remain unresolved, I shall be more than happy to write to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to my point about the long-term decline in tobacco manufacturing and how it is managed? He said that he could not tell us today next year's rates of duty. That is acceptable. None the less, planning the manageemnt of the decline in tobacco smoking and, therefore, employment in the tobacco industry, is a very serious matter. It is possible to say that we should ban smoking entirely—although that is unrealistic—or that we should leave things as they are. I hope that we all accept that there is a long-term trend. The Government have a responsibility to assist in the management of that reappraisal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a sensible amendment. Legislation similar to what it proposes exists in most European countries. Only this country has vehicle excise duty of £100, irrespective of the type of car. Large cars contribute to traffic congestion and increase damage to the roads. In general, they produce more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They pollute the quality of life more than small cars, yet a large BMW costs the same to tax—£100—as a Mini.

Belgium, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and West Germany all levy periodic taxes similar to vehicle excise duty. The taxes paid by citizens of those countries are levied in proportion to a car's cylinder capacity, in Denmark and Holland, taxes are levied in proportion to the weight of the car, but not here. Big cars are made and sold because they make more profit for the motor manufacturers.

We have had no green bits in the Budget this year. Now is a chance for the Economic Secretary to make amends. He can tell us that we have a point. Small cars should be encouraged—to reduce petrol consumption, damage to roads and pollution. One way to do that is to levy a lower vehicle excise duty on small cars, which is precisely what our amendment seeks to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is a gentle nudge, within the limit of what can be tabled to the Finance Bill, in the direction that I want the Government to take. We argued in our pre-budget submission that vehicle excise duty should be in a range according to car engine size. I fully agree with the reasons described by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). It is extraordinary that the Government do not use the weapon of the vehicle excise duty to discriminate in favour of vehicle with smaller engines which use less fuel and which creates less pollution. It would have been a natural development to undertake in this budget, but the Government have simply frozen the vehicle excise duty and recouped what they might otherwise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
have got from it through an increase in the petrol duty. We may be able to deal with that briefly on clause stand part because it is perhaps a separate issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Goverment persist in a single, flat-rate vehicle excise duty which applies in the same way to the person on a low income who runs a small car as it does to the company or individual who runs a Rolls-Royce. As I walked towards the House yesterdy, I was passed by a Rolls-Royce with the registration number RR1. I am curious about who owns it, but I know that he pays £ 100 vehicle excise duty, just like all of my constituents who run old, small cars—third or fourth-hand Metros or Fiats—use a great deal less fuel and have a great deal less money with which to pay for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member of Wrexham (Dr. Marek). The Government could have taken the lead in encouraing the purchase of smaller cars. We could have had a bit of green coming into the rather grey area of the budget and they could have reversed the trend towards bigger cars. There is no question of relying on the manufacturers to reverse that trend because they will go for bigger, more complicated cars because they are more profitable. It is quite irresponsible of the Government not to do what the amendment proposes when we hear daily about global warning and the effects of emissions in the atmosphere. We are out of step with all our European partners. I hope that the Minister, in his smart green tie, will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Leadbitter, the Clerk and your colleagues for supplying us with these boxes. Other than the Minister's tie, they are the only green things in the room and the only green things we will consider on this Finance Bill. [Interruption.] Absolutely on cue, my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Miss Hoey) arrives in a charming green dress. Even that, and my hon. Friend herself, cannot compensate for the inadequacy of the Bill in feeling and spirit. No greenery can be found in it, in spite of the number of trees that have been cut down to create it and its accompanying papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vehicles excise duty is a regressive tax. It takes no account of engine size or weight and is the transport equivalent of the poll tax. It affects everybody indiscriminately—those with small cars as well as large— yet some cars impose greater social penalties on others. For example, some cars consume more fuel and exhaust the world's resources. Some cars pump out more carbon dioxide and other noxious emissions, polluting the planet and worsening our lives and those of our children. Some cars badly damage roads. The clause does not take account of those track costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Company car tax varies according to the size of the car engine. The Economic Secretary should examine that precedent. If it can be done with company cars, it should be done with vehicle excise duty. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) said that Britain was the only country in Europe that ignored the social and economic effects of engine size when deciding vehicle excise duty. The list of other countries where an equivalent of vehicle excise duty relates to engine size, includes Belgium, Greece, France, Italy, Luxembourg and West Germany. I did not mention Denmark and Ireland, because they decide vehicle excise duty by car weight, which is equally acceptable. When we discussed that matter on the Floor of the House,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the Economic Secretary was generous enough to see sense in our arguments and put forward several proposals. Will he work out the possible permutations of cost and the potential benefits to the public purse of different levels of vehicle excise duty? If he did that—if only to satisfy himself of the efficacy of the present system— he would understand that vehicle excise duty could be set to benefit the Exchequer and, above all, our environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the Minister's tie on Tuesday and said that it was a coded environmental message, but I was wrong—it is probably his only tie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should differentiate in favour of articulated lorries. Rigid-axled vehicles travel on many minor roads that local authorities have to repair, but they cannot afford to carry out those repairs because of the Government's policies. My local authority was 21st in the list of those that could have been poll tax capped. The first 20 were capped. Roads are damaged by vehicles, but local authorities cannot afford to repair them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many rigid-axled lorries. That is obvious from the frequency with which they hit potholes, causing people to jump as they walk along the streets. The cost of the damage is passed on to the motorist. The potholes affect the suspension, the body and the mechanics of cars. Our amendment is a good one and should be supported. If the Minister cannot find it in his heart to accept it today, perhaps he can look forward to the next Budget and take cognisance of what we are saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that the Government have not increased vehicle excise duty for five years. It has remained at the same monetary value of £100. In real terms, the cost is going down every year. The Minister will make that point. One looks for other taxes that have remained the same cost, year in, year out. I can only think of the dog licence. Even when we went decimal it remained 37½p—having changed from 7/6d. Eventually, it was not worth collecting and was abolished. I am suspicious that that may be what the Government are up to with vehicle excise duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend has hit a significant point. I wish to offer another example to assist his argument—child benefit. Not increasing child benefit, letting it wither on the vine and doing away with it is another example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, but by leaving car taxes alone the public are benefitting, whereas certain sections of the public are severely disadvantaged by what is happening to child benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vehicle excise duty has been held at £100, but administrative costs are going up all the time, as are the costs of collecting from the Post Office and of launching criminal proceedings against people who try to dodge paying. Even the cost of reducing the tax will have gone up. As I come into Westminster every morning, I see a big hoarding spelling out the real price of not paying vehicle excise duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister sums up, I should be grateful if he would tell us whether the Government intend to phase out vehicle excise duty and what they estimate is the costs of so doing. There is an argument for doing that and increasing the price of petrol, which would reduce administrative costs and probably reduce most car owner's mileage. That route is also environmentally sound and politic, but it has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
drawbacks in terms of the effect on post offices and people who live in rural areas who do more essential mileage than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must come clean, and tell us exactly what their intentions are. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said that other taxes have been increased this year because it is not an election year. I am convinced that next year's Budget will not increase vehicle excise duty for the same reason. The Minister must explain to the Committee—and, more important, to the driving public—what the Government's policies are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kate Hoey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vauxhall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Mini driver—and I am proud of it—in London, I rise to echo what has been said about the need to reduce vehicle excise duty for small cars. There is nothing that cannot be done in a Mini that can be done in a larger car. [Interruption.] As I drive in to work in the morning and return at night I get squeezed in by large Daimlers and Jaguars which other Members seem to have. I resent the fact that I have to pay the same as someone who drives a large car that guzzles a lot of petrol and does a great deal of environmental damage
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister is not responsible for this, but is it really necessary for Ministers—whichever party is in Government—to be driven round in such large cars? There is no reason why smaller cars could not be used in London. I accept that driving long distances is different; a journey in a mini on the motorway is not necessarily very nice. Perhaps that small point could be considered. I hope that Ministers in the next Labour Government will be happy to drive around London in minis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief supplementary question for the Economic Secretary: what will be the increase per gallon to match the abolition of vehicle excise duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) has asked two specific questions—one about the cost of the amendment and the other about the additional cost to petrol duty if we were to abolish VED. The first answer is £200 million; the second is about 40p a gallon. So this amendment will cost the Government about £200 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until I prepared for this debate, I did not realise that we used to have VED graduated according to horsepower. That was abolished by a Labour Government, in 1947. I would have been interested to discover why they abolished it. In general terms, it would have had the same affect as this amendment. Unfortunately, my researches came to nought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was concerned about the cost of travelling for less well off people and for the retired. The standstill on VED over the past few years has made travelling cheaper. If VED were to be pitched at the rate it was at some years ago, it would not be £140, £150 or £160, which is significantly more than it is today. So our policy over the past five years has been to freeze VED and to put up petrol duty so that those who travel furthest and those who have bigger cars pay more, and those who travel less and those with smaller cars pay less. Our policy will have the same effect on the driving habits of the British people as would amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that the amendment has superficial attraction, but I must distinguish between small vehicles and fuel-efficient vehicles. They are not necessarily the
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
same thing. For example, a Skoda 120 and a Citreon AX11 have a similar engine capacity, but their touring fuel consumption differs by 20 miles per gallon. Fuel efficiency and smallness do not necessarily go together. There are some cars with small engine capacities that make up for their lack of performance by adding turbochargers, which increase their performance and fuel consumption. So one could buy a small car, fit it with a turbocharger, and pay the same amount of VED as for a car without a turbocharger. That could drive a coach and horses through the amendment if it were ever included in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, there is the question of the state of the British car industry. In 1989, 58 per cent. of all new cars of less than l,500cc capacity were imported. Italy is typical of the countries that produce small capacity cars which the United Kingdom does not import because there is insufficient incentive to do so. However, a reduction in VED could tip the balance and change British demand habits so that people would be more likely to buy cheaper and foreign cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, a person who is reqired to choose between a car costing, say, £5,000 and one costing £7,000 will not make the decisions simply because it might be possible to save £20 a year on VED. People's purchasing habits and desires in respect of cars will not be influenced by a £20 differential. Such habits are not affected at the moment by 15 per cent. VAT and 10 per cent. car tax, which penalise the purchase of the more expensive cars most heavily. While I can see the superficial attraction of the graduation proposed in the amendment, a closer examination of the detail reveals its shortcomings. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment if the Opposition do not withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed to hear the same old argument trotted out year after year, which is that the British car industry is not yet ready to cope with an adjustment of vehicle excise duty. The view that the car industry must be propped up with excise duties so that it can continue to produce the cars that nobody wants to buy is old hat. I thought that the Goverment believed that the industry should build the cars for which there is popular demand both at home and abroad, without the need for excise duty props.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the Minister's criticisms of limitations of engine size as a measure had merit, but that yardstick is better than nothing. He must take some steps in that direction if vehicle excise duty is to continue, but he has not answered the question about its future. He has given the impression that its real value will fall and that it will be transferred gradually to petrol prices. Is it the intention that VED should be abolished, or not? The last Labour Government considered getting rid of vehicles excise duty and transferring it all to petrol. That was at a time when the support of the Liberal party was important to the Labour Government's ability to win Divisions in the House. We considered it a most undesirable change because of the impact of a drastic rise in petrol prices in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the problem also caused lengthy internal arguments in our own party, because it is so difficult to quantify. There is at least some truth in the argument that the mileage of the poorest rural consumers is relatively low. Families such as those of farm workers have to have car— usually an old car—to get in to town to shop, but they cover relatively short distances. I should like to see some research into who would suffer most if there was a shift from vehicle excise duty to higher petrol prices. But there are many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
reasons why a system of vehicle excise licensing must be retained. Cars must be indentified, and located in the event of accidents or theft. Sustaining a licensing system without a licence fee would present quite a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government intend to abolish vehicle excise duty? From the way in which the Minister is shaking his head, it appears that they will not. I hope that he will clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the hon. Gentleman briefly. At present, there are no plans to abolish VED. I am not surprised that there were internal arguments in the Liberal party in 1978 and 1979 about whether it should support the Labour Government's intention to abolish VED, becaue half the Liberal Members of Parliament represented urban constituencies and half rural ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may find that the same argument goes on in his and the Labour party. The issue is a difficult one to resolve. If the Government intend to keep vehicle excise duty, they should grade it. There are arguments for keeping it rather than taking the other solution. That is why I am sympathetic to the Opposition amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Minister's failure to respond to the point that I made earlier, will he explain why the Chancellor did not raise vehicle excise duty this year? When he does that, we shall probably know whether the Government intend to put it up next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are content to let the real value of vehicle excise duty fall so low so that they can eventually get rid of it altogether. The value will be debased considerably this year as inflation will be at least 10 per cent., and probably more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard the usual explanations of why something should not be done. There are always 99 reasons why we should not do something, but sometimes the one reason for doing it is more important than the 99 for not doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to green policies, the Government are hell-bent on trotting out the 99 reasons, be it at a conference in Bergen, or on what to do with Antarctica, or on what to do with sulphur emissions from power stations. No matter what it is, the Government always backtrack and say that it cannot be done yet.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could have a long debate on this because Government policy on track costs of lorries seems to be in a complete shambles. I raised the matter some years ago on a previous Finance Bill and have received promises from Economic Secretaries that they will examine the matter and get it right; yet, after five or six years or more, the situation is worse than ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to one specific point, let us consider in the yellow book, "The allocation of road track costs 1990–91", issued by the Department of Transport—the columns in table 8 pertaining to rigid three and four-axle vehicles. The extreme right-hand column shows the taxes minus costs per vehicle. The figures for three-axle vehicles are: £680 for 15–17 tonnes; £739 for 17–19 tonnes; £801 for 19–21 tonnes; £861 for 21–23 tonnes; and £931 for 23–25 tonnes. The figures for four-axle vehicles are: £493 for 23–25 tonnes; £543 for 25–27 tonnes; £608 for 27–29 tonnes; and £678 for 29–31 tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These figures are for 1990–91. For 1989–90, the taxes minus costs per vehicle for a four-axle vehicle between 29 and 31 tonnes were £1,033. That compares with a figure of £678 for this year, which does not make sense. These vehicles are of the class that most damages roads. The Government will doubtless give the same excuse that they gave when the Budget was announced and the Chancellor said that he wanted to simplify taxation. However, they are discriminating unfairly against articulated and heavy five-axle lorries and cutting the amount paid for covering the track costs of the class of vehicle that most damages road. That is nonsense and the Economic Secretary should admit as much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
The Opposition could not table amendments that would increase taxation for rigid three and four-axle vehicles. We wanted to, but, instead, we tabled amendments to lower the vehicle excise duty on certain classes of articulated lorries. There is discrimination as between the two classes of vehicles. There is also much discrimination as between lorries and cars. About 150,000 cars are needed to do the same damage as one well-loaded lorry, but cars cover their track costs by about 3.6 times—the figures are in the documents, so I shall not search for them now. Car drivers pay far more than lorry drivers towards covering their track costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Track costs do not include damage to underground utilities such as pipes, or ambulance costs, NHS services, environmental damage, building damage, social costs, court time taken up with motoring offences, or other pollutants. Freight must be moved around by lorries: there is no alternative. However much we want to move freight onto rail, if we did not move freight around by lorries, the country would quickly seize up. Taxation should be dispassionate, fair and objective and should not unfairly penalise one set of users. The Government's policy does not reflect that, and the least that I expect is that the Economic Secretary will try to get it right for next year, because it is apparently too late to do anything about it this year. It is high time something was done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to give the Committee the impression that Government policy is based exclusively on the advice that they receive from the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). Over the past few years, he has demanded that the Government meet certain targets, and each year we have met them, because despite what he said in his speech, he and I—the Opposition and the Government—share the same objective of greater equity between rigids and artics. I say that for the benefit of my hon. Friends, who may not be aware of the relevance of this debate. During the past few years, the Government have tried to close the gap between artics and rigids, because we take the view that rigids can do much more damage to roads, particularly minor roads, which they use more often, because tipper lorries, quarry lorries used for aggregate, and delivery lorries operate on smaller roads, as against the artics, which generally use motorways. Like the Opposition, we believe that we should close the gap further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the hon. Member for Wrexham a few figures. Last year, the hon. Gentleman referred to table 9 in the yellow book, "The allocation of road track costs", issued by the Department of Transport, which shows the ratio of motoring tax to costs. He asked whether the Government could do three things. First, he asked if the ratio of 3.4:1 for the private/light goods vehicle class could be brought down. He will see that it has been reduced from 3.4:1 to 3.2:1. He asked whether the ratio of 1.1:1 for goods vehicles over 3·5 tonnes could be raised; it is now 1.3:1. He asked if the ratio for goods vehicles under 3·5 tonnes could be reduced; this year, we have reduced VED on all 200,000 such vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to give the impression that when Ministers consider these matters in January and February, they think to themselves, "Ah! What would the hon. Member for Wrexham be advising us to do as we sit here in the Treasury?" I know that he is a very modest man, but we do take account of the views that he has expressed over the past few years, in the Committee, where he has given the Government much useful advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Economic Secretary can tell me that further progress will be made next year, I shall resume my seat immediately, and we can pass on to the next clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to overstate the link between Opposition requests and Government actions. Nevertheless, it is our objective, as the hon. Gentleman knows, to close the gap still further. This year we have made big strides. There are four parts to the schedule, and I do not believe that the hon. Member for Wrexham disagrees with any of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked me a specific question about table 8. What he says is true, in particular about the heavier rigids. They have a lower band of tax to costs, despite the increases in VED, which no doubt the hon. Gentleman will have noticed. The reason is that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport keeps an eye on the road track costs of all vehicles. In the last year, the costs of the vehicles have risen and their impact on the roads has increased by an amount greater than their increases in VED. That helps to explain why it is necessary to raise their VED to pay for that extra burden. The hon. Member for Wrexham would probably agree with that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to resist the amendment, although it would cost the Revenue only a small amount of money. I do so because of the direction in which the Government have been going in the past few years, and in which we shall continue to go in the years to come. My response to the hon.

I had hoped that we would debate an amendment to clause 11, but the Chairman ruled that it was not in order. I accept that judgment, so I shall speak only in general terms.

The clause relates to whether VAT should be allowable on directors' accommodation. My first point concerns the Customs and Excise consultation document. The consultation process on domestic accommodation provided by businesses for employees has already started. Why should employees be treated differently from conmpany directors? If it is worth consulting on the rights of employees, the process should be extended to directors. That is one reason for anxiety about clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 7 of the consultation paper on employees' accommodation provided by businesses contradicts the paper's thesis somewhat. The paper's main thrust is that VAT on domestic accommodation should not be allowable. However, page 7 states that an exception might be made if providing the accommodation was essential to the company's business. Perhaps insufficient attention has been paid to clause 11. Why should not the provision also apply to company directors?

As our proceedings this evening do not allow sufficient time to debate the matter, it is worth saying that there is a strong argument for the validity of the status quo. It is rightly allowable that directors or employees who are based outside London but have to attend meetings in London should do so overnight. Surely a flat that is used by a succession of people for one or two nights as an alternative to a hotel has the advantage of being less expensive and always at the company's disposal, so to use it would be legitimate practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Diane Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that as we proceed through the Bill, it will become clear that insufficient attention has been given to the acceptability of the status quo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Diane Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the widespread public outrage at the grotesque, wholly disproportionate pay rises that British management, including directors, have awarded themselves? Given that outrage, why should he argue for yet another perk? After awarding itself huge pay rises, British management now argues for lavish perks as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Lady's argument, and sympathise with her. I believe that the Prime Minister has also publicly expressed her concern about those increases. But, statistically, only very few company directors have found themselves in such an extraordinary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point sums up my anxiety about the clause. There is an ongoing legal debate which relates to whether United Kingdom legislation is being laid in advance of the requirements of the EEC's sixth directive on VAT. The key phrase is
	<br><blockquote><p>"used or to be used in making taxable supplies",</p></blockquote>
whereas the sixth directive uses the words:
	<br><blockquote><p> "used for the purposes of his taxable transactions".</p></blockquote>
The debate continues, and we have not paid sufficient attention to it tonight. My anxiety about clause 11 is shared by some of my hon. Friends. We will move speedily this evening, but I assure my hon. Friend that the subject will not go away and that we shall return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having felt that we had won over the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and that he had become an hon. Friend by geographical proximity, sitting as he is, on our side of the Committee—admittedly he blotted his copybook by not voting with us, but we took that to be an aberration—I am sad to say that his strategy is now clear. He has not come over here to side with us; he is trying to drive us onto the Tory Benches to vote with the Government. I had thought better of him, but his motive has become clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the hon. Gentleman referred to the famous apple and pear case, with which we are all familiar. It is why the Government included this clause about domestic accommodation for directors. We have always opposed tied cottage provisions and not even the eloquence of the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) will persuade us to support his proposal, for the serious reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott). For far too long the butter has been spread very thinly for many people, but it is pretty thick on the directors' half of the sandwich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, there have been 30 per cent. pay rises for the top 100 managers in the United Kingdom, yet working people are blamed for the Government's fiasco of trying to control inflation, which is now approaching 10 per cent. They are blamed, yet wage levels here are in no way comparable with wage costs in Europe. Working people are being made the scapegoats. The Government blame wage rises for what is often Government induced inflation and their inability to control exchange rates or the trade deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people can avoid the consequences of the Government's incompetence. They are the people who can award themselves hefty pay rises—notably, company directors. Despite the efforts of my former hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, I think that I shall follow my hon. Friends on the Front Bench and vote against the proposal, should it come to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that what I say will drive the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) back to his side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I came to the House, I have had a hobby-house about the complexity of tax law. The more we amend it, the more complicated it becomes. But tax law should not be complicated; it should be comprehensible to the man in the street. If it is not comprehensible, it will be neither obeyed nor respected. We should avoid taking too many bites of the cherry when amending tax law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twenty-one days ago, Customs and Excise introduced a consultation paper which, if implemented, would effectively apply the provisions of the clause to employees as well as to directors. I have read the paper, which contains some extremely valid points. Unfortunately, the clause would legislate to do something for directors but not for employees who may be in similar circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no interest to declare. I am not a director; I hold no brief for or against directors. Directors and employees should not be treated as though one side is an apple and the other a pear. Often, they are in extremely similar circumstances and that is precisely why Customs and Excise introduced its consultation paper 21 days ago, suggesting that they should perhaps be treated in the same way.

I have much sympathy for the matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter). I also have much sympathy with the amendment which was, I regret to say, ruled out of order. I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will take these matters firmly into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are huge avoidance loopholes in this area and it is right for the Government to try to tighten them. I have never heard so much nonsense from hon. Members pleading special cases. I know company directors who would not take advantage of such a loophole, and it surprises me that Conservative Members are again arguing for more gravy for their special friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any personal interest in the clause although I am an adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which, along with many other organisations, is worried about the clause. I echo the concern expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the clause introduces the wholly new term "domestic purpose" and it would have been beneficial to define it. That would improve the legislation and reduce the uncertainty that might otherwise arise when deciding whether input VAT was recoverable. Secondly, what does the term "relative", as used in the clause, mean? I have a second cousin who is a director. Is he a relative, for the purposes of the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worry for Scottish businesses is that the clause is too widely drafted and fails to take account of certain situations when the provision of accommodation is solely for business purposes. Many Scottish-based businesses maintain accommodation in, for example, London, for the sole purpose of reducing hotel bills and accommodation costs if employees, including directors, are required to stay there when on a business trip. Under the clause it appears that VAT on such accommodation would be wholly disallowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criticism and worry about the clause as drafted is that Customs has failed to distinguish between what I think the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) referred to as accommodation that is a home, or second home, and accommodation which is no more than the equivalent of a hotel. The worries expressed are genuine, and the widespread feeling is that Customs is guilty of a shotgun approach. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford suggested, it would be much more sensible to delay implementation of these matters until directors and employees can be treated on an equal basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) and for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) for their contributions. Clearly any contributions of theirs will be looked at, because I do not want my hon. Friends to believe for a single moment that the clause has been rushed. On the contrary, a consultation document was issued in 1987— three years ago. The Government have been considering this issue for a long time. During that time there has been such abuse and uncertainty that tribunals have made decisions one way or the other without any consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances it is incumbent upon the Government to take the only path: to try to clarify the law. That is exactly what we have done. If directors' flats are
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
used for business purposes, their friendly VAT officers— sympathetic as ever—will be in a position to allow apportionment. If a room is used for an office, if there is a fax machine or if someone works in a room part-time, that will be deductible in the usual way but at the discretion of the VAT officer. Apportionment is an important aspect that has been overlooked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood asked a specific question about the word "relative". I understand that under section 22 of the Companies Act 1985 a member is defined as a person who subscribes to the memorandum of association upon registration of the company and also includes any person who has agreed to become a member of a company and whose name is registered in its register of members. A "relative" takes its normal meaning and includes mother, father, offspring and spouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke that we have cleared this with the Commission, and it is entirely in keeping with the sixth directive to which he referred—in particular, to paragraph 17.2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to support the clause in the full knowledge that the consultation process has taken the Government three years. It has not been rushed; we have listened to everyone, just as we shall listen to everyone's views on the consultation document on employees that we issued in April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Facts are immovable and cannot turn out to be something different from what they were earlier.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a problem. A trader might habitually make an error—perhaps not entirely innocently, but one that he persuades the Revenue is innocent. The time from which interest is paid on that error should be earlier than it is under the clause. Interest on an error on every quarter for five quarters would not be paid until after those five quarters had finished. A reasonable person would say that interest on that error should start earlier.
