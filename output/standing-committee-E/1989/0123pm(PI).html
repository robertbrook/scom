<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the point of order raised this morning by the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones). I have considered it carefully, but I still feel that the amendment is not selectable. It is not the practice of the Chair to give the reasons why an amendment is or is not selected, but I hope that rather than being purely negative, I can give the hon. Gentleman some hope.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the matter of the extent of the application of the Bill, which his amendment would limit. Clause 60 deals precisely with the extent of the Bill and which of its clauses should be applied in which parts of the United Kingdom. Our debate on that seems to me a place where I would look sympathetically at any amendments such as that which the hon. Gentleman has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'> (Ynys Mon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you. Dame Janet, for the way in which you have considered my request. May I ask for your guidance on two further matters? Can any amendment to clause 60 refer to parts of the Bill rather than the whole Bill? Secondly, if the amendment is selected for debate at a later stage, would it come at the end of the debate on the whole Bill, or at the end of the debate on that part of the Bill that I wish to exclude? I seek your guidance on the timing of such debate in order to decide whether to move an amendment at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot give guidance on hypothetical amendments; I have to look at them as they come to me. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will find that the Clerk is always helpful in dealing with these matters privately.<br><br>
As regards timing, we have to follow the order that the Committee has already set out for the consideration of amendments and clauses, and if the hon. Gentleman looks at the front of the audit paper, he will see where clause 60 lies. I am afraid that I cannot tell him more than that at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'> (Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. This is obviously a somewhat esoteric matter, but it is extremely important for those of us who represent Welsh constituencies. Some provisions in the Bill affect only Wales. Some make changes in the existing legislation and remove special provisions for Wales, and others affect Wales only by implication, although not by intention, because of the administrative arrangements. I take it.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
Dame Janet, from the nature of your reply that when such matters arise, amendments would not be ruled out automatically but would be considered. Your guidance on that point would give us some reasurrance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can make it clear that the ruling is in relation to the amendment on which I was asked to give a decision. That does not prejudge what will happen on any other amendment, or indeed any new clause, that hon. Members might wish to table. Each will be dealt with individually.<br><br>
We must now move on the amendments to clause 27.</span></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 27</div> <!-- clause -->

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
NHS CONTRACTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'> (Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 339 in, page 23, line 46, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'but notwithstanding such arrangements, any person may. on referral by their general medical practitioner (whether or not that general medical practitioner is in fund-holding practice) obtain goods or services at any National Health Service hospital, or other establishment or facility, or any National Health Service trust, whether or not there is any National Health Service contract in existence which would cover the provision of such goods or services.".</p></blockquote>
I must apologise to the Minister for not moving amendment No. 337, just in case he had some smart-Alec remarks to make in response. He will now have to try to work those remarks into his response to amendment No. 339. I hope that the Minister has not issued a press release about amendment No. 337, without making it known to the Committee—a tendency of his. The Minister complained about the number of amendments I tabled—he likes lots of advance notice about amendments to enable his advisers to prepare briefs for him—and, in a press release last week, said that they copied the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends, to the clauses dealing with England. If the Minister introduces clauses that are the exact replicas of English clauses, he must expect me to table similar amendments to those clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I inquire when the hon. Gentleman is going to relate his remarks to the amendment under consideration?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do that now.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that clause 4 was probably the most important clause in the Bill. In a sense, he is right. Clause 27 is one of the most important clauses for Scotland because it paves the way for opt-out hospitals and for GPs to operate their own budgets. Without clauses 4 and 27, that would not be possible.<br><br>
My contention is that despite the claims made by the Secretary of State and the junior Minister, clauses 4 and 27, rather than giving greater choice to patients, will lead to a limitation on choice. The clauses are part of the process towards the commercialisation of the Health Service that the Under-Secretary has been implementing since he became a Minister, but that had been started before that time of making genera! managers force local health boards constantly to consider their budgets in business terms and rather than giving patients the choices that they want.<br><br>
I shall relate my remarks to the clause and to the amendment by giving a little of the background of what is happening in Scotland. Therefore I hope that you. Dame Janet, will give me a little latitude—even
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
if it is not as much as I would like—because in giving that background I shall stray a little from relevance.<br><br>
The process of general managers and financial methods, in particular for Glasgow and Lothian, has resulted in the Lothian health board facing a deficit of £12 million. It now has to make enormous cuts in services to put that right. The Minister has said that the Lothian health board must rectify that, because it is nothing to do with him and he does not intend to bail it out. On the other hand, the Glasgow health board has a £4 million underspend. Both of those health boards are a disgrace because they have general managers who are supposed to manage them in a business-like way financially, but the Minister interferes and they are unable to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully. It is remarkable that a few sentances ago he criticised the Government's anxiety about budgets, and then went on to discuss Lothian, which, because of a lack of financial control, has spent almost £12 million more than it thought it had. It is only because central Government have intervened that patient care is not at risk. The hon. Gentleman has contradicted himself. Good management control delivers patient care as much as any other activity in the Health Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the case of both health boards the Government insist—and we shall debate the matter later—that the share formula be imposed and be worked through to its final stages in 18 months instead of over the much longer period that is required for quality—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is this year. It is part of the cuts in the budget that the Minister should be aware of. In Glasgow, the £4 million underspend was on top of an £11 million cut in its budget which it had to impose. I give one example, which relates to patient choice. The Greater Glasgow health board is not replacing ancillary staff who leave. This has led to a ludicrous situation at the Gartnavel general hospital, where two dieticians have left in the past three months. They were the only dieticians in the hospital, and doctors are now trying to run a diabetic clinic with no dieticians to advise them. That is absurd, but it is exactly the sort of cut that the Government have imposed upon the Glasgow health board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'> (Mid Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Bill eradicate precisely such deficiencies in the organisation of the Health Service?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. My argument will show that the reverse is true, and that the process of imposing financial controls and so-called internal markets on the Health Service—which the clause will do—will lead to greater cuts, less choice and the sort of privatisation of services that has happened in Glasgow. It will lead to an even poorer-quality service for patients.<br><br>
The amendment is designed to give choice to patients and to ensure that they have the right to decide where to get the health care that they want. I live in Hamilton, which is covered by the health board in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke). If I consult my doctor about an injury and he says that I should see a consultant I can choose a consultant at the Western infirmary in Glasgow. But when internal markets have been established, and contracts have been drawn up, I shall no longer have that choice. When I consult my doctor about an injury, he will not be able to refer me to Mr. So-and-So at the Western infirmary unless the Larnarkshire health board has a contract with that hospital to undertake the operation that I need. The doctor may, of course, say to me "If you want to pay, Mr. So-and-So may see you, but if you do not, you will have to go to Monklands hospital or Strathclyde hospital, which are the two in your area within the Health Service that do the operation that you need."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made available to the hon. Gentleman the guidance letter on contracts which is going out today to Scottish Health Service managers. The hon. Gentleman has had an opportunity to study it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D.N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'> (Workington) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where is it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is on the Table.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has asserted that his GP will be unable to have this choice, but that is not true. Where, in the guidance to general managers on the operation of contracts, did he read what he has just told the Committee? GPs will be able to refer patients wherever they believe necessary. It is written in the Bill that, in an emergency, they can do that in the absence of a contract.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, according to the letter, in an emergency or if provision for such an operation is not available in the health board area under the usual contract, patients can be referred elsewhere. But if the operation is available, no choice will be allowed elsewhere under the terms of the Bill or the letter. The issue is one of choice; we ought to ensure that patients have it. First, they should be able to choose where treatment will be given. Secondly, there is a grave danger under the clause of movement towards monopoly in many health board areas. One hospital, especially if it is an opt-out hospital, will undertake operations at a lower price than is generally available elsewhere. The other units will not get patients, so eventually they will close. A monopoly position will then occur. Whatever Conservative Members may say about competition being a spur to efficiency, all market-place organisations seek monopoly because it allows them to charge the prices that they choose and make maximum profits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Member for Cathcart again. He has moved to another subject to which I shall be happy to respond later. Before he begins discussing monopolies, will he substantiate his comment that GPs would not be able to refer patients where, in their clinical judgment, the patients ought to go. Where in the Bill, the working papers or the circular sent to general managers is the information that is the basis for that comment? It is not true. GPs will be able to refer patients wherever they, in their clinical judgment, think they should go.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
The hon. Gentleman must either acknowledge that or point to evidence that enables him to claim otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I do not understand the contracting process. Why are we debating the clause if there are not to be contracts whose terms and conditions doctors must agree with and abide by under the Health Service provisions of their area?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'> (Livingston)</span></span>
<span class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon. Friend that in the past week we have debated clause 3, which makes the English parallel provision that hospitals that do not have a contract with the health authority for the district from which the patient comes will be able to take him into hospital.<br><br>
The sole exception provided for in the clause is a case of a patient requiring immediate access because of an emergency condition. That is the only provision in the Bill that allows a patient to be taken without a contract.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right; and in Scotland, to some extent, even that provision is not provided by the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have the right to reply. He must not keep interfering with and interrupting my speech. I cannot understand his point about contracts unless there is a limitation on services and a contract has been drawn up between a provider of services and the acquirer of it. What is the point of going through the contract and developing the so-called internal market if any GP can refer any patient anywhere he wishes if, in his clinical judgement, that is the best course to take?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'> (Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think it possible that hospitals that are especially good at a service will benefit and be able to improve that service further as a result of the money following the patient? The proposal will stop the constant scream, "We cannot do it because the health board will not allow us".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The money will follow the patient only if there is a contract. I should like to hear the Minister's full explanation and justification for the term "contract between acquirer and provider" if no such contract is necessary between health boards for a patient to be referred to a particular hospital. The proposal is absolute nonsense. Doctors and patients have that choice now but will not have it under the new arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins <span class='memberconstituency'> (Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to paragraph 3.16 of "Working for Patients Contracts for Health Services: Operational Principles" which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A presumption of the right of a GP to make an extra-contractual referral cannot therefore guarantee that the DHA would in all cases agree to meet the cost".</p></blockquote>
We have put that point to the English Minister, who failed to assure us about where the money would come from. Perhaps my hon. Friend would care to put the question to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. friend is right.<br><br>
<i>[Interruption]</i><br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
The Minister mutters that it is not a Scottish Office document and so does not cover Scotland. Its provisions, however, with one exception, are almost word for word those that appear in the Bill, the Bill that applies to England and Wales. Therefore, the same principles will apply in Scotland as in England and Wales.<br><br>
The Government want a system that is so-called efficient. However the Government, especially the Minister, always relate efficiency with cheapness. They want the cheapest service, not the most efficient service. The Minister should realise that the most efficient provision of health care may cost more rather than less.<br><br>
If a patient is admitted to the Southern General hospital in Glasgow, a full medical record card is drawn up. If the patient suffers a heart attack three days later and is taken to the Western infirmary, that hospital has no access to the medical card that has been drawn up. There is a need to spend an enormous sum to bring patients' records under computer control so that they can be assessed by all hospitals in Glasgow. The general manager of the Greater Glasgow health board, Mr. Laurence Peterken intends to deal with the problem by privatising the records service. He intends to put patients' confidential medical records out to tender. It is worrying that a private company, perhaps a pharmaceutical company, might run the records system. To produce an efficient system more money should be spent, which is not what the Government intend to do.<br><br>
The Government want the cheapest possible service by the cheapest possible means. They want to put all the emphasis on doctors and make them think about money and about how much an operation will cost. A medical friend who performs kidney transplants, told me recently, "When a patient comes to consult me, I do not want to have to base my decision on the following choices: first, if I do not operate I shall not be able to pay the mortgage this month—that is how it works in some systems; secondly, I am not up to my quota of this operation, and if I do not deal with this patient and another 20 before the end of the financial year, we shall not fulfil our contract with the Lanark health board—as a result we shall not get our full money, and that will put the unit, and perhaps some of its staff, at risk; thirdly, I cannot operate on this patient because we have no money left for that." A doctor should not have to make those choices. His judgment should be based on the needs of the patient at that point in time. The doctor may decide, "I do not want to take this patient's gall bladder out—we can solve the problem by dietary control rather than by an operation." The clause is pushing the Health Service towards wholly commercial attitudes. Such a move will destroy the NHS as we know it because judgments will be made always for commercial reasons.<br><br>
I end with another quote from the same doctor. He said to me "I cannot understand why the Government insist on so-called business efficiency, bringing the British business man, the Scottish business man, into the NHS. Britain's NHS is admired around the world. People come to Britain to study it. They copy it in other countries. They do not come to Britain to copy our business methods, so why should we introduce business methods into the NHS to produce so-called business efficiency?"</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That must be just about the most remarkable speech that I have ever heard from the Front Bench. For the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) to argue that an organisation such as the Health Service in Scotland, which employs 150,000 people and spends more than £3 billion, should not be run on a businesslike basis is quite remarkable. It is as much in the interests of patient care that the Health Service should be run well as that it should have the machinery, specialist equipment and skills needed to provide patient care.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart was frank enough to say that he did not understand why we were introducing contracts, and that was evident from his speech. Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. I suspect that he does not understand because of his blind prejudice against the Government's motives. He said that we were concerned only about money. If that were true, there would be no need for contracts. The purpose of contracts is to enable health boards to establish, for the first time, levels of quality as well as the price for the delivery of that quality as specified. We want to establish contracts between health boards and other health authorities and other health boards and private sector providers so that the level of quality and the price at which it will be delivered can be defined. Management can thus see that it is delivered, in the interests of patient care.<br><br>
By arguing against contracts, the hon. Member for Cathcart is arguing against a system that will ensure the maximum standard of care in the Health Service. He attacked Conservative Members for not being interested in quality but Opposition Members, in rejecting contracts, are rejecting the mechanism which will deliver that quality.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart said that contracts would limit choice. If the amendment were accepted, health boards would be obliged to pay for any referral by a GP, whether or not there was a contract with the hospital in question. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to carry his argument to absurdity? If a GP were making inappropriate referrals, should the health board continue to take them? If something had gone wrong in the system, and the GP was unaware of certain treatment being available, should the health board not have the power to influence that situation?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart is portraying the present system as one in which GPs can refer patients to anyone they choose, but that is not the position. I will tell the hon. Gentleman what happens in Scotland if a GP refers a patient outside the health board area in which the patient is resident. For example, if a constituent of mine is referred to Glasgow, the Greater Glasgow health board will not be reimbursed for providing treatment for that patient at the time, or even in the year, that the treatment is given. If the health board is lucky, it will receive the average cost two or three years later. The hospital departments that provide treatment and expend resources in so doing are therefore not reimbursed. The proposed changes will ensure that money will follow the patient and allow departments such as the excellent ones in Glasgow to plan ahead.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart is turing his face
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
against such a system and doing those departments a disservice. At present, because the money does not follow the patient, waiting lists build up and the departments cannot offer the service that the GPs want. The choice to which the hon. Gentleman refers is an illusion, but the choice that comes from contracts will be a real choice, patients will be welcomed because they will bring resources. The hon. Gentleman fails to understand that, as his woolly amendment shows. He admitted that he did not understand why contracts were to be introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misinterprets my words. I said that I failed to understand why contracts were being introduced in view of what he said about freedom of choice and the ability of doctors to send patients wherever they wished. That is quite different from the Minister's interpretation of my remarks.<br><br>
Why are so many doctors and administrators in Glasgow terrified that many of the units will have disappeared before the scheme has a chance to work, because of the cuts imposed under the so-called share formula? Many hospitals are finding it difficult to operate and face further dramatic cuts next year. The expertise of which the Minister boasts will have disappeared by the time the Government's scheme comes into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has changed his ground. He asked me about funding problems in Glasgow. My hon. Friends whose constituencies are south of the border may be interested to know that Greater Glasgow is the best-funded health board in the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman now argues that a system of funding health boards and authorities which takes account of population morbidity and mortality is not an appropriate basis on which to allocate funds to health boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart argued that the share formula meant that Glasgow was disadvantaged. The share formula allocates resources to health boards according to population and to demographic mortality and morbidity. On the basis of the share formula, Glasgow has been over-funded for years, mainly because people have left Glasgow, no doubt fleeing the effects of a Labour-controlled local authority. People have moved out of Glasgow and the Government have built new hospitals on the periphery of the city— for example, the new Paisley district hospital and the new hospital in Ayr. — Resources Have flowed to them. To allow the health board to adjust to such changes, the Government have weighted the growth moneys to ensure that until now Glasgow has never had negative growth. That is the position as it relates to Glasgow. The hon. Gentleman should not confuse the two issues.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to allow GPs to continue to refer patients to health boards outside their area, but they will be able to do so under the Bill as drafted. If they are not fund-holding GPs, they will do so by means of a contract which will specify levels of quality. Clause 17B states that when there is no contract and the matter is urgent, GPs will be free to refer patients outside their area. If it is not urgent, the health board will be able to make arrangements about price and quality to reflect the decisions of the GP.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman does not want to intervene?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cathcart and his hon. Friends cannot substantiate what they said about Scotland. The hon. Gentleman asked me why people in Glasgow are worried. It is because he and his colleagues spent the last year spreading false stories about GPs being unable to send patients where they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke <span class='memberconstituency'> (Monklands, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was provoked to intervene by the description of the Health Service in Glasgow. I did not recognise it and neither, I suspect, would the majority of people in Glasgow.<br><br>
The Minister claimed that Greater Glasgow is best-funded health authority in the United Kingdom. Can he explain the number of ex-nurses—I emphasise the word "ex"—who attend my Saturday surgeries in Strathkelvin, which is served by the Greater Glasgow health board? Those ex-nurses left the service with the board's agreement to gain better qualifications in midwifery. They spent several years getting those qualifications but cannot now find jobs because there are none. The board says that there are no jobs because it has run out of money. Is that what value for money means in the best-funded health authority in the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke). His approach is usually more considered. I will look into his constituency cases if he cares to write to me about them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are not just constituency cases. The whole of Glasgow is affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there are more nurses and midwives in the Greater Glasgow health board than there were when his party was in office and their pay has risen by 45 per cent. in real terms. The Labour Government cut the number of nurses and cut their pay by a quarter. The Great Glasgow health board is the highest funded board per head of population in the United Kingdom. It has made management and operational changes to the benefit of patients in the teeth of opposition from Labour Members of Parliament with constituencies in the Greater Glasgow health board area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy <span class='memberconstituency'> (Ross, Cromarty and Skye) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to lose the thread of my argument. I am trying to respond to points made by the hon. Member for Cathcart. He said that the system of contracts would extend commercialisation in the NHS and criticised the Greater Glasgow health board and others for involving private contractors in competitive tendering. If the hon. Gentleman believes that the motive is to extend commercialisation, why does he think that that is necessary? Health boards can already make contracts with the private sector— the Bill will enable them to make contracts with one another within the NHS. The Bill will strengthen the NHS. It is ridiculous to argue that it means sinister privatisation. Health boards already have power to make contracts with the private sector.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the Greater Glasgow area enjoys the highest per capita health expenditure in the United Kingdom. That may be so. But as somebody who likes intellectually rigorous argument, he would accept the caveat that Greater Glasgow is a European blackspot in terms of preventable illnesses, especially heart disease. It makes sense that more money per capita should be devoted to it in the light of that depressing fact. That is why the money is there. It does not mean, as the Minister suggested, that somehow health care in Glasgow is on a better footing than anywhere else in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree completely. Conservative Members would be the last to argue that input into the Health Service should be the measure of its success. In arguing that the health of the people of Glasgow is not reflected in the expenditure on the Health Service the hon. Gentleman makes the case that is central to the Bill. The Government's strategy within the Health Service in Scotland is to put more emphasis on preventive medicine. That is behind the new contracts for GPs. We have had precious little support from Opposition Members in our attempt to target resources to enable people to avoid ill health as well as to treat its tragic consequences. That is nowhere more important than in Scotland, especially Glasgow with its high incidence of coronary disease and lung cancer, both of which are related to a high incidence of smoking and bad dietary patterns that regrettably still obtain among many people.<br><br>
I do not argue that the Greater Glasgow health board does not face substantial problems and challenges. But the amendment is not necessary because GPs will continue to have freedom. If the hon. Gentleman will grasp the reason why we want the contracts, he will see that it puts in place a system that will enable boards such as Glasgow to perform more effectively and meet the needs of patient care. The incentives that he complains about will result in better choice for the patients and better standards of care. I have no hesitation in asking the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the poorest replies that I have ever heard. The Minister normally has a little more intellectual fight than that. It was a recitation of facts that we all know. I did not say that there was anything wrong with the share formula. It is the Minister's attempt to rush through the share formula in Glasgow and Lothian that is causing their problems, so that instead of taking five or 10 years to do it with a gradual build-up of services outside Glasgow and a decrease of those inside, he is trying to do it within 18 months. As a result, it will not work and many of the best experts in Glasgow may disappear.</span></p>
<p>However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 340 is similar to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Cambell-Savours) on an earlier clause, and I endorse the arguments that he put forward.<br><br>
I once spent a night in hospital with one of my children, and it was an enlightening and, as it turned out, necessary experience. During the night my son had a drip in his arm, but the drip started to go into the arm tissue instead of into the vein. I saw that his arm was swollen and called a nurse who was able to do something about it. Once the doctor had dealt with it, I persuaded him not to put the drip back into the child's arm and he was out of hospital within 24 hours. Often parents can help doctors in their work, and therefore it is essential that they be there.<br><br>
In Scotland, the amendments relating to travel are important, because the communities are widely scattered, especially in the islands. Patients often have to go not 20 or 30 miles but 120 or 150 miles by air transport in order to travel from, say, somewhere in Barra to the Western infirmary in Glasgow. I am sure that the hon. Member for Lochaber and Skye will have more to say on that.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have overwhelming confidence in the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Forsyth) and I find his political views somewhat unacceptable. However, I should be more worried if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) were the Under-Secretary—at least with regard to travelling expenses —if he thinks that my constituency is Lochaber and Skye. I hate to think what he would to about reimbursing a patient's travel expenses there. I can only say that Ross and Cromarty will never forgive him.<br><br>
Any system of health delivery in Britain, especially in Scotland, is bound to take account of the unique geographical nature of the Highlands and islands. When MacKenzie King was Prime Minister of Canada, he remarked ruefully that the problem with his country was that it had too much geography and not enough history. The problem with the Highlands and islands is that they have more than their fair share of both.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
That is pertinent when considering travel arrangements and reimbursements.<br><br>
If one leaves the island authorities aside, the Highland health board area streches from the tip of Caithness down to Ardnamurchen point on the west coast and on the east to Speyside, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston). That is a huge area. The Scottish Home and Health Department recognises that simply to attend outpatient treatment, for instance at the Raigmore hospital in Inverness, people may have to travel distances that can run into hundreds of miles: from Caithness to Inverness, or from the west coast to Portree. That problem is not unique to the Highlands and islands—it is shared elsewhere in Scotland—but it is probably most acute there.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) represents a Highlands constituency. But as he said— and I was relieved by the admonition—his are very different Highlands from those known to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I live in a different part of the Highlands, but the Highlands of Perthshire are no different from the Highlands of Inverness. They are the same, and the Drumochter pass does not establish which side of the boundary one is on. The northern inhabitants of the Drumochter pass have enjoyed benefits and privileges that my constituents have not enjoyed, although they live in similar terrain, in similar circumstances and have similar distances to travel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I interpret that in two ways. It might be a laudable and altruistic compliment to the excellent representation that the Liberal Democrat Members in the north give their constituents. The hon. Gentleman does not seem to have met similar success for his constituents. But I have a more accurate interpretation. The hon. Gentleman's comments may be a savage attack on both the Under-Secretary and the chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland. "Yet another split rocks north Tories!" The hon. Gentleman is making a serious point. I should like to see an extension of the subsidy that goes to patients in my part of the Highlands. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the geographical problems are similar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that any of these problems have their origins in what are called the Highlands and Islands, as far as Europe is concerned. The truth of the matter is that a vast part of the Highlands is not included in that geographic area, a fact which has exercised the minds of all members of all parties for a long time. The recommendations made by the Select Committee, when I was an active member, have not been implemented partly because Europeans do not understand that the Highlands begin at the gateway at Perth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting worried by this development. I have great sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I confess that I cannot remember the specific recommendations of the Select Committee, but the essence of what the hon. Gentleman says is fair. However one defines geographically the Highlands and Islands, clearly there must be some recognition of travelling problems.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0539">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
The Minister is aware that some of my colleagues and I have had exchanges over the past year or two about what we regard as downgrading the reimbursement scheme—I accept that the evidence is somewhat anecdotal—which has had a detrimental effect and caused concern to GPs referring their patients, in particular, to Inverness.<br><br>
Under the Government's new internal market, the amount of travelling involved for patients will by definition be much greater. Therefore, not just in the Highlands and Islands but in the part of Scotland north-west of Inverness, going to another part of Scotland means Perth, which is nearest, Aberdeen or the central belt—and we are talking about substantial travelling distances to attend other major regional teaching hospitals for care that is not available in a patient's area. I hope that the Government will take a constructive attitude towards patient travelling reimbursement, because travelling will discriminate against those in the more outlying areas of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether he means every patient or only those in financial hardship?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On principle, every patient who is disadvantaged by having to travel hundreds of miles should be sympathetically classed as eligible. However, I want to hear what the Minister has to say about present arrangements and how they will be used in future. I am willing to be flexible here, and to be persuaded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to assist the hon. Gentleman when he is willing to be flexible. However, I shall deal with amendment No. 340 first.<br><br>
Amendment No. 340 expresses the perfectly sensible view that when children are being treated in hospitals there should be facilities for parents to stay overnight. We regard that as good practice although I cannot claim that it obtains in every hospital in Scotland now, but we have made a lot of progress. I share the aspirations of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy): such facilities should be available where appropriate. The appropriateness will vary, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, according to the position of the hospital and the nature of treatment being provided. I do not think that that should be written into statute but it should certainly be part of the range and quality of services considered by boards before allocating contracts. Although the hon. Gentleman's amendment is not appropriate, I entirely share the sentiment behind it.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 340, I am sure the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye will forgive me. I know that I teased him about not tabling amendments; I also know that there has been a certain amount of ribbing of the Government and that it has been suggested that we have a separate Scottish Bill. If we had a separate Scottish Bill I do not know what the hon. Gentleman would have done for amendments because he slavishly copies out the ones that are tabled on England. I regret to say that in the case of amendment No. 341 the hon. Gentleman seems to be giving a wholly new role to the Department of Health in Scottish affairs. It refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"Equal employment rights of part-time workers and such a plan has been approved by the Department of Health."</p></blockquote>
I know that the hon. Gentleman is in favour of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
devolution but I thought devolution meant transferring power northwards, not southwards. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that simply copying amendments will not work because there are differences between the two systems.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 353 and 434 concern travelling expenses, about which the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye asked me to be flexible. At this point I should reveal the secret that the hon. Gentleman did not reveal about the Highlands. Two schemes operate in the United Kingdom for travel expenses for patients, and one is absolutely unique to the Highlands. I should have thought that as the hon. Gentleman represents a Highland seat he would be proud to boast about the scheme that operates in the Highlands.<br><br>
The first scheme, which applies to the United Kingdom as a whole, provides for people on low incomes who are unable to meet travelling expenses to be given support and help in the normal way. But, uniquely, in the Highlands all patients who have to travel more than 30 miles by land or five miles by sea are given help with their travelling expenses, regardless of their income or financial means. However, if they are above the income support level they make a contribution of £5 towards the cost. The hon. Gentleman was criticising me because we recently changed the rules to enable people to claim only the actual cost incurred in travel, as opposed to a mileage payment.<br><br>
By any standards, a generous scheme applies to the hon. Gentleman's constituency and to the Highlands. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) complained that it did not apply to his constituency, which is very rural. He could have pointed out that it did not apply to my constituency, which is also very rural. I would have thought that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye would have acknowledged that a very generous scheme applies in the Highlands. Further, both schemes will continue.<br><br>
It is wrong of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that people will have to travel long distances to obtain treatment. The Bill will not result in that. It will mean that patients will obtain most treatment locally. However, they will have greater choice, and if they wish to exercise that choice the two schemes that operate in the hon. Gentleman's constituency will be available to them in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek to elicit information from the Minister. He talks about greater choice but in the rural Highlands, the Borders or in parts of Aberdeenshire or wherever, on a practical level I do not see how the legislation can provide more consumer choice. For example, the range of facilities available at the only major hospital in my part of the north of the country, Raigmore in Inverness, are defined; but any further options for patients will mean traveling to Perth, Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow or Edinburgh. In many rural areas there is not the choice that the Minister suggests, and, practically, there cannot be. I cannot see how the Bill can alter that basic reality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that at Raigmore there is a broad range of services, and there is no intention of changing them. I do not see the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Nothing is changed by the Bill. Doctors who are unable to obtain the services they require for their patients—cardiac surgery, for instance at Raigmore can refer them to the expanded services that we are providing at Aberdeen, Glasgow or Edinburgh. That choice is open to them and the travelling expenses schemes will operate under the rules as they stand.<br><br>
When I visited Raigmore and met some of the consultants, I had occasion to reprimand them a little. One of the points which they made was that everyone would have to leave Raigmore to find services outside the area. The thought had not crossed their minds that the ability to make contracts with boards will provide opportunities to expand services in Inverness and to attract patients from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, with the funds following those patients. Why does the hon. Gentleman assume that the travel will be only one way, when it will be in the direction of the best quality of patient care?<br><br>
I shall give the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye an example from his constituency. I think that Golspie is in his constituency.—<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is even further north—in the constituency of the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan). I remember meeting one of the first patients who was treated for a hip joint under our waiting list initiative at a private hospital in Glasgow. That gentleman from Golspie told me that if he had waited for treatment at Raigmore, he would have had to wait two years. He was treated immediately under the waiting list initiative. I asked him "Did you mind making the journey?" He said, "Certainly not". I said, "Do you mind being in a private hospital?" He replied, "Certainly not—it is very nice, and we have been well looked after". When I asked his opinion of the waiting list initiative, he replied, "So far as I am concerned, I am out of pain more rapidly than would otherwise have been the case".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder about the consultant's waiting list at his own hospital somewhere in Glasgow if he can carry out an operation so quickly in a private hospital.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The consultant who carried out the operation would have performed his NHS obligations and been remunerated accordingly. When the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) —I regret that he is not present—was asked by a television commentator whether he objected to patients being treated in that way, he replied, "No", so I hope that there is no division within the Labour party about the merits of providing quicker treatment and choice for patients. The possibility of choice will benefit patients, however far they have to travel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that I had not made myself clear, and it was a fair criticism. Of course there will be two-way traffic, with patients going out of the Highlands as well as being attracted into the Highlands; it need not be one-way traffic. But that may be a reflection of the historic Highland outlook on life: everything involves a flow of people out of the Highlands, with not very much in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Except more recently.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.<br><br>
The point that I wished to make was precisely what the Minister said. Whether Raigmore succeeds in attracting people from other parts of Scotland for operations, or whether people are referred elsewhere in Scotland from Raigmore, the money will follow the patient. The emphasis is on being successful in attracting patients and the revenue that comes with them. By definition, therefore, for the scheme to succeed within the Government's parameters will involve more people travelling greater distances. That is the simple point that I was making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that the effect of the Government's proposals is that patients will have wider choices and will exercise those choices. That is why he says that more people will be travelling about. If the hon. Gentleman is so convinced of that, why does he oppose a measure that will clearly be in the interests of his constituents? If he says, "I recognise that advantage, but will my constituents be disadvantaged because they will not be able to claim the travelling expenses?", I can tell him that the United Kingdom system of remuneration of travelling expenses will continue to apply, and that those of his constituents who live in the Highlands area will continue, uniquely, to benefit from the most generous support system in the Health Service.<br><br>
For all those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Cathcart will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister has been looking long and hard for a small flaw in the armour. I have to give him credit, although it should perhaps go to his advisers, for having read the amendment carefully enough to find one flaw. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I am aware that the usual channels have worked out a form of timetable for the Bill, that we are supposed to move elsewhere, and that it is essential that we make some progress. Equally, I am aware of the great concern about the Bill in Scotland, especially as it provides for changes in the Scottish Health Service that no one there sought, whether they be members of the medical profession, patients or the General Public.<br><br>
Their great anxiety is about standards and how we ensure that they are maintained in the new internal market system that the Government insist on imposing on the Scottish Health Service. Rather than speak specifically to the amendments I will make one or two general points about the quality of the Health Service.<br><br>
When I spoke earlier of privatised services, especially in the Greater Glasgow health authority area, I was well aware that the health boards did not require this legislative framework to privatise their services. I accept that all this is about contracting within health boards and Health Service organisations. Nevertheless, we can examine the records and the proposals for privatisation in Greater Glasgow to see whether the quality of service has been maintained and say, "If tht is the record, what is the future?" That is the usual way to judge the progress of an organisation—to examine the past track record and ask, "What will they do next?". We judge their proposals on the basis of their track record. That is the normal way of proceeding. I am sure that Conservative Members who are business men would do that if they were considering acquiring a company, and we are entitled to do the same in relation to the privatisation of these services.<br><br>
I accept that Greater Glasgow has saved some money on privatisated services, but it has been at the expense of quality and at the expense of the staff and workers. I heard of porters in the Western infirmary waking patients who lay on trolleys to ask them where the X-ray department was. One porter, when asked why he did the job for £50 per week, replied, "I am here for as short a time as possible—if a person is unemployed, it is difficult to get a job but if one is in a job, it is much easier to get another one thereafter." He was there purely for that reason.<br><br>
The quality of Glasgow's privatised service has declined. We must now ask, "Is not that what will happen under the so-called internal market? Is not the establishment of the internal market the first step towards a broadening of that, to bring more and more private services into the medical areas of the Health Service? Glasgow is doing just that. Already, X-ray departments have been considered for privatisation, as have laboratory services.<br><br>
So, too, are the pharmaceutical departments. How much further do we go down the road to the point where the medical Health Service is privatised. We shall come to that question when we debate the issue of opt-out hospitals, but I am sure that that is the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
privatisation that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) seeks. As for quality of service, I am reminded of the doctor who told me that when he faces a patient, he does not wish to have the cost of the operation on his mind and wonder whether his income will be affected, whether he can afford to carry out the operation or whether it is one that he must do to preserve his unit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman thinks that no doctor in Scotland does not consider the cost of what he is doing. I have a different view. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that there are doctors who believe that they must do what is right for the patient. Cost does not come to mind, but where there are options and they can treat people less expensively and still achieve results, many will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel a little like the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). There comes a point in any organisation where cost is a factor to be taken into account. It should not, however, be the job of an individual doctor to make that decision and have to worry about it. It is someone else's responsibility. Doctors should be left free to make a clinical judgment. That is how they should operate.<br><br>
I am worried that the philosophy of the Government's policies is that cost is the first factor to be thought about and that only thereafter, when cost and afford-ability have been considered, can other factors be admitted.<br><br>
The Minister shakes his head. We know of his admiration for the American system, which is based on cash, where cash comes first—whether it be the doctor's private income or the cost of running public hospitals. After that comes quality. Any doctor who has been to America will confirm that. We want a service that is based upon quality first, one which ensures that patients have the Health Service that they need. That does not mean that we do not want improvements, but many that the Health Service requires will not be introduced as a result of cash limits or the restraints that the Government are putting on the Health Service. The requirement is more spending to ensure that an efficient service is given at the point at which patients require it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'> (Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendment No. 347. I hope that Scottish Members will not mind an English Member intruding in their debate.<br><br>
In the working paper "Funding and Contracts for Hospital Services', the Government make it clear that quality will be a key aspect of contracts. Part of the concept of putting work out to contract is the use of the market mechanism to improve standards. Amendment No. 347 would enable the Secretary of State, by regulation, to specify minimum standards for goods and services. I see this as part of the Government's drive to ensure that as we move to the contract system we do not validate existing standards between provider and purchaser where standards are not as high as the Minister wishes. Amendment No. 347 seeks to include in the bill the philosophy that underpins the concept of contract provision. It would ensure that we take the opportunity to raise standards in the Health Service and to obtain good value for money.</span></p>

<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the sentiments behind the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). I agree with him that the emphasis should be on quality and improving standards, but the amendment would not produce the result that he seeks. It would be difficult, given the diverse nature of health care provision in Scotland, to define centrally the criteria that could apply. I would be reluctant to accept the amendment, even if it could achieve the result that it seeks, because the purpose of the Bill to utilise the opportunity for diversity and entrepreneurial development within the service. If we were to set standards, they might be seen as minimum standards. The Bill seeks to raise standards, not to establish norms. What might be acceptable as a minimum standard in one part of Scotland might not be acceptable in another with different needs and demands. I cannot accept the amendment but I appreciate the thinking behind it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 345, tabled by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), would require the Secretary for State to collate and disseminate information on the cost and quality of the Health Service in every contract in the NHS. That would be a huge paper chase, a bureaucratic nightmare, yet the hon. Gentleman believes that the Bill as drafted would add to administrative costs. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Gentleman is saying that he does not believe that the Bill will add to administrative costs, I shall be happy to withdraw that statement. I understand that that was his party's position and that, as a Front Bench spokesman, the hon. Gentleman would support it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman argued earlier that he was opposed to contracts and that he could see no reason for them. Now he wishes an army of bureaucrats to comb through the contracts and to collate them centrally. That would not be a sensible use of resources or of time.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Cathcart that it is important for patient care to be monitored and that standards should constantly be improved. Local health councils and boards will have a role to play in achieving that aim which should not be judged at the centre. I am no centrist: I believe in the devolution of responsibility to the level at which decisions are taken. I believe in moving decisions away from politicians into the hands of those who are involved in providing patient care. In that respect, I differ from the hon. Gentleman. That is why I support the Bill and he does not. I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg leave to move amendment No. 439, in page 25, line 5, after 'party' insert
<br><blockquote><p>'or a patient seeking or receiving care under the arrangement".</p></blockquote>
Having considered clause 27(5)(a) and (b), I believe that there is a case for the individual patient having a direct right of appeal to the Secretary of State if there is a feeling that either unfairness or an injustice arising from the relative strength of bargaining positions means that the individual patient is losing out. There
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
appears to be a deficiency here. Although it will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say, there does not appear to be an in-built specified guarantee for the individual to enjoy a direct right of appeal. It exists for health boards but not for individual patients.<br><br>
It is worth moving this probing amendment merely to obtain clarification from the Minister of the rights that the individual patient has in such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a helpful probing amendment from the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) because I can draw his attention, and the Committee's to what subsection (5) means. The hon. Gentleman suggested that the patient should be involved. Obviously there is confusion in his mind about the process to which this relates. The provisions are designed for disputes between parties on contracts that a health board wishes to make for the provision of patient services, and for such matters to be referred to the Secretary of State. We expect that to be rare because it is more sensible for disputes to be resolved by the parties.<br><br>
Discussions that might result in a dispute will take place long before the patient appears on the scene. The discussions will be about whether health board A wishes hospital X to provide a particular service, at what price and to what quality. That happens long before the service is to be provided. Therefore, the patient is not on the scene and has no locus. It is not a procedure for disputes about the quality of service, it is for the arrangements in the contract between the parties. There is no role for the patient. The appropriate way for complaints to be made about the provision of hospital services, or a GP, is through the normal complaints system within the Health Service.<br><br>
One of the things that we want to do in Scotland, in line with the changes that we announced for the health councils, is strengthen the role of the consumer voice within the service through that mechanism, which does not relate to the subsection. If that helps the hon. Gentleman, I urge him to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful clarification. I accept that in this section the patient has not swum into focus. The reason behind the amendment is that circumstances could arise in which the original nature of the contract, or some deficiency therein, does not come to light at the time the contract is agreed. Those circumstances may come to light only when problems stemming from the contract arise at the time of a patient's course of treatment. That patient may wish to have direct input, or point out a deficiency in the agreed contract.<br><br>
I am not pushing the point, but if the Minister can clarify the position I shall certainly withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was trying to compress the answer too far. The hon. Gentleman is right to argue that the procedure could be used where, for example, it was thought that a health board or a hospital used its position unfairly, or its bargaining position in a way that was prejudicial to the interests of the health board or its patients. That may indeed be the subject of a dispute that might end up with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0543">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
Secretary of State under these provisions.<br><br>
Also, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will be delighted to learn, there is the possibility that when a GP wishes to send a patient to a hospital without a contract and has no time to arrange one. Alternatively, a dispute could arise about the terms of a contract that involved only one patient. However, I do not think that is what is behind the hon. Gentlman's amendment, which would raise wider issues.<br><br>
I do not envisage a problem but perhaps in the conduct of a contract, as a result of the experience of one patient, some unfairness might come to light. However, the procedure will allow for that. The Bill does not need to be amended to provide for such an eventuality.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman thought that this was a complaints procedure, that is not its purpose and I do not believe it would be the appropriate way in which to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that further response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman standing comfortably?</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am, Dame Janet. It will now be difficult for anyone to rush out to answer the call of "Division". It is a cunning ploy to make sure that the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) hears the whole of my speech.<br><br>
The self-governing trusts in the clause are more commonly known by another term. I am well aware that Conservative Members are rather sensitive about that common term; it is, of course, opted-out hospitals. It was possibly I who first applied the term "opt out" to hospitals, and I did so in the pre-launch publicity with which I assisted the White Paper on its way. That night, when I was thinking about how I would describe these hospitals the following day, I confess that I did not hit on the term "opted out hospitals" with any thought at the back of my mind that it would provide a cunning misrepresentation of what they were. I shall not disguise from the Committee the fact that from time to time my staff and I apply our minds to the language that we may use to put the best possible spin on what we are about to say—or, from the Government's point of view, the worst possible spin. But on that occasion, I have to say in all genuineness and candour that we saw the words "opt out" as an objective way of describing exactly what these hospitals would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0544">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
be, and when we read the Bill a year after those events, everything about the hospitals in the Bill confirms how apt was our choice of term.<br><br>
What are these hospitals? They are hospitals that will not be managed by the local DHA. To that extent, they have certainly opted out of the NHS; they have opted out of management by the DHA. They are to be managed by a board of management. Such a board is far more powerful than a managerial committee. It will own the hospital, and it can sell bits of the hospital and the sites attached to it. It will hire all the staff who work in the hospital, and along with the power to hire them, it has the power to fire them. It will not be bound by national or local district agreements on wages or conditions of staff working in the hospital sector. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members express enthusiasm for the proposition. Without debating whether it is a sound proposition, I put it to them that their enthusiasm about a clear break with the rest of the NHS confirms how right we are to stress the concept of opt out. These hospitals will opt out of national pay bargaining and national wage negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'> (Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) for giving way. He is, of course, an honourable Member and an honourable person, and I am sure that he will take the opportunity of confirming to those who follow our debates that when he uses the term "opt out", he does not seek to imply that hospitals will opt out of the NHS, because of course they will not do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Gentleman is making an assertion, and it is precisely that assertion that we are debating in the clause.<br><br>
Opt-out hospitals will not be managed by the DHAs, which are responsible for the local health service. They will own their own hospitals. They will be able to sell them, hire and fire staff and negotiate wages. They will be able to go to the City, bypassing the Treasury and the Department of Health, and raise money. In the course of each financial year they will be able to make profits, which are described in the White Paper not as profits but in the rather more discreet and less loaded term of surpluses. Nevertheless, they will have the power to make and retain surpluses year on year.<br><br>
Having described a hospital with that structure of management and degree of self-control, it is impossible to distinguish it from the private Nuffield and BUPA hospitals, or even to slip a playing card between them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'> (Daventry)</span></span>
<span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) consider the issue from the patient's point of view? Will he tell the Committee whether hospitals will continue to be financed predominantly from public funds and whether patients of those hospitals being treated under the NHS will have to pay? The hon. Gentleman knows that they will continue to be financed from public funds and that patients will not have to pay anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will be financed from public funds only to the extent that they attract contracts from DHAs. They will compete on the same terms as the Nuffield and BUPA hospitals for public funds. I waded through the prospectuses—mission statements as some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
are grandly titled—of the hospitals that expressed an interest in forming an NHS trust. Half stated that it would be an opportunity for them to expand private patient care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The unit general manager of the Freeman hospital in Newcastle is a leading light among those who express an interest in opting out. He said that he intends to use the Freeman hospital's facilities to undercut private hospitals and get more private patients—possibly at the expense of NHS patients.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that unit general manager will see a video of our proceedings. He attended a meeting that I held in Newcastle, and subsequently told staff that I agreed with 90 per cent. of the Government's proposals. I was clearly not as lucid on that occasion as I usually try to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An NHS trust could be compared to a defence contractor whose main business may, by public procurement, be with the Government. The sole market for some defence contractors is the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that there are defence contractors whose sole client is the Ministry of Defence. I suspect that the sole client of those hospitals that opt out will not be the Department of Health and the local DHA.<br><br>
Whatever they may provide in future, hospitals that opt out of a planned public service in which they receive capital and revenue allocation on a planned, managed basis are entering a commercial environment in which the bulk of the funds come from their commercial success. Whether that is described as opting out or as creating a trust, it does not conceal the fact that the clause makes fundamental changes in the nature of those hospitals. Ministers say that the changes are merely a shift in managerial arrangements, but they are not. They change the structure, accountability and objectives of the hospitals.<br><br>
Who should decide whether those fundamental changes take place? The Secretary of State is not in the Committee at present—I understand that he has other things to do. If he is spending his time solving the ambulance dispute, I shall not criticise him. He says that he wants local people to take local decisions. In a press release last February, he said that his proposals will
<br><blockquote><p>"give local people more ability to take the big decisions in their part of the service."</p></blockquote>
What decision could be bigger than whether the local hospital forms an NHS trust? I avoid using the wording that distresses hon. Gentlemen.<br><br>
How does clause 5 provide for local people to be involved in that big decision? Characteristically, clause 5 opens with the words "The Secretary of State". Subsection (5) begins:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order establish bodies, to be known as National Health Service trusts".</p></blockquote>
Clearly it is the Secretary of State alone who makes the decision.<br><br>
Subsection (2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every NHS trust—shall be a body corporate having a board of directors consisting of a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State'".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
Subsection (3) beings:
<br><blockquote><p> "The functions specified in an order under subsection (1) above shall include such functions as the Secretary of State considers appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (4) reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations make general provision with respect to"</p></blockquote>
The chairman's qualifications and the tenure of office of the chairman and directors of an NHS trust. The following five paragraphs provide for the Secretary of State to make regulations on the chairman's qualifications down to the appointment of sub-committees of the trust.<br><br>
Subsection (7) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument confer on NHS trusts specific powers additional to those contained in paragraphs 10 to 15 of Schedule 2".</p></blockquote>
There are five separate references to the Secretary of State having more powers, but not one reference to local people, hospital staff or patients whom the hospital services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'> (Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman works himself into a froth over references to the Secretary of State, perhaps he will come clean and tell the Committee who makes the decisions on far more serious issues such as the closure of a hospital, and whether local people are consulted. Let him talk about the present arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are statutory arrangements for consultation on the closure of a hospital, or a ward, which involve specific consultation with the CHC. The hon. Gentleman is correct. In the end, it comes back to the Secretary of State, but only after a decision by the DHA, which will have consulted the CHC in the process of local consultation. Only then does the matter go to the Secretary of State as final arbiter between the DHA and local people. As I said on Second Reading, a bizarre feature of the Bill's structure is that no consultation is required before an NHS trust is created but consultation is provided for in a schedule before a trust can be wound up and brought back into the DHA which appears to be at least lopsided.<br><br>
In an attempt to establish what the clause means, 1 have tried to read "Self-governing Hospitals Working Paper 1", which runs to 24 pages. I shall save my hon. Friends the labour of going through them by saying that there is not one reference to consultation with staff, the public or even CHCs before an NHS trust is created. Three paragraphs are headed "Accountability". All three, characteristically, are about financial accountability. There is no mention of democratic accountability to local electors or the patients of the hospital service.<br><br>
Our problem is that, curiously, the Bill does not appear to give effect to the intentions of the Secretary of State. The right hon. and learned Gentleman keeps assuring us that he wants local people to make local decisions. Given that he has somehow failed to provide for that in the Bill, no doubt through malign and inadequate advice received during its construction which has failed to put his intentions into legislative form, we have, in a helpful spirit, prepared amendments that would give effect to what the Secretary of State assures us he wishes to achieve—the involvement of local people.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
We invite Ministers to attempt a multiple choice question. We have included a range of options for consultation. Amendment No. 33—our preferred amendment—proposes a ballot of the local community within the local hospital's catchment area. That was the specific recommendation of the Select Committee which reported last summer. The second alternative, amendment No. 34, would provide for a ballot of all staff at hospitals. If Ministers find that unacceptable, amendment No. 35 would provide for a ballot of hospital consultants. I have reservations about confining consultations to consultants, but we give the Ministers that option if they are unable to extend it to all staff. If all three are unacceptable to Ministers, we have the minimal request that before a hospital is allowed to access itself as a self-governing trust, this course should be approved by a local DHA. That would end the present farcical situation — <i>[Interruption.]</i>. The Minister for Health may well laugh at it. I know of three districts—North Tyneside, West Lambeth and Doncaster—where the DHA has voted against any hospital expressing an interest in opting out and in each of which there are still hospitals on the list, which is constantly produced by the Secretary of State, that the right hon. and learned Gentleman might allow to form an NHS trust. Those DHAs consist, though not for long, of local people taking the big decisions that affect their community, and once again they are being ignored.<br><br>

Ministers can take whichever amendment they find most acceptable. They cannot argue that none of them provides for acceptable consultation. One of them must be acceptable even to them.<br><br>
I hope that we do not hear the argument that it is not practicable to conduct ballots or consult the people affected. Several such ballots have been carried out, and we have the results. There was a ballot of the staff of St. George's hospital in Stafford, a politically interesting location. There may be opportunities within the next couple of months to make many references to the views of staff at that hospital. Of those staff, 33 voted yes to an NHS trust, and 474 voted no— those are staff, not percentages.<br><br>
There was a ballot at Nottingham University hospital, which serves the constituency of the Secretary of State for Health. The staff voted: yes, 42; no, 1,384. There was a ballot at the Royal Scottish National hospital in Larbert, which caters solely for long-stay, severely mentally-handicapped people. It has been thrust to the forefront of the drive to opt-out in Scotland and is the only major hospital in Scotland to have expressed an interest. Mi hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and I, and all our Scottish colleagues, find it repugnant that patients who are unable to speak for themselves, unable to write letters to the newspapers and unable to take part in demonstrations, are being used as guinea pigs for an ideological experiment. The staff at that hospital carried out a ballot on opting out and creating an NHS trust, and voted yes, 34; no. 802. Those are ballots of the entire staff in each hospital.<br><br>
These are also ballots solely aimed at consultants within hospitals that express an interest. Again, ballots conducted of all consultants have repeatedly thrown up

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
heavy majorities against NHS trusts. At Aberdeen, 80 per cent. voted against setting up an NHS trust. At Plymouth, 75 per cent. voted against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Couchman <span class='memberconstituency'> (Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's figures are impressive, but he has not told us the circumstances of the ballots and the precise questions put to those who voted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a fair point. For the results to be standardised, they have to be achieved by the same methodology, and the same question has to be asked on each occasion. That is precisely why we seek to ensure that the clause contains a statutory provision for ballots to be conducted independently and on an open basis. I cheerfully admit that, the ballots that I have cited, have been by their very nature, amateur and voluntarily arranged, because there is no statutory provision for them. If the hon. Gentleman really thinks that the phrasing of the question has produced those dramatic, amazing majorities, I invite him to frame any question that he chooses about NHS cuts and to try it out on the staff of any NHS hospital that he cares to nominate. Then we should see whether he can get a result that supports the proposition to the same degree that these results show opposition to it.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's comments on the importance of consulting staff are worth recalling. There is a staff communications video in which the Secretary of State speaks to camera for seven minutes. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe the best decisions on local services are the ones made by doctors, nurses and managers who have first-hand knowledge of the needs of local people."</p></blockquote>
These are all decisions made by doctors, nurses, and—where they chose to participate in the ballot-managers. As the Secretary of State put it, they have knowledge of the needs of local people. They have, without exception, concluded that the needs of local people are better served within the DHA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day <span class='memberconstituency'> (Cheadle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must expand a little on some points that the hon. Gentleman made about the ballots. It is all very well to state that the question was the same everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that it was consistent at least. There are two points that I wish him to cover. First, who organised these so-called voluntary ballots? Secondly, what background information was given? That was the basis on which people made their decision. Were they told that the hospitals would opt out of the NHS? If they were told, I am not surprised at the ballot's result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has either misheard or misunderstood what I said in reply to the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman). I did not say that it was a standard question or that it was the same methodology. On the contrary. One of the reasons for my anxiety is that the ballots were conducted on different questions and on a different basis. All that they had in common was the fact that they were organised by hospital staff, although the circumstances differed from hospital to hospital and the definition of "staff varied as well. That is why we want a statutory basis for such ballots.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
If the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) is saying that the reasons why those balloted voted by 10:1 or 20:1 against was that they were asked the wrong question and that the ballots were badly organised, let him vote for our amendment. The ballots would then have a proper statutory basis, and we would then see who wins. If the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to do that, he cannot shelter behind the defence that had the ballot been properly organised there would have been a different result.<br><br>
There have also been referendums of the wider public. They have been carried out in York, in the east midlands and, most notably, in Redditch, where the borough council provided a ballot form for every household. There were 31,000 votes cast, with 17 per cent, voting in favour of the local hospitals forming an NHS trust, and 73 per cent, against.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must persist with my question. That referendum was a major test of opinion. Will the hon. Member please read the question that was asked of the many households that voted in it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have anticipated the hon. Gentleman's question, and I have the question with me: It was:
<br><blockquote><p>"How would you describe your attitude to the possibility of Alexandra Hospital 'opting out' of local health authority control and becoming self-governing?"</p></blockquote>
I should find it difficult to devise an intelligible question which was more objective than that, and it produced a 73 per cent. to 17 per cent. result. If Conservative Members pretend that the result was due to the words "opting out", even though those words were within inverted commas, I invite them to devise their own fair and objective question and to ballot members of the public in their own constituencies, from door to door, as the Redditch borough council did.<br><br>
It is difficult to believe that the result was a consequence of a misleading leaflet. During a debate in the House, the Secretary of State said that the Redditch borough council had circulated a misleading leaflet. My opponents have circulated misleading leaflets in evey general election that I have fought since 1970. It is part of the cut and thrust of politics and one has to live with the results, as I had to in 1970 when I did not even win the election. That is the nature of democratic consultation. The Government have spent £2 million over the past year to promote their White Paper, and it ill befits Conservative Members to complain that a misleading leaflet in Redditch caused the referendum result.<br><br>
I shall respond to the argument that the ballot was conducted by people who were not properly qualified, and who may not have had a suitable professional background to enable them to judge the results. Opinion polls have been carried out by reputable and professional organisations which depend entirely on commercial contracts for their survival. To my knowledge, MORI has carried out two opinion polls on the subject, and on neither occasion did it circulate leaflets, misleading or otherwise. One, carried out for Doncaster district council, resulted in only 13 percent. of those polled supporting the opting out of the two Doncaster hospitals that had expressed an interest in it, with 68 per cent. objecting. The other opinion poll was carried out at the request of the Labour party, and the results were similar to those from Doncaster.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a national sample.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opinion polls often give the wrong message. The hon. Gentleman will recollect the opinion poll in Scotland before the referendum on the Scotland Act. Due to his advocacy and that of others, the final result did not reflect the opinion polls. People viewed things differently once they knew all the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is terrific. The hon. Gentleman has made a fair point. I agree with him for once, and am excited to find common ground. Opinion poll results before the cut and thrust of a campaign, with its exchange of views and misleading leaflets, can be very differnet from the results at the end. That is why we want a campaign, followed by a vote on whether hospitals should opt out. That is what the amendments propose. If the hon. Gentleman believes that by such a process he can turn the votes around, he should vote for our amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands my argument. I believe that Parliament should make the decisions. A referendum would not be helpful in my constituency, where there is an interest in self-governing hospitals and the possibility of a second one being set up. I want a voluntary approach whereby things happen because people want them to.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Gentleman introduces an important cornerstone of our constitution, which is that Parliament should make the decisions. I accept that that is the cornerstone of major strategic political decisions. But rests on the keystone that parties that seek to be returned to Government should tell the electors during the election what they intend to do. The Bill has a mandate, which is precisely why it is important that we ask the public to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When there was a Labour Government in 1976, the hospital building programme was cut by 30 per cent. That was not in Labour's 1974 manifesto but the public did not vote on it. Is not the hon. Gentleman being rather selective in what he thinks there should be votes on? Why did not the Labour Party propose a vote on hospital closures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point has been repeatedly put to me on the Floor of the House. After the second time that it was raised I checked the figures. It is true that capital expenditure was cut below the projection as a result of the 1976 package. It is true also that capital expenditure for 1979, when the Conservatives came into office, was higher than that for 1973.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have answered by saying that the hon. Gentleman's question relies on a spurious premise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no mandate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me to revise the debates of 15 years ago. I think that that would test the limits of your tolerance. Dame Janet. There were people in 1975 and 1976 who said that the Labour Government did not have a mandate for their financial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
measures. If we had been supported by the hon. Gentleman's colleagues in the House at the time, closures would not have happened.<br><br>
I shall refer to the figures which I expect will be of interest to Conservative Committee members. The opinion poll was part of the monthly omnibus and therefore had a large enough sample to derive accurate statistics by party affiliation. One of the questions that it asked was:
<br><blockquote><p>"If your local hospital decided that it wanted to opt for self-governing status, do you think that local people should or should not be given a vote?"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hospitals would remain within the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, within the NHS with additional funding and with more sunshine! I understand why the hon. Gentleman is desperately casting around.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There have been too many seated interjections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand those seated interjections and why they have a rising note of desperation. The words "opt-out" are not there, but the Minister's chosen phrase, "self-governing" trust are. The poll contained everything needed to make a fair assessment. It showed that 76 per cent. of Conservatives voters supported the proposition that there should be a vote and only 17 per cent. opposed it. Conservative Members do not even represent their own supporters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question that the hon. Member quotes does not say that a self-governing or NHS trust hospital will remain within the NHS and give health care services on precisely the present terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those hospitals will patently not provide NHS care on precisely the same terms. All of our debates over the past three weeks have been about the new terms and the way in which services will be provided on the basis of commercial contracts. If the question were amended to read, "If your local hospital decided that it wanted to opt for self-governing status and seek National Health Service funds through contracts", I would not object, and I should be interested to know whether MORI would produce a different result.<br><br>
The Department of Health's documents on opting out from self-governing trusts repeatedly stress that there must be no ballots. I have with me the minutes of the meeting of the regional co-ordinators for self-governing units—which is interesting, since there are no self-governing units at present but apparently regional co-ordinators for them—held on 28 September at Richmond House. Paragraph 6.2 of the minutes, headed "Consultation",<br><br>
"No ballots." Paragraph 6.3 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"D.H. to issue guidance on consultation process for Trust applications within the next few weeks".</p></blockquote>
That is fascinating. It goes on:<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>guidance will be minimal and will reinforce message about no ballots".</p></blockquote>
So we do not know what room will be left in this minimal guidance after that stress, but plainly "No ballots", will be repeated.<br><br>
Paragraph 6.4, which is prefaced, "Off the record".
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
says: "SGT"—self-governing trust—
<br><blockquote><p>"consultation requirements unlikely to be treated as 'service' change to avoid leap-frogging effects of current consultation requirements".</p></blockquote>
In other words, not only are there to be no consultations on creating self-governing trusts, they are to be exempt, if you please, from the existing arrangements for consultation over closure. Why? We know the answer, of course. The reason why the guidance about no ballots will be stressed is that the Government are terrified of the result.<br><br>
This measure has no mandate. It resulted in a White Paper written with no consultation and a Bill in which there is no provision for consultation. The Secretary of State knows that the only place where he can get a majority vote for the self-governing trusts is in Westminster, and he therefore hopes to go behind the closed door, light a cigar and make the decision all by himself, without, as we read in the press, even allowing his PPS to attend these private meetings. This Committee should not let him get away with it. The Health Service is the most important public service to our constituents. It belongs to the public, and it must be the public who decides what happens to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a good month to be debating this matter because January is named after the god Janus who faced both ways, and the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) is looking, as his colleagues constantly do, in both directions. When it suits them, they berate the Government endlessly for ills which have befallen the National Health Service—imagined ills in many cases—and when it is pointed out to them that those ills are an integral part of the way in which the National Health Service is currently run and that the Bill is intended to alter that for the better, they say that all the proposals in the Bill are disgraceful and that the present system works pretty well, and they wonder why they made so much fuss.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Livington is only partially accurate. There is nothing in the Bill, as I read it, which confines NHS trusts to hospitals alone, and I have little doubt that a range of proposals will be put forward with a variety of management proposals which I think will enormously assist a monolithic service which has become too large for effective management.<br><br>
One of the NHS's great problems at present is that contracts are often held at a different level from the level which is supposed to manage the holders of them. The Opposition constantly pretend that somehow these NHS reforms have sprung fully armed out of the Secretary of State's head, with no background whatever. But they are a response to a long succession of anxieties about how the present system works. One is that DHAs have constantly complained that it is difficult to discipline consultants or maintain mangement control over them when their contracts are held by the region. A NHS trust, with its ability to control, will tell a different story.<br><br>
In my part of the country, the differences in regional pay and terms and conditions of service for most staff outside the NHS are creating serious problems. There is much to be said for experimenting in several NHS trusts which can hire and fire and determine rates of pay.<br><br>
One other great problem in the current DHA set-up
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
about which we constantly hear is that DHA staff find it frustrating and difficult when they make savings through their own efficiency only to find that the savings are swallowed up by the RHA and do not benefit their patients or unit. A NHS trust which can make its own decisions will be able to reward staff or units by returning to them the value of some of the savings to enable them to improve the running of their unit.<br><br>
The present RHA system means that there is guessing, second-guessing, second-second-guessing and even second-second-second-guessing when property that is surplus to requirements comes up for sale. I believe it to be true, although I should not like to be quoted on the figure, that 100 properties or more currently in the hands of the South East Thames Regional Health Authority could have been sold to the benefit of patients; but they have not been sold because it took so long to go through the valuation, revaluation and re-valuation process that we are now in the midst of a property slump and it would be foolish to sell any of them. Therefore, patient care has again suffered. NHS trusts, which could control their own property, would be entirely appropriate.<br><br>
There seems to be a distrust of large-scale organisations which are non-profit-making but in some ways independent or at arms' length from DHA control. I am a council member of the Save the Children Fund. It is perhaps worth noting that that organisation, which disposes of about £50 million plus a year—in one year £84 million—has often been the preferred choice of Governments throughout the world to a body that is tightly under central Government control.<br><br>
The Secretary of State will occupy a central role in choosing how to appoint members of NHS trusts. That confirms what an integral part of the NHS the trusts will be.<br><br>
It is entirely appropriate that a service which has hitherto been a managed service and not open to ballots throughout its operation should continue to be a managed service. It is wholly appropriate that the Secretary of State should retain that management and not throw it out to a ballot, which would be an innovation in the NHS. NHS trusts will prove to be a valuable innovation in the running of this enormous and unwieldy leviathan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly to amendments Nos. 317, 323 and 315, which relate directly to consultation and local democracy in the Health Service, and especially to the threatened transition or transfiguration in many instances—if we are to believe the Government's aspirations, and I do not doubt them—to hospital trusts.</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 317 would place on the Secretary of State
<br><blockquote><p>"prior to making an order to establish a National Health Service trust"</p></blockquote>
the duty to
<br><blockquote><p>"seek approval from staff working at the hospital or other establishment"</p></blockquote>
and to
<br><blockquote><p>"seek approval from the local community"</p></blockquote>
for such a development.<br><br>

6.45pm<br><br>
The NHS was built, constructed, funded and continues to be financed from general taxation. It has been accepted by parties of all political colours since it was founded over 40 years ago as being in every sense the property and pride of the British people. It is a democratic affront that the service can be so substantially diluted, altered and, I argue, disfigured by the Bill's proposals without the involvement of those very people whose talents while working within it and whose taxes for funding it have built it up to what it is today.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe), who touched on the democratic consideration only at the end of his speech. It is entirely unacceptable for Ministers to present a measure which, as the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said, was never foreshadowed in the general election campaign. The only major campaign statement about the Health Service was the Prime Minister's famous words that it was safe in her hands. Conservative Members might argue that the Bill offers security or guarantees for the NHS, but suppose that such a proposal had been mooted during the general election campaign when, as in the one before that, the Conservative party was seen to be acutely vulnerable on the issue of the NHS. If it had been known that such proposals were liable to emerge following a re-election of the Conservatives in 1987, the myth—which they were unable to uphold—of the Health Service being safe in their hands would have been blown apart. Moreover, the credibility of the Conservative party would have been severely threatened.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not wish to mislead the Committee. He no doubt knows that in our campaign in Scotland we, the Conservatives, said that we should certainly examine how the Health Service was managed and organised. There is no question about that; I made at least 40 speeches on that topic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always blamed the poll tax for what happened to the Tories in Scotland in the previous general election. We may have just been given a further good reason why they suffered such a humiliating rebuff. If the hon. Member for Tayside. North (Mr. Walker) told 40 public meetings in Scotland that he had ideas for changing the Health Service, I can well understand why the Conservatives disappeared all but down the plug hole in that joyous event.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 1 studied the handbook published by the Conservative party entitled the "Conservative Campaign Guide 1987". Before coming to this Committee. I read the section dealing with undertakings, views and thoughts on these matters. At no point does it refer to opt-out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am for ever lost in admiration at the documentation that he absorbs. His capacity for consumption and I suspect—given the name of that document—sheer tedium, is second to none.<br><br>
The Government know that they are on extremely thin ice. One the one hand, they are stuck with their rhetoric: they argue that the measure will be a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
significant enough change to the basis on which the Health Service is founded and operated. They must argue that as part of their radical approach. On the other hand, they know that the public are anxious about change, as they always are; people are especially anxious when they perceive change to be a threat. On the one hand, it is a radical measure but, on the other. Ministers have said several times in Committee that there is no need to worry because it will not change anything in normal day-to-day working relationships. The Government cannot have it both ways.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Livingston was on the ball when he said that where conversion to a hospital trust was a possibility, it would be fair to have the issues thrashed out by means of proper consultation and, ultimately, at the ballot box, given the history of the Health Service.<br><br>
The other two amendments focus on the need for consultation and local democracy. A weakness in the proposals is that the relevant CHCs or local health councils do not enjoy an inbuilt right of consultation when there is a change to a hospital trust. Amendment No. 323 relates to that. Scant regard has been paid to local feelings and local democracy. The proposal gives the lie to the proud proclamaion of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for health that, as a politician, he was interested in taking more decisions from politicians and giving them back to local people at community level. If he favours that, he cannot be against the principle of consultation with relevant CHCs and local health councils being a duty on him or his opposite number south of the border, because it accords with what he proclaimed.<br><br>
Amendment No. 315 relates to subsection (1). It calls on the Secretary of State to publish, prior to an order being laid under the subection,
<br><blockquote><p>"a document setting out the reasons for establishing each NHS trust"</p></blockquote>
and to
<br><blockquote><p>"seek the views of the relevant community health council and any other bodies or persons he thinks appropriate"</p></blockquote>
and take those views into account.<br><br>
Surely, as an exercise in legitimate and democratic decision making, it is right that when an order is laid before the House, there should be, as an appendix, clear information about who was consulted and what was said. Only in that way can informed choices be made in Committee or on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
Much has been said about the importance of democracy and accountability, and the amendments make the issue central to consideration of the Bill. Ministers will not have a leg to stand on if they cannot respond positively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly reinforce the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe). The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) outlined why he thought it would be wrong for hospitals to become self governing. The gist of his remarks was that they would become outwith the DHA, be independent, be able to generate their own income and that their priorities might not be the same as those of the authority as a whole.<br><br>
The most successful part of the NHS is primary care and the GP unit. The unit fulfils most of the criteria
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
for a self-governing trust which the hon. Member for Livingston outlined. They are independent practitioners whose priorities might not be the same as those of the DHA. They receive their capital and revenue from the NHS. There are good ones and bad ones, and people move from one to another. I find it most odd that a style of management that is popular and successful and operates currently at GP level, which we advocate being extended to other units, should be castigated by Opposition Members.<br><br>
Two can play at the game of balance. If I went to my local GP practice and said, "Let us have a ballot on whether the practice should remain self governing" —GPs are self-governing now—"or whether you wish to remain under the DHA, become directly employed and be told what to do by the DHA", I have no doubt that everyone would vote to stay outside, to remain self governing. I take with a pinch of salt Opposition Members' arguments about trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. It is not the usual courtesy that when an hon. Member moves an amendment, he stays for the debate? Neither the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) nor the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) is present, having criticised my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for not being here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be clear that attendance is entirely a matter for hon. Members. We are working very long hours and I hope that we shall show certain courtesies to hon. Members who absent themselves at certain times.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Dame Janet. I accept your ruling. It should be said that my Hon. Friends the Members for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and for Peckham (Ms. Harman) are participating in discussions on the ambulance men's dispute. Both are worried about all aspects of the Health Service including the Bill's proposals, which are a subject for serious discussion rather than ribaldry and irrelevant points of order. Both my Hon. Friends will attend to their duties diligently. I am sure that you accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should now return to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My comments relate to amendments Nos. 34 and 315. The first of those amendments would provide for a ballot of working people in hospitals prior to decisions being made.<br><br>
The series of amendments and clause 5 take us to the squalid heart of the Government's proposals and to the concern that they have caused to the public. The Government's arrangements for consultation are detailed on page 23 of working document 1 which states.
<br><blockquote><p> "It will be for RHAs to give all proposals to seek self-governing status local publicity. They will seek the views of those with an interest, particularly the health authorities concerned, staff at the hospital, general practitioners. Community Health Councils and the local community. They will be asked to submit any responses, together with any comments they have on them, to the Secretary of State so that he can consider them alongside the application."</p></blockquote>
Despite the references of my Hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) to an instruction that ballots would not be acceptable, it is possible that that direction could give the impression that they were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
a means of consultation. Perhaps the Minister should clarify paragraph 23.<br><br>
The principle of ballots was established by a Select Committee of the House of Commons last year. While perhaps not referring to a ballot of the work force, the Select Committee, which was composed of hon. Members of all political persuasions, with a Conservative majority, stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"If this is to be a consumer-orientated revolution, as the Secretary of State claims, the first such hospitals should be set up in districts where there is only one district hospital serving that area and where customers in the district i.e. the local population, have indicated through a ballot that they support the hospital becoming self-governing."</p></blockquote>
A Conservative-controlled Committee of the House of Commons recommended the principle of balloting on the consultative process for opting out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a member of the Select Committee, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not wish to mislead the Committee. I hope that he has read the full report. If he has, he should know that although the Select Committee had a Conservative majority there was by no means a majority of Conservative Members putting their names to his proposition. I was the author, along with other Conservative Members, of a minority report which went entirely against such a proposition. In fact, only two Conservatives on the Select Committee fully supported it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sit on three Select Committees and whatever is decided by them I invariably support on the Floor of the House even when I have not accepted what has been said. The best Members of Select Committees are those who stand by majority decisions. The purpose of Select Committees is to draw a greater consensus view, particularly over controversial issues. Members are expected to stand by the decisions of Select Committees.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
The truth is that a Conservative dominated Committee voted in favour of the principle of balloting. The hon. Gentleman is seeking to dissent only to disassociate himself today from an excellent decision. My view is that there is always a case for balloting, and certainly in the areas identified by may hon. Friend the Member for Livingston.<br><br>
I want to refer to the Government's attitude towards a ballot that should have taken place at the end of this month. I understand that today the work force at Guy's hospital asked for ballot papers to be placed in the pay packets of employees, and was refused. That is interference by the hospital's administrators in the democratic right of employees to be balloted to express their views. Employees have a particular interest in such a ballot because they know that as a result of the opting-out provisions the Whitley council provisions may no longer apply. Even pay review board decisions for nurses and others shield people who work in the NHS and if they do not apply, employees should have the right to express their opinions if their terms of employment or their pay structure suffers.</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 315, which is important, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Three months prior to making an order under subsection 1 above, the Secretary of State shall:</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0551">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) publish a document setting out the reasons for establishing each NHS trust and including such detail as is required under this section."</p></blockquote>
My view is that this document should set out to establish the dangers involved in setting up a trust. To understand them, we shall have to consider the attitude of trust directors to local health provision. I intend to refer to what I believe will be the consideration of trust directors when trusts are set up. To do so, we must recognise that the new opt-out trusts will be profit-motivated enterprises. I understand that they are not private companies but fall within the general control of the NHS and that the Secretary of State can wind them up. In some ways, trusts can be likened to nationalised industries because they are required to break even or to make profits for internal investment.<br><br>
The trusts bear a clear similarity to the arrangements that exist in the United States. Perhaps Conservative Back Bench Members and Ministers may seek to draw a distinction between health provision in the United States and in the United Kingdom. My view is that if the British and Scottish systems are to be market-orientated we must examine where the distinction lies, and the only distinction between the American and British trusts systems is who pays the bill in the end. Under the British system, the taxpayer in the main will pay the bill. Under the American system, there is a variety of organisations, state contributions, private companies, insurance companies and personal contributions which pay for them. Therefore, in this country the state will pay in the main and in America it is a plethora of organisations which pay, but there will be the same market-orientated system in both countries.<br><br>
In the light of that, I want to examine what would be in the mind of the managing director of one of the trusts when negotiating contracts with the family practitioner authorities and the various other parties. Let us first take the relationship with the family doctor, who under some of the amendments, would have to be consulted. I believe that the trusts will try to influence family practitioners by way of inducement. We already have evidence that pharmaceutical companies have influenced the decisions of family practitioners by way of inducement. In so far as the very existence of the opt-out organisation is dependent on referrals from family practitioner committees, the relationship of the trust to family practitioners is critical. It is the family practitioners who will determine the success or failure of a profit-motivated enterprise.<br><br>
Furthermore, I believe that local family practitioners will be pressed to use local facilities, even where they are less effective, by the threat of reduced services if referrals are not made locally. The local media will be used. There will be articles in the local newspapers, perhaps identifying indirectly certain groups of family practitioners which are refusing to make referrals to their particular trust and are said to be jeopardising the local hospital which has opted out. Indeed, I believe that the trust will try to compromise doctors so as to ensure a steady income for it, on the basis that if referrals are not made, the future of the trust, or what is known locally as the local hospital — the enterprise, as I call it—may be placed in jeopardy.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an extraordinary phantasmagoria
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
of potential corruption, and I sometimes wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has not become caught up in his own love of corruption scandals. I am confused, because it seems to me that one result of his corrupting scenario would be local referral. The entire thrust of the argument from the Opposition has been how disgraceful the new proceedings will be because it will mean that nobody will ever be able to get any sort of treatment locally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues, I must tell him that he seems to be going rather wide of the amendments. I appreciate that he was seeking to say why ballots were important, but I do not think that we can have a general discussion on the merits or otherwise of NHS trusts at this stage. We can have one later, no doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am referring specifically to the amendment. Dame Janet, which refers to publishing a document setting out the reasons for establishing NHS trusts. I am referring to the dangers that would arise, which should be referred to in that document. Having scanned the amendment paper, I cannot see an amendment which is more applicable to my argument.<br><br>
I say to the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) that it is the Government's case that family practitioners will have the right to choose. In many cases however, their choice will be influenced by pressure from trusts and by inducement. I do not claim that all family practitioners will take inducements but if it happens in one practice in a locality it will distort the market and introduce factors that are not healthy in a national Health Service.<br><br>
Other trusts will carve up the market and fix prices to prevent poaching. For example, there is price fixing in the petroleum and pharmaceutial industries. The Health Service may have an appeal mechanism but cases must be proved. That would take a long time if the only evidence was similarity in price.<br><br>
I suspect that there will be pressure to skimp on training under the Bill, especially if the criteria are the same as those in the private sector. The National Health Service report, which was discussed by the Public Accounts Committee yesterday, stated that the independent sector makes almost no provision for the training of nurses and other hospital staff. The onus is therefore on the Government to prove that that will not happen in the NHS.<br><br>
Let us consider cash-flow investment under the Bill. If pressure is exerted by forceful consultants for special facilities, cuts will be made within the service to secure the money that is required. The cuts might be made within the terms of a contract which contained what some might deem frills, which can then be removed. Powerful hospital consultants—we know that they exist—will be able to determine investment.<br><br>
The overriding consideration will be to jig the contract to maximise profit and revenue and minimise services. Commercial considerations will determine the nature of the surplus and the extent of the profit.<br><br>
The amendments identify the work force and I take as an example the nurses. It is possible that in some trusts—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments and he is not keeping to a sufficiently narrow discussion of the amendments. I cannot allow a general discussion on the merits of NHS trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments, Dame Janet, provide for consultation with groups of people—for example CHCs, the work force and the local population—by means of a ballot. The attitude of a trust to its work force would be taken into account by the staff in registering their votes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. That is what I want the hon. Gentleman to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nurses may discover that their pay will not rise in line with pay in other parts of the country or with inflation. We do not know whether the pay review board will determine nurses' pay indefinitely. The link may be breached: The Whitley Council is going out of the window so why should we believe that the pay review board will determine nurses' pay in the long term? Nurses in areas where wages are deflated may need to accept lower rates of pay than those that are accepted by nurses in other parts of the country. Conservative Members already talk about regional pay, so the possibility cannot be rule out.<br><br>
We may find more junior nursing grades are used in wards. Indeed, that is happening now, because it is an effective way to make economies within an enterprise that has to show a surplus or profit. Underqualified staff may be used on skilled functions. Then there are the ambulancemen, who may be balloted.</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This sounds like the brief from COHSE, the hon. Gentleman's sponsors. May I put a question to him? Are wages and salaries higher or lower in the independent sectors in education and health care than in the NHS and state system? I can tell the hon. Gentleman that wages and salaries are, in fact, higher in the independent sector. One has to pay more when there is a shortage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the best answer that I can give—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues, I express the hope that he will not be diverted down that road. I have already said that he is going wider than the amendments warrant, because he is now dealing with the general area of NHS trusts. I remind the hon. Gentleman again that there will be opportunities to discuss the general issues and principles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I must refer to the ballot of people who work within the NHS. Ambulancemen will be balloted under the amendment, and they will wish to take account of the attitude of opted-out trust boards of directors, that attitude can be summed up in a word—contractorisation, or privatisation. There is no doubt that ambulancemen will have a view to express if there is any likelihood of their local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
hospitals opting out.<br><br>
Let us consider ancillary workers who, again, would be balloted. They know that their pay will be cut when there is little local competition, and they know in advance that their conditions of employment will be substantially reduced, once Whitley is removed.<br><br>
Then there are the laboratory staff in hospitals who, again, would be balloted under our proposed arrangements. We know that opted-out hospital boards of directors will be in favour of contractorisation, because discussions on the subject are already taking place.<br><br>
Let us examine the attitude towards consultants. They, too, would be the subject of a ballot under the amendments. They are in a curious position. In my view, they may receive major increases in pay because they exercise pay clout in market conditions. It is exactly what happened in the United States of America.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman <span class='memberconstituency'> (Peckham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are all millionaires.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They manipulate the service and extract from it whatever they can and, as my Hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) says, many of them are millionaires. Once the pay review board recommendations are set aside, there is nothing to prevent market clout from operating in their favour.<br><br>
There may be pressure within the trust—I am sure that it would influence their decision in the ballot—to allow a certain flexibility in consultants' private work. The trust may wish to circumvent existing arrangements in the rules that the Minister is introducing for consultant contracts. I think that I understand the fundamentals of the Bill, but perhaps I am wrong. I am sure that my hon. Friends will correct if I am wrong, but once the trusts are set up, consultants' contracts may not be subject to those rules. I hope that the Minister will clarify the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have. given the hon. Gentleman several warnings. He is going way beyond what we should now be discussing, which is the nature of the ballots. I ask him either to draw his remarks to a conclusion or to stick closely to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of your considerable efforts, Dame Janet, to curtail my remarks—not for reasons that I do not understand; I understand that you feel that I am stepping out of order, and that you are not denying me the opportunity to speak again on these matters—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not seeking to curtail, but to channel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My view is that all these groups would have an interest in a ballot taking place, but in the light of what you said. Dame Janet, I shall resume my seat and seek to catch your eye, perhaps later this evening.</span></p>
