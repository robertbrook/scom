	<p>	<i>Question resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Something happened tonight that has not happened before—not enough members of the Committee were present to form a quorum. It took 45 seconds for enough members of the Committee to come into the Room to pay attention to the good, piercing arguments that the Opposition will advance. Before we adjourned, I was trying to make a speech, but to no avail. I was interrupted too many times. I hope that that will now improve. I must advise the Financial Secretary that our debate before dinner lasted two and a half hours, not three, although it might have felt like three hours to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) that we shall want to speak to other amendments, especially amendment No. 99.I have considered the matter and, although the debate will concentrate on the management of waste, we shall want to make different points from those that we made earlier. I should like to do as my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) suggested, and refer to the case of Knight v. Calder Grove Estates. I am fairly sure that I quoted an extract from the summing up of that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I followed my hon. Friend's introductory remarks with great attention, and I am fairly sure that he has not explained that aspect. It would be helpful if he could recapitulate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be careful about recapitulating as I should hate to have to ask him to sit down because of tedious repetition. Will he be a little careful from now on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope that I have not indulged in any repetition. I shall not mention the case of Knight v. Calder Grove Estates. The case on which I shall make my final comment concerns what is capital and what is revenue. I wish to quote from the judgments of Lords Justices Dillon, Russell and Mann on the case of Kauri Timber Company Limited v. Commissioner of Taxes 1913 AC771. I do not know the meaning of "AC"—unfortunately, the hon. Member for Beacons-field (Mr. Smith) is not here to tell me. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, Mr. Coleman, that you will be aware that it refers to the Court of Appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In their summing up, the Lords Justices stated:
	<br><q><p>"There land was acquired with timber on it for the purpose of selling and disposing of the timber. The cost of the acquisition of the land was a capital cost and the company was not entitled to make any reduction for tax purposes from the gross profits of its timber business in respect of the value of the standing timber which it had cut, thereby diminishing the value of its capital asset. Lord Shaw, in giving the opinion of the Judicial Committee, said: 'It appears to the Board that the present case involves no refinement of distinction; for the transaction under which these timber rights were acquired was not one under which a mere possession of goods by a contract of sale was given to the appellant company, but was one under which they obtained an interest in, and possession of, land.'"</p></q>
The question whether buying land is a capital transaction bedevils clause 69. Perhaps that land has a hole in it; it may have "airspace"—which we shall be talking about quite a lot in time to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Will my hon. Friend consider the impact of Regent Oil Co. Ltd. v. Strick (Inspector of Taxes)? I know that my hon. Friend will be aware of that case; it is to be found in the Appeal Court reports of 1966. The Committee should consider the remarks of Lord Reid, who specifically addressed the distinction between capital and revenue. He was quoted with approval in that case. I hope that that has not escaped my hon. Friend's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It has not. I have here the summing up in the Regent Oil case, which was decided, by Lord Wilberforce, among others. He said:
	<br><q><p>"mere repetition of capital expenditure cannot turn it into revenue expenditure".</p></q>
That needs to be discussed. I hope that amendment No. 173 does not run counter to what Lord Wilberforce said. The danger is that, unless we have strict rules on what is allowable as capital expenditure, we will give rise to a large tax avoidance industry. I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) agrees that that is in no one's interest. It cannot be in the Government's interest; nor is it in our interest as members of the Committee, because we would have to sit until 2 am trying to close avoidance loopholes. We should not create them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) is far more experienced than I am in legal matters. I know that he wants to speak; perhaps he could make part of his speech on the amendment. I know that my hon. Friend missed the first part of the debate, but that does not disqualify him. I would certainly like to hear his opinion; it would help firm up my mind to vote against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Kauri Timber Company case is most interesting. If one has timber standing on land then, as the Lords Justices said, the cost of acquisition of the land was a capital cost and the company was not entitled to make a deduction for tax purposes of its timber business in respect of the value of the timeber that it had cut. That is a cursory reading. I am not an expert, but I find such a strict judgment surprising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am following closely what my hon. Friend is saying, which brings us back to what I suspect we shall regard as the amendent No. 99 problem. It could be argued that the timber stored on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
site was stored not for eventual disposal, but for storage. If the courts continue to decide in the way that they have, the Committee will get into considerable difficulties when debating the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats relating specifically to storage and not to disposal, which is the subject currently under discussion. The tax case cited by my hon. Friend dealt specifically with storage and was held to have influenced the events under discussion now. That will make it difficult to deal with the clause on storage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is quite right. More problems are raised than are solved. The more I think about it, the more problems come to mind. Simple cases for which there is case law, such as standing timber on land, can cause problems. There is some case law on waste management and on concessions for restoration payments. Clearly, there have been tax concessions on, for example, preparing sites and finding licences. That is more complicated than the simple case of having timber on land, some of which is cut. We must be satisfied that insuperable problems and a large tax avoidance industry will not arise under the new tax regime for waste management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Esher can assure us that he has considered all the issues that have arisen and that the amendment will not open up any large tax loopholes, I should not object to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must be aware of two insuperable problems in what he has just said. First, as was said in the previous debate, tax avoidance is one of the most sophisticated industries operating in this country. Conservative Members could probably tell us about that more convincingly than even I could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the industry under discussion is not small. The turnover of the waste disposal industry—both public and private sectors—is several billion pounds a year and it is set to grow. In those circumstances, The Committee must be cautious when dealing with tax treatment, especially if there is a possibility of openin up tax loopholes. While I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham says, when considering the amendment of the hon. Member for Esher, he must bear in mind the scale of those twin problems: the artfulness of the avoidance industry and the size of the waste disposal industry's turnover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is being helpful and the Committee must consider that point. I have a figure for the turnover somewhere in my notes and I believe that it is some £500 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It may be relevant that the turnover of the Wimpey subsidiaries whose central activity was waste management more than doubled between 1984 and 1988 from £114 million to £233 million a year. That leads me to believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) is correct to draw the matter ot the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and that we are dealing with a sizeable industrial and commercial activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Yes, I think I am mistaken. I have jsut had a quick chat with my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). I was listening with one ear to him and with the other to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins). I think the figure that I gave for the waste management industry referred only to the private sector and when the public sector and the nuclear industry are added, the figure certainly comes to over £1 billion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The figures that I was offering my hon. Friend were specific to Wimpey, the company whose legal action triggered off the matter that we are discussing. Its turnover in waste management and related activities doubled between 1984 and 1988 from £114 million to £233 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Malek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Yes. When I said that the figure was some £500 million, I was probably thinking only of Wimpey and no one else. It is correct to say that the industry is very large and that is why we must consider the amendment carefully. If £10 or £20 was hanging on it, it would not matter so much, but the figures involved are large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no further comments to make for the time being. I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South has to say, and I hope that the hon. Member for Esher will give us some details so that we can assess the effect of the amendment a little more accurately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is a criterion, when judging the effectiveness of a Back Bench Member of Parliament, producing a debate of three hours on the back of two probing amendments is a signal success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A tribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) says it is a tribute, but I would be too embarrassed to repeat that more than once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman should not be embarrassed to accept the tributes that are due to him from both sides of the Committee. We enjoy his knowledgeable contributions to the Finance Bill Committee and the part that he plays in helping our legislation move steadily towards the statute book. He should not be shy of accepting tributes from his hon. Friends. They are shared by, dare I say it, friends that he has made on the Opposition Benches. He is making a valuable contribution to the Committee and I know that his ministerial colleagues are grateful to him for the contribution that he has made to our progress so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does me a great favour. It is probably also the kiss of death. However, I am very grateful to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a wide-ranging debate and I have been most impressed by the knowledge, wisdom and succinctness of Opposition Members. If nothing else, we have gone into a considerable analysis of an interesting court case—the case of Rolfe v. Wimpey Waste Management Ltd. The purpose of my two amendments was to ensure that the relief that the industry had always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
assumed and benefitted from would be given for all restoration expenditure whether incurred before or after 6 April 1989, that being the date of that decision. The purpose in tabling the amendments was not to seek new reliefs because, prior to the decision, the Revenue had not had disagreements with companies—certainly not on the principles—nor was it to seek a new principle of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in all our interests to ensure that waste management sites are properly restored, and I know that Opposition Members will agree. We are discussing the treatment of the operational costs of dealing with landfill sites and not capital items, so there is no distinction between that and what used to be the case prior to 6 April. My amendments were designed to regulate the treatment both before and afterwards, but my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made extremely telling points about the principles of taxation. Having listened carefully to all the arguments, I fear that my amendments are defective [Hon. Members: "No, no."] My judgment is that they are defective. Given that there was no attempt to create any relationship with tax avoidance but only a wish for specific considertion of the case in hand in relation to the Rolfe v. Wimpey judgment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Does the hon. Member have the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considerably put out by the approach of the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) to his amendments. He shows an uncharacteristic timidity in seeking leave to withdraw them when they have not been fully explored. They have the capacity to engage the Commttee for an almost indefinite period and we would do them a great disservice if we did not explore them just a little more before deciding whether it would be right for the hon. Gentleman to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am drawn down this path by the approach adopted by my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), although I wish that I could follow the lead given by those who are older and much more learned and experienced in law than me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Correct on all three counts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Yes, but the Committee knows how modest I am in approaching those matters and I do not believe that it should be made the subject of fun and derision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that I could adopt the line taken by those older and more experienced people, having heard the lengthy and comprehensive judgment of Lord Justice Dillon. It was as lucid, helpful and illuminating as the speech made for about two and three quarter hours by my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham. So bowled over were those people by the logic and persuasiveness of Lord Justice Dillon's argument that they could only gasp at the end of the proceedings, as Lord Justice Russell did, and say:
	<br><q><p>"I agree and there is nothing that I can usefully add."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I expected that response. Lord Justice Mann also gasped at the end of that lucid and helpful exploration of the issues and said:
	<br><q><p>"I agree and there is nothing I can usefully add."</p></q>
I wish that I could take the same course. I agree with my hon. Friedn the Member for Wrexham, but I feel that there is much that I can usefully add. Other Opposition Members feel the same and are gearing up to make their own speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall limit my remarks to a narrow compass, beyond which I shall not be tempted. We have heard what the hon. Member for Esher has said about running and operational costs. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) noted, the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of such matters is extensive. I add my plaudits to those that have already been expressed about the hon Gentleman, who knows that the distinction at the heart of the amendment, that between revenue and capital, is real. He will know too that the gravamen of the Wimpey case was to examine the attitude of the special commissioner to the subject matter of the amendments. That special commissioner took advice from four accountants, which ought to warm the hearts of Conservative Members, who always want accountants' advice to be taken. One of the accountants to whom the special commissioner chose to turn was a Mr. Weschler, who is not widely known—at least, he is not known to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have to say that Mr. Weschler, whose name is quite difficult to pronounce, is not known to me either. But I think that my hon. Friend has the same copy of the report of the case as I have, and if he examines it he will find that the other three accountants are described. No such description is given of Mr. Weschler, but that should not lead us to conclude that he is less significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. If the Committee is to debate everyone who is unknown to us, we shall be here for a millenium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That may be so. I should prefer also to see the faces of those who are speaking. After all, they are addressing their remarks to me and to nobody else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am very sorry, Mr. Coleman. I intended no discourtesy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman was showing his best side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the public school upbringing of some Conservative Members is beginning to shown through at this late and jaded hour. I intended no discourtesy to the Chair, but I am sure that you, Mr. Coleman, will appreciate how difficult it is, given the disposition of the Benches, to offer what I hoped was a helpful intervention to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South, while at the same time addressing the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry that the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) should be displaying such an attitude at this early hour. He has yet to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
show the Committee his best side, having been firmly rooted on his seat. I do not want to engage in speculation about the origins of Mr. Weschler, save to say that I do not doubt that his professional qualifications are at least as distinguished as those of his colleagues who also advised the special commissioner. They include a Mr. Scrutton of Coopers and Lybrand. I see a number of Conservative Members shoot up their heads at that name, because they know a good thing when they hear it. There was also a Mr. Miller, an Inland Revenue accountant, brought out and dusted down for the occassion, and a Mr. Chetwynd of Binder Hamlyn.

Those four gentlemen were of assistance to the special commission and may be of assistance to us when we come to consider this matter. It was their evidence
that led the special commissioner—we should examine her words in detail—to say:
	<br><q><p>"Not only [the taxpayer] but also others carrying on the business of waste management were concerned less with the land as such than with its capacity to accommodate waste; with the space—which was limited by the terms of the relevant planning permission and waste disposal licence—availale to be filled. I find that in acquiring the sites in question [the taxpayer] saw itself as acquiring airspace."</p></q>
That is precisely the point made by the hon. Member for Esher in relation to operational costs. It is precisely the point that the amendment would take on board in seeking to enable the operator—here referred to as the taxpayer—to claim. But we are determined that the amendments will be withdrawn.

Lord Justice Reid dealt with the case of Regent Oil Co. Ltd. v. Strick (Inspector of Taxes) 1966.I referred to page 295 of the report earlier. If my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham would prefer—he probably would, on account of his tastes in this matter—I can refer him to 3 All England reports 1965. Taste will depend on the individual's tradition.

Lord Reid addresses us in his characteristically trenchant way about the general approach that the courts should adopt in these cases. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Esher would have preferred it if the court had not adopted the approach that it did; yet the court did adopt that view, prompted by Lord Reid, and we are required to consider these matters at length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend should not be shy about the length of time that we are taking to debate these matters.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
accountants, professional presentation from barristers and its own reserves of expertise in legal matters; yet we are only humble, lay, political representatives of our communities and we are trying to reach very difficult decisions on the same complex matter at the invitation of the Government, who are attempting to set aside the court's judgment. That is why we should not be shy of debating the measure in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Indeed, it may be worth reflecting on who argued the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I say that because, too often, it is relevant, when considering the consequences of Court of Appeal judgments, to know how judges' minds have been influenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can help, because I am getting lost. How do these judgments relate to amendment No. 173? I would be obliged if the hon. Gentleman would narrow his remarks and deal with that amendment. We have gone a long way on that judgment. It is time to be more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I agree, Mr. Coleman. The amendment seeks to apply relief to before 6 April 1989. It would restore a situation that their Lordships found was unjustifiable in law or by weight of evidence. They decided that the argument that they had heard could not be justified by examination and analysis of all that had gone before. In considering whether we should go down the road along which the hon. Member for Esher invites us, it is important that we understand why their Lordship felt that we should not go down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman said that I was inviting the Opposition to go down that road.

I understand why the hon. Member for Esher should seek to close that gate three hours after opening it. But having given us a glimpse of what lies down that primrose path, he cannot expect us to step back from the temptation of going down it. Because we have been invited to go down that path, we must examine why it was found to be faulty. That is why I return to the line of reasoning adopted by Lord Reid—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:There is no further point of order. It has been made.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. The hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) suggested that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It would be helpful to explore Lord Reid's reasoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am benefiting from my hon. Friend's legal skill and much becomes clearer. The independent view of the judiciary is a hidden issue. My hon. Friend will correct me if I am wrong, but the Court of Appeal overturned the decisions of the commissioners. My hon. Friend pointed out that one of the commissioners' advisers was from Coopers and Lybrand. When my hon. Friend makes a case for the independence of the judiciary, he should bear in mind that Coopers and Lybrand professionally advises many waste disposal companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always a mesh of interests in these matters and this case is no exception. The mesh even extends into the Committee and familiar strands can be found in it, for example, Coopers and Lybrand. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East is welcome to follow that strand wherever it leads. He was right when he said that the clause that the hon. Member for Esher seeks to amend was a case of the special commissioners biting back. They wanted to get round the judges. They failed, after taking the advice of four distinguished accountants, including a representative of Coopers and Lybrand. They now seek to achieve that through the Bill and the deliberations of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should return, without further interruption, to the reasoning of Lord Reid in the case of Regent Oil v. Strick, and link it with amendment No. 173, which seeks to omit the words
	<br><q><p>"on or after 6th April 1989".</p></q>
What would that achieve? It would mean a return to a position that their Lordships considered unjustified in law and indefensible on the basis of the arguments and evidence before the court. Lord Reid said:
	<br><q><p>"Whether a particular outlay by a trader can be set against income or must be regarded as a capital outlay has proved to be a difficult question".</p></q>
Would anyone here demur from that conclusion? It is a difficult question. Lord Reid continued:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
	<br><q><p>"It may be possible to reoncile all the decisions but it is certainly not possible to reconcile all the reasons given for them."</p></q>
9.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has a familiar ring to all members of the Committee. We can all think of decisions that it would be possible to reconcile and can reflect on the reasons given for those decisions that are impossible to reconcile. I do not wish to give examples of recent political decisions and considerations, of possible reasons why a particular decision was taken, or of the difficulties in reconciling those reasons. The point was made well by Lord Reid. He said:
	<br><q><p>"I think that much of the difficulty has arisen from taking too literally general statements made in earlier cases and seeking to apply them to a different kind of case which their authors almost certainly did not have in mind—in seeking to treat expressions of judicial opinion as if they were words in an Act of Parliament."</p></q>
It is those last few words that the hon. Member for Esher tried to include in an Act of Parliament but that we must call into doubt when we hold them against the criteria that is contained within the expression of judicial appeal. Lord Reid referred to another difficulty. He said:
	<br><q><p>"as further source of difficulty has been a tendency in some cases to treat some one criterion as paramount and to press it to its logical conclusion without proper regard to other factors in the case."</p></q>
We are warned specifically against that course of action. Sadly, the hon. Member for Esher perhaps fell into that trap. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham pointed that out several times, so there is no need for me to replicate his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is by no means a replication of the argument, but a clarification and something that could be prayed in aid, to refer to the judgment of Lord Macmillan in the well-known case of Van den Berghs Ltd. v. Clark. I see an instant look of recognition flashing across the face of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, who will recall Lord Macmillan's words.
	<br><q><p>"While each case is found to turn upon its own facts, and no infallible criterion emerges, nevertheless the decisions are useful as illustrations and as affording indications of the kind of considerations which may relevantly be borne in mind in approaching the problem."</p></q>
I am almost tempted to say that nothing further needs to be added, but I shall resist that temptation and consider Lord Reid's reasoning when he says:
	<br><q><p>"The Income Tax Act requires the balance of profits and gains to be found. So a profit and loss account must be prepared setting on one side income receipts and on the other expenses properly chargeable against them."</p></q>
The difficulty with the amendment is that it would allow us to condone a certain situation. Before 6 April 1989, it will be possible to set certain forms of expenses against liability in tax. We believe that that requires the most careful scrutiny before we are prepared to accompany the hon. Member for Esher down that path or even to approach it, with him holding our hands—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points at the heart of amendment No. 173, which seeks to omit
	<br><q><p>"on or after 6th April 1989"</p></q>
and thus to alter the tax treatment afforded by clause 69. First, substantial sums of money are now involved
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
in the waste disposal industry. Secondly, there is the extraordinary ingenuity of the modern tax avoidance industry. To accept amendment No. 173 could provide considerable scope for abuse. We cannot tell how much scope, as the Financial Secretary, the only person who could have collected the statistics, has told us somewhat unhelpfully that he has not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:You may agree, Mr. Coleman, that there is a price to be paid for the failure to collect statistics. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East has rightly drawn our attention to the scope for abuse here, but right across the economic front we are paying the price for failing to collect statistics on issues about which we have consistently been warning the Government for many years. My hon. Friend, and my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham, Dr. Marek have been in the forefront with these warnings, but scant regard was paid to them by the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) when he presided over these matters, which was before 6 April 1989. Scant regard is paid to them now, under a different Chancellor of the Exchequer. We are faced with the potential for abuse that my hon Friend pointed out to the Committee. We must be constantly alert to that potential; it requires infinite vigilance. It was to that potential and the need that that which was due should be paid that Lord Reid himself when he said:
	<br><q><p>"In so far as the Act prohibits a particular kind of deduction it must receive effect. But beyond that no one has to my knowledge questioned the opinion of Lord President Clyde in 	<i>Whimster & Co. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue,</i> where, after stating that profit is the diffence betwen receipts and expenditure"</p></q>
he went on to talk of profit and loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a little lecture, which you may have missed, Mr. Coleman, at our last sitting when we were debating overseas banking and debt. We were given a long homily on the meaning of the word "profit", and as a result we find ourselves in the position we are today. Would that the hon. Member concerned had spent less time delivering homilies and given a little more attention to the deliberations of the Committee. Perhaps that would have been asking too much of a poor man's master of the universe, who appears to be impervious to the discomfiture of both Opposition Members and his hon. Friends when he goes on at length in the way that he does. He would have been assisted this evening had he but considered the words of Lord President Clyde who gave the simplest definition of profit as
	<br><q><p>"the difference between receipts and expenditure".</p></q>
If only others would adopt that example of avoiding prolixity, lengthy speeches and going on and on and on and on and on and on and on when it is possible to say it all in six words. We urge Members of the Committee to think of that definition of profit when considering the amendment. Lord President Clyde also said:
	<br><q><p>"the account of profit and loss to be made up for the purpose of ascertaining that difference must be framed consistently with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting so far as applicable."</p></q>
Lord Reid continues:
	<br><q><p>"So it is not surprising that no one test of principle or rule of thumb is paramount. The question is ultimately a question of law for the court, but it is a question which must be answered in the light of all the circumstances which it is reasonable to take into account".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
The amendment would overturn that reasoning in such a way as to enable the item to be set against tax liability for a period before 6 April 1989. In considering the amendment, we must do as we have been advised by Lord Justice Reid and take into account all the relevant circumstances. In that way, the circumstances outlined in the Environment Select Committee report on toxic waste will have a direct bearing on whether it is desirable or in the public interest that we should go back in time before 6 April 1989 to allow the reliefs that are claimed. Is it desirable that those responsible for some of the appallingly managed landfill sites that the Environment Select Committee found it necessary to highlight in its report—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can help me. How is the Environment Select Committee report relevant to the judgment which I accept is relevant to the amendment? The hon. Gentleman seems to be going rather wide of the judgment to which he has been referring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I would not want to go wide of the amendment. I take into account your strictures, Mr. Coleman, on the dangers of going so wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being invited to implement what amounts to retrospective legislation. To that conclusion one is driven. One does not embark upon the path of retrospective legislation unless one is satisfied that the mischief that it would achieve is such as to warrant its implementation. Therefore, in considering whether the amendments are warranted, we should consider the operations of waste disposal companies prior to 6 April 1989. If those operations do not warrant retrospective legislation, it would be wrong to enact it. Therefore, one has to consider the level of expenditure and where it has been directed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hesitate to remind my hon. Friend of this matter, because it will no doubt be at the front of his mind as he served on the Select Committee, but the evidence of Mr. Hewitt of the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors may be relevant. He said:
	<br><q><p>"I would say that we very definitely believe that the industry has improved enormously in those eight years."</p></q>
Mr. Hewitt was referring to the years between 1980 and 1988. The amendment would affect the expenditure that was incurred at a time when Mr. Hewitt said that the industry's performance could have been greatly improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Mr. Hewitt's evidence is etched on my memory, because he gave it when the Committee was exercised by the deficiencies that we found in our exploration of waste disposal sites. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Esher has not said what impact he envisages the amendment having on the ability of the industry to respond to the challenges outlined by the Select Committee report. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central said, members of the industry shared those challenges with the Committee when they gave evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is on to an interesting point. I also wish to draw his attention to the evidence

given by Dr. Willetts on behalf of the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors. He alluded to the fact that numerous reputable companies formed part of that association, but that there were several other companies about which he had considerable reservations. The hon. Member for Esher makes no distinction between the two categories of companies and there is no test of performance, which strikes me as relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is highly relevant. I know that the hon. Member for Esher would have no truck with the cowboys in the industry who, mercifully, are finding it increasingly difficult to operate under a tightening regime. Unfortunately, it is not yet tight enough. It is a matter of concern that they may be able to avail themselves of the benefit of the amendment prior to 6 April 1989 when their excesses were at their height and did not attract the degree of public scrutiny that they now do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The words of Dr. Willetts are relevant to this point. He said:
	<br><q><p>"Anyone with a redundancy cheque can buy a mini-skip and can set themselves up as a waste disposal contractor."</p></q>
Those worries were expressed pithily to the Committee. No doubt my hon. Friend had them in mind when voicing his objection to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do have them in mind. It would not take too much imagination to foresee circumstances in which part of that redundancy cheque would go towards hiring an accountant. However, that accountant would not come from Coopers and Lybrand as he would probably take up the entire redundancy cheque. The sort of accountant to whom I am referring would all too readily give the kind of advice which my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), outlined. Rogue contractors—the cowboys—would take advantage of the dangerous advice that could be given under the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should not like my hon. Friend to forget the cowgirls; they are also important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Will the hon. Member repeat his remark? I did not hear it as he was looking down at the desk. As I have said previously, I want to hear the comments of hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My intervention referred to the inclusion of cowgirls as well as cowboys in my hon. Friend's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I did not mean to use language that was gender exclusive. I would hesitate before attracting the approbation that such a statement would rightly attract from certain quarters.

said that those responsible for the waste disposal industry, especially the dirty end of that industry and its moral practices are, in the main, men. I cannot recall an instance when the Select Committee on the Environment discussed a company under the control of a woman that was exhibiting standards that were wanting. Therefore, perhaps the term "cowboy or rogue companies" is entirely correct. While we should not be gender exclusive, we should be gender specific. When a specific problem can be attributed to a macho and irresponsible approach to waste disposal, it should be revealed as such. Our worry is that the amendment makes no attempt to distinguish—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) who, as a close friend of the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors, may have access to that figure? It is the sort of reasoning behind the 13 amendments tabled in the names of the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans), and it is reasonable to believe that the hon. Gentleman would have access to that figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I suspect that all we would get from the hon. Member for Esher is the simple phrase tht says it all—"Loadsamoney''—[Interruption.] Loadsamo-ney—not for us but from us; from the taxpayer, certainly, in the direction of the industry that the hon. Gentleman represents. That may be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want anyone to go from this Committee tonight concluding that we are agin the waste disposal industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. The waste disposal industry has no greater friend than the Opposition—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> On reflection, perhaps it has at least one greater friend. The waste disposal industry has a firm friend in the Opposition when it addresses itself to the issues in hand and when it conducts itself in an environmentally conscious and safe manner and does so for a reasonable return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:How can the hon. Gentleman possibly be a friend to the environment and to the waste disposal industry when, even as he speaks, he is responsible for chopping down more and more trees to make paper for Hansard to record the words that are falling on such stoney ground?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:If the hon. Gentleman were really concerned about trees he would have spared us the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
pulp of the remarks that he found it necessary to make. I do not say that uncharitably because, no doubt, he felt compelled to make an intervention. On reflection, was it worth the twig? [Interruption.] Root and branch, someone said but, being a concerned environmentalist, the hon. Gentleman may feel that that is a twig too far and be persuaded not to make further interventions of that nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I suggest that we get back to the waste disposal industry and forget all about forestry for the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure that you are right, Mr. Coleman. Let us return to the waste disposal industry and its friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If only the hon. Member for Esher would now respond to my hon. Friends with a cry which is parroted by all of us—how much will it cost? If we were satisfied about that, we could move on, but we are not, so we must pursue if further. We do so in the context not only of the environmental implications of the measure but of its implications for the tax regime as a whole, because the logic adopted by the noble and learned lords in the case of Rolfe v. Wimpey Waste is not to be cast aside without the clearest explanation of the reasons why it should. We have not heard those reasons in the course of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of that case, an attempt was made by counsel for the respondent, Wimpey waste, to distinguish between the previous run of cases and the principles enunciated therein and the logic applied by the special commissioners. He said that the cost of acquisition of landfill sites was to be calculated using a specific formula. In the course of the debate tonight and, who knows, to morrow morning, we shall have cause to reflect on the impact of specific formulae. It would not act as a loss leader or an advertisement for the debate that is to come to outline that we have specific worries about the forumlae to be used in calculating those matters. My hon. Friend for Newcastle upon Tyne, East will address the Committee on that issue in the fullness of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion, our worry relates specifically to the advisability of going back beyond the date of 6 April 1989 stated in the amendment for the purposes of the calculation of the tax due applying that formula. Is it right that we should go back beyond that date and has a case to that end been made? [Hon. Members: "No."] The cry comes back, no, no. Why? Because the date of 6 April 1989 presents us with a dilemma. If it is right to seek to undo what the case in question achieved in stating a legal position different from that upon which the industry's affairs were based previously, can it be right to undo that achievement for the years before that date? We say that it cannot be right to do so unless the Committee is satsified that all the circumstances warrant it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am following my hon Friend's argument closely and am growing more uneasy almost by the second. The implication is that the amendment would put matters back to where they were. Yet my hon. Friend appears to suggest that categories of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
expenditure that would not have attracted tax relief before the decision under discussion would, as a result of the amendment of the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor), begin to attract it because of other changes being made in the clause. If that is so, the problem is very serious and my hon. Friend is right to alert the Committee to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not sure whether it would or would not. That uncertainty gives rise to doubt about the amendment's wisdom. What is certain is that the industry's appetite is such that it would seek to call upon a tax regime that went beyond what existed before the impact of the judgment. Like Oliver, the industry wants more. Should it be given more? If so, should that gift be backdated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The indsutry's representations have a dual prupose, as was made clear in a memorandum contained in the appendices to the third volume of the first report on contaminated land from the Select Committee on the Environment. As I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central takes a keen interest in such matters, I can tell him that the reference is Session 1989-90,170-III. The report states:
	<br><q><p>"The industry is making representations to the Government that the taxation laws should be amended in order to provide a) for relief in respect of expenditure on the acqusition of airspace on a basis similar to that which exists in relation to the acquisition of mineral rights."</p></q>
That is the first request. The second is for
	<br><q><p>"relief by way of deduction from profits or by way of capital allowances, as appropriate, for all expenditure incurred in the preparation, operation, restoration and after care of landfill sites."</p></q>
The second request is clear and understandable enough. The first appears to go beyond the existing law. That shows the industry's appetite for concessions. Where there is appetite, there is the possibility of abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I understand clearly my hon. Friend's point. He has described himself already as a friend of the waste disposal industry. Let me draw to his attention that, between 1984 and 1988, the after-tax profits of George Wimpey plc, of which Wimpey Waste Management—the company involved in the court case that we are rightly spending so much time on—is a part, rose from £34 million to £92 million. Whatever one's wider views—and I do not want to get distracted by that—I recognise that it is perfectly proper for profits to rise in a healthy capitalist system. The company may want more, but its annual report suggests that it is already doing not too badly, even without the benefit of the amendment of the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It would be wrong to highlight the experience of a specific company. My hon. Friend says with good cause that that is indicative of an increase in the profits of the industry in general. That is a justified comment which is more than borne out by the example of George Wimpey plc and it requires our mature and considered reflection when we come to ponder the wisdom of a couple of amendments that would undoubtedly add to those profits. It should be made clear that one is a friend of the waste disposal industry
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
in the sense that one is a friend of the environment. It is not possible to envisage protecting the environment without a waste disposal industry. Somebody has to do it. The job must be done well, efficiently and safely and the waste must not just be dumped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is perfectly correct on the ground on which he made his point. However, I must draw to his attention that the municipal waste disposal industry does not benefit from the matters under discussion. The clause and the judgment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. As they do not benefit from the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not comment further, otherwise he will be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:One must bear in mind the impact of a healthy industry on municipal collection. When the industry in general is healthy, municipal activity is undergirded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The municipal waste disposal industry is not confined to collection. It includes also some important disposal facilities that have none of those benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I will not pursue that, Mr. Coleman, despite attempts to make me. In relation to collection and disposal, one cannot divorce the existence of a municipal industry from that of the private sector. In many instances, the two can complement each other, but both must be healthy. The amendment deals with the health of the private sector, on which I want to reflect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be in the interests of the environment for the private sector to be healthy and not to carry out the illicit dumping of materials and the scattering of waste such as asbestos bags.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:As you will recall, Mr. Coleman, prior to adjourning for the Division, we were discussing the impact of the amendment on the failure of the clause to cover, in a way in which the hon. Member for Esher would wish, the issue of tax relief during the period immediately before the relevant date—6 October 1989. The question that has exercised our minds for several hours and is like to do so for many more hours is "Cui bono?"— "Who benefits?" What public interest would be satisfied if we allowed those who managed landfill sites to go back beyond 6 April 1989 and to offset them against tax expenditure covered by the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend has referred to management of landfill sites. I draw his attention to the rest of the clause, especially subsection (5), which defines
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
the activities to be covered by the clause, and therefore by the amendment, as
	<br><q><p>"collection, treatment, conversion and final depositing of waste materials, or any of those activies."</p></q>
That covers not only the management of landfill sites, but, if the word "conversion" has its common sense meaning, incineration prior to disposal in landfill sites. The matter is very wide and does not cover only the management of landfill sites.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am glad that my hon. Friend chose to highlight the breadth of the clause. The public has in the forefront of its mind the management of landfill sites because of the scars that they cause. There are perhaps few more unsightly sights than poorly managed landfill sites. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) recall trampling through the mud, hour in and hour out, during our field trips in the course of our duties on the Select Committee on the Environment. I know that the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) has memories of that. Not even his beloved Bop has anything to compare with the sight of waste and desolation—there is plenty of that in Bophuthatswana—that we sometimes faced during the Committee's travail. We did not allow our minds to wander,—it would be wrong to allow that while considering the amendments—from the fact that landfill sites are but one part of a mosaic of waste disposal activities. I use the word "mosaic" advisedly, knowing that my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) has an interest in the matter. His interest in waste disposal is legendary in his municipality. I hope that he will speak, if not tonight, then tomorrow morning. He should assist the Committee with his recollections of the mosaic of waste disposal in Carlisle. Sometimes, in listening to my hon. Friend, one might think that it was impossible to go beyond Carlisle and that there was no civilised life outside it, but that is not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I never suggested it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend says that he never suggested it, but I think that he has on other Committees. It is possible to see, even outside Carlisle, examples of practices and procedures in the waste disposal industry that cause anxieties with which the amendments fail to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example is the treatment of waste. My hon. Friends know of developments in the treatment of waste. Chemical treatment of waste causes much anxiety. It is mainly used for inorganic waste and covers a range of techniques from dewatering to complex chemical processing to render chemicals safe. The hon. Member for Basingstoke may recall a visit to the Netherlands. I cannot remember whether he was with us—he may have been travelling elsewhere, perhaps in Bophuthatswana. We visited the Netherlands—a democracy which enjoys a liberty and prosperity not yet found in Bophuthatswana. We found several examples of the dewaterning process. Those hon. Members who are not au fait with the process—I fear that there may be one or two to my rear and more to my front—should realise that the process is essentially one of drying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That is precisely the point that I was trying to make, but my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Chris) said it more succinctly. We are discussing a group of amendments along with Government amendment No. 165. Amendment No. 174 was tabled by the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans), who is taking part in the Adjournment debate at present. Government amendment No. 167 is a consequential amendment and next on the selection list is our amendment No. 199, and amendment No. 176, which was tabled by Conservative Members. I hope that we shall be hearing from them, although they need not say as much as the Financial Secretary, who must tell us what the Government intend by their amendments Nos. 165 and 167 and say what he thinks about amendments Nos. 174,119,199 and 176.

Amendment No. 199 is a simple amendment which would leave out the words:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure that it was a slip of the tongue, but my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It was indeed a slip of the tongue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem, as many licences run out before restoration work can be completed. Licences may give a right to a waste management company to carry out tipping activities. Such licences may run for four, five for six years and may be subject to all sorts of conditions, but they could run out before restoration work takes place. I do not know much about waste management, but some of may hon Friend's are experts. I wonder whether a tip needs time to compact, or whether that would happen quickly. Before the yard of clay or foot of topsoil was added, a tip would be exposed to winter frost, rain and wind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:In the context of the tax position of tips, I wonder whether it is recognised that many tips produce methane gas and are being sold as a valuable asset—they are now seen as environmentally friendly, even though they actually are not. Does this clause, or

any other clause in the Bill, take into account that often we are creating a valuable asset by allowing people to tip? The waste disposal companies could be compared to the oil companies, so perhaps we should tax them as we do the oil companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That is a good suggestion. I hope that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend suggests that the hon. Member for Esher wants a deletion. Government amendment No. 165, to which some Front Bench Opposition Members have added their names, is similar to amendment No. 174. The Bill says
	<br><q><p>"This section applies where …</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) at the time the payment is made the person holds a relevant licence which is then in force."</p></q>
But a relevant licence may have expired by the time a payment is made for restoration costs.

I was developing this theme, but I wish to be guided by my hon. Friends, who are experts in these matters. A tip might have to be allowed to stay open for perhaps a year or two so that it could compact properly. It might be inappropriate to impose a ceiling of clay or any subsoil on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is why we added our names to that of the Chief Secretary on amendment No. 165. We should, however, like to be assured that there is a good reason for the amendment to be made. Can the Financial Secretary say that, in his experience, there is a real need for the amendment? If he could, we would be reassured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we all deplore the failure of the Financial Secretary to offer even a modicum of explanation of Government amendments, led by one in the name of his right hon.

he has had so far. I draw my hon. Friend's attention to amendment No. 176, which was tabled by the hon. Members for Esher (Mr. Taylor) and for Wyre (Mr. Mans), and is grouped with amendment No. 174. Amendment No. 199, tabled by the Opposition, would amend the clause by inserting the phrase, "any relevant licence", whereas the hon. Member for Esher seeks only to insert the words, "relevant licence". That is more limited. The Opposition amendment would clarify the matter as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:We need a definition of "relevant licence".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Earlier, when discussing the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Esher, I mentioned the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors. Has that organisation circulated hon. Members about licensing? We were not lobbied about the previous set of amendments. I have a copy of the Environment Select Committee's second report on toxic waste, in which the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors gives detailed evidence about the problem. Although the hon. Member for Esher has tabled many amendments and declared an interest as director of a waste disposal company, he has not consulted the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. The previous debate was very wide ranging. We must now confine ourselves to the amendments. Long interventions do not help progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Thank you, Mr. Coleman. I hope that you agree that I have stuck closely to the amendments. I shall continue to do so as we debate the second group, which contains six amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Licences can run out before restoration is complete. There are two ways of looking at the problem. The authorities could say that a licence was in force when the deposition of waste was undertaken. If that can be shown to have been the case and that the deposition had stopped by the time the licence ran out, it could be a simple matter for the tax to be claimed for the restoration as suggested in clause 69. On the other hand, I suspect that it may be the case at present—a little advice on the matter from the Financial Secretary would not go amiss—that if a licence expires before all the work is completed, a new licence would have to be applied for under the Control of Pollution Act 1974 or other legislation. I do not know the answer, but some of my hon. Friends know more about those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a new licence had to be applied for, that procedure would cost money. It would also be a waste of time for Government Departments as well as the waste disposal contractor, because, under the Control of Pollution Act 1974, the new licence would have to come from whatever Department issued the first licence. I hope that all members of the Committee agree that we should not put those Departments under a greater strain than is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

for a new licence is granted. Will my hon. Friend ask the Financial Secretary who will be held responsible for any accident or environmental disaster, however small, that may occur when there is no licence for the site?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend asks an interesting question. If there is no licence and an unforeseen accident or emergency requires expenditure in the period before an application for a licence is granted, can that cost be written off against corporation tax? I do not know the answer, but if the Financial Secretary had used his other brief—the longer one, not the summary supplied to him—we might have been given one. My hon. Friend has raised an interesting point about expenditure incurred when an operator does not hold a valid licence for a site. I can imagine that resulting in a legal case on a par with the one that we dicussed which involved Lord Justice Dillon et al where the matter would have to be decided. The time of tax commissioners might be taken up in deciding whether the expenditure was allowable.

When examining amendments, it is our job to ensure that they are clear, concise and will not create work for accountants and judges. We have too many accountants, lawyers and judges in this country and we could do with as few of them as possible. The hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) raises his eyebrows but my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) took my remark in his stride and did not even hear it. I mean no disrespect to those professions but we must make it a matter of principle to keep their numbers within bounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hesitate to interrupt my hon. Friend, but surely I could not have heard him aright when he talked about 2 million lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and note his reluctance to do so. As a Back Bench Member, I am trying to follow the argument between the Government and Opposition Front Benches. When my hon. Friend added his name to Government amendment No. 165, did he think then that amendment would restore a right to tax relief which had been affected by the judgment involving Wimpey Waste Management, or did he think that it would create an additional right to tax relief that did not exist prior to the judgment? There is a difference, and I am worried about this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is right to be worried. I admit that I did not think hard about it at the time. My

name may have been slipped on to the list before I knew about it. My memory is imperfect—that is probably the best way of putting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My interpretation of amendment No. 165 in the name of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is that it would simplify public administration. That is where the number of lawyers and accountants who would be involved comes into the matter, albeit tangentially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment can simplify public administration, ensuring more certainty for companies and less tax avoidance, it should, as a general principle, be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am following my hon. Friend's argument closely, and I am not totally satisfied with it. We are all in favour of simplification, and I sympathise with his view about there being too many lawyers and accountants. However, I am a socialist of the old school, and should like to know whether such simplification will lead to too many tax inspectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That is an interesting point, but I shall not stray from the matter before us. Tax inspectors are important because, under some amendments in the group, they would have to vet claims by waste disposal companies and ensure that relevant licences were held. Under Government amendment No. 165, however, tax inspectors would not have to check whether companies had licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central point it that public administrators—tax inspectors—will have to look at the claims to see whether they satisfy the provisions of clause 69.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred earlier to the importance of avoiding doubt about the clause's meaning. Does he agree that as waste disposal is a new and burgeoning industry, expanding almost exponentially, it is important when laying down the framework for the future, that we do not leave our heirs with a framework that contains a scintilla of doubt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend is right. I hope that the waste disposal industry does not expand exponentially or the Amazon jungle would disappear quickly. There are arguments for containing the industry's growth. We want clarity and simplicity. If we can save money on public administration, we should. However, if we save too much there is a danger of abuse. We should dwell on that point.

Will waste disposal companies be able to abuse the system? A company could have a licence for tipping which ran out but could restore the site a year later. Could that company demand that that expenditure be written off against corporation tax? It is not hard to imagine a waste disposal company that had finished a tipping operation and waited a couple of years then wanting to make some new capital expenditure—for new JCBs or compacting machines—for a different purpose. Could such a company undertake that expenditure, use it for site restoration and pretend that it was undertaken entirely for the restoration of the site? Could that company hoodwink the Revenue and whip off the useful part of that capital expenditure for work elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend rightly asked about what would happen on the expiry of site licences. Many of those knowledgeable about the industry are anxious about the possibility of those who hold licences surrendering them and walking away from their responsibilities. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is good to know that the Liberal Democrats are with us now. It makes us more hopeful about Thursday's proceedings on clause 99.I welcome the interjection from the sole representative of the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend consider the impact of the surrender of a site licence? Let us suppose that a licence was surrendered and that the successors in title to the land or the successors to the company recognised subsequently that the surrender was inappropriate or unfounded and then had to reapply for a licence. Will he consider the implications of that on both the Revenue and the environment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. Before the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) replies, I must ask hon. Members to be a little careful in their choice of terminology. Our proceedings are being reported, and it is wrong for hon. Members to refer to clause 99 when we are discussing clause 69. Will they refer to amendment numbers, not clause numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I stand corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South that he is not the only person to have made such a mistake. I did the same earlier this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has made a valid point; he knows more about such matters than I do. I should have thought that the authority which issued licences or planning permission would have, as part of its conditions governing the restoration of sites, a clause to stop a company simply surrendering a licence and walking away. That might not be so in every instance.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
No doubt some companies will go into liquidation before they complete restoration work. Cowboy companies might begin work in the knowledge that they will not fulfil their obligations to the community, and then disappear. If so, I wonder whether the amendments will help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can table another amendment on Report under which no expenditure can be written off against corporation tax until and unless the restoration work has been completed. I accept that some members of the Committee would argue that companies could face cash flow problems and that it would be unrealistic to expect rights against corporation tax to wait seven or 10 years until everything was completed. It is a matter of judgment. I should welcome a contribution to the debate from my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South, so that he can expand the debate. I hope that he will not be so rudely interrupted as he was previously.

I wish to return to whether the amendments would encourage tax avoidance. If any of the amendments were passed, would they be open to abuse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Opposition amendments could be open to abuse or that the Government amendments—which were endorsed by all members of the Opposition Front Bench and would achieve the same effect as their original amendment—could be the cause of abuse?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:There could be tax avoidance under any of the amendments. I must be convinced that scope for avoidance would not increase if any of the proposals were accepted. If there is a possibility of tax avoidance, the Committee would have to decide which was the better amendment.

The Financial Secretary gave no advice about those matters. His speech was three sentences long, and told us very little. As to his second point, of course we are not lighthearted or casual. If we were being casual, we would have packed up at about 6.30 pm. I would have gone for a good dinner, voted at 10 pm and would now be in bed. We take these important matters most seriously. Billions of pounds are at stake. We do not accept the charge that we are being casual, but that does not stop our putting our names to amendments tabled by the Chief Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It speaks well for the Opposition that our Front Bench Members are willing to ensure that the Bill is properly explored and subject to the full scrutiny of the Committee. We are not willing to see it rushed through without proper consideration, as encouraged by the Financial Secretary for obvious and transparent reasons. It is more necessary than usual that the Bill should be subject to proper consideration here. Unlike other legislation, the Finance Bill is not sent to another place to be further scrutinised. No, Opposition Front-Bench Members are right to take these matters seriously. It is regrettable that the Government are willing to give the Commmittee only a cursory explanation.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right—the Opposition are not being casual about such important matters. The hon. Member for Esher must agree that the Bill affects a vital and necessary industry. I said that I do not want the industry to increase exponentially, but that does not mean that I denigrate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments leave open the possibility of avoidance. I gave an example of a waste disposal company that bought tractors or JCBs apparently to restore a site, but in reality to carry on business at another site. It could be held that some expenditure was capital and that other expenditure was revenue. I call in aid an observation made by Lord Reid, which was referred to in Mr. Justice Harman's original judgment in the case of Rolfe v. Wimpey Waste Management Ltd.
Page 353 of "Simon's Tax Cases" says:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
	<br><q><p>"That clear, concise and illuminating observation, leaving the court to decide what are the circumstances, how many are 'all' and whether it is reasonable to take this or that one into account is derived directly from the great authority of Lord Reid in the Decision in Regent Oil Co Ltd v. Strick (Inspector of Taxes) 1966 AC295,43 TC1, (b)(ii). No one test is paramount in all cases; what is appropriate as a revenue deduction in one case may not be in another."</p></q>
So the Financial Secretary cannot argue that there is a clear ringfence around capital expenditure in this case, nor that there is no question of camouflaging capital expenditure as revenue. That matter has been the subject of many cases to which I and my hon. Friends have referred this evening. As that extract amply proves, there is opportunity for abuse.'

It would be useful to know whether the amendment tabled by the hon. Members for Esher and for Wyre—that hon.

I know that the hon Member for Esher is a director of one such company, and that he gets paid to speak as he does on the House.

I was dealing with the question of avoidance with reference to the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Esher and for Wyre. I mean no disrespect, but they should explain to the Committee why they tabled them. Have they dispassionately put aside their interests and do they genuinely want to improve the Bill? Do they anticipate waste disposal companies making savings because they will not have to apply for licences if those run out, or do they envisage increased scope for monetary gain by the companies because of increased chances for tax avoidance? I mean no disrespect by referring to tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is the job of accountants advising companies to maximise the possiblities of tax avoidance. If they did not do that, they would probably not be very good and would not be employed. Codes of ethics need to be obeyed, but everything is written down in our law system and it is up to accountants to do their best for their clients. However, that should not be the way in which we consider these matters in Committee. The hon. Member for Esher is entitled to table amendments that he would suggest were he an accountant in a position to advise a firm—in his case, he is a director of a waste management company. It is right that the Committee knows the reasons behind the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend refers to the ethics of the accountancy profession and the reliance that those who seek to have financial matters monitored in the interests of the Treasury, the Revenue and of justice itself—let alone of tax collection—must put on the professional integrity of accountants. I must draw my hon. Friend's attention to a recommendation of the Keith committee, which, had it been put into legislation, would have had a substantial and positive effect on the clause and the amendments and would have met my hon. Friend's point. It suggested that an accountant's obligation to his employer be tempered
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
by an obligation to the Revenue in certain circumstances. That recommednation was not put into legislation by the Government who, to their credit, have implemented other recommendations of the Keith committee. Had they implemented that recommendation, as the Labour party urged at the time, my hon. Friend's point would have been met, at least in part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. The point remains that it was not put into legislation, so is not relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I fear that you are right, Mr. Coleman, but it does bear on the Committee's work. The answer to the issue is clarity and the ability of interested parties to know what is going on. Ultimately, tax accounts should be clear to the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue. There shold be no hidden tricks, or, if there are, those should exist only until the Government decides to put an end to them. Under any circumstances it would be wrong for us to accept an amendment that seems to be above board only to discover, in a year or two, that money was being drained from the Inland Revenue and that the Committee had been culpable in accpeting the amendment.

I shall not press the hon. Member for Esher as I am sure that the hon. Member's who have tabled the amendments will give us the fullest information, but several issues are involved. Although clause 69 may not be defective, it could be improved. Difficulties will arise if licences run out and costs are incurred obtaining other licences. What expenditure incurred in the period between licences can be claimed against corporation tax? We are worried that cowboy companies may carry out part of their obligation, rake in money by tipping on the site and then leave the job, ignoring planning permission or other conditions imposed by the licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also worried about abuse, either avoiding tax or other forms. The Financial Secretary gave us nothing on which to assess the effect of the Government amendments. We should like to support one amendment—possibly Government amendment No. 165—but we do not know enough about it to vote for it with certainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I support the Government amendment. It would allow relief to be claimed although the licence has ceased to be in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier intervention, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) drew our attention to the fact that there are loopholes in the Control of Pollution Act 1974. A disposer of waste can pollute a dump site, hand in his licence and walk away. Little can be done about that. If the Government amendment would encourage those engaged in dumping to restore the site, even after their licence has elapsed, it should be welcomed. In environmental terms, a properly restored site is better than one that is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If my grandmother were alive today, she would be 126. She would have said that the amendments were a licence to print money. She would have added, "Where there's muck there's money."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend's grandmother was not a very original lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My old grandmother may not have made original remarks, but she must have been the only member of the Primrose League who read the Daily Worker. If she had stood for Parliament, it would have been as a Liberal. We appear to be giving more tax concessions to organisations that are doing very well anyway out of the Government.

As I said, I am a member of the Select Committee on Agriculture. I wonder how many of the organisations have been involved in dumping the carcases of BSE cows in these tips. We know that the cows have often been illegally dumped in tips. Not far from my home there is a tip called Blooming Heather, which sounds nice; it lies in Wordsworth country, and perhaps it was the man himself who named it. Carcases have been dumped in the tip without any regard to licences or to public safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to my hon Friend. As one who wrote a PhD on Wordsworth I cannot allow my hon Friend's comments on Cumbria's greatest poet to pass. Wordsworth would have been on the side of my hon. Friend on this issue. His letter to the Bishop of Llandaff deploring the coming of the railway shows how acutely aware the poet was of the potential environmental damage of many aspects of the industrial age, of which, I am sure, waste disposal would have been one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hope that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) will not find himself down in Llandaff, because I can assure him that there are no tips there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:As the son of an engine driver I am not sure that I agree with Wordsworth about railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact remains that the cows were placed in the tip, which was licensed, with no though of pulic helath. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) has told me that hundreds of slaughtered cattle have been placed in a tip near his constituency, and the tip leaches into a river that supplies water to the residents of Norwich. Great alarm has been caused among the people of that good city, and rightly so. Will the organisation that was responsible for that tipping be taking advantage of the amendments? The debate has been well worth while, as the more I hear of the tax concessions that even my Front Bench spokesmen are prepared to give, the more I am convinced that they are wrong. I hope that in due course my hon. Friend's will withdraw their names from the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend touched on the Government's position on tax concessions. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) went into some detail about tax avoidance and evasion, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
the grey area between them. Who are we to say that the Government do not know what is going on? I am worried about the tips and the carcases. Everyone is worried; I have taken beef off the menu in my household.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:That has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Financial Secretary woke up then, Mr. Coleman, and interrupted my intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. I am wide awake; long interventions are not helping the progress of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was about to sit down, but may I ask my hon. Friend to dwell on the grey area between tax avoidance, tax evasion and the Government's policy of giving tax handouts to their friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not sure about that. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) said that it is a great pity that my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) is not the Minister, as at least he has explained matters, which is more than the Minister has done. The Minister appears to be sulking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:No doubt it has occurred to my hon. Friend and to the rest of the Committee that if we had an election for a Minister among ourselves, my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) might well win.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not know what that has to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I should go as far as saying that it would be no contest, but you are suggesting that I must get back to the amendment, Mr. Coleman. I am being diverted by interventions, but my hon. Friends are raising important matters.

I return to illegal dumping, which the Government have not controlled by licensing. I do not understand why tax concessions should be given. Two organisations have moved into my city and taken over the collection and dumping of refuse. Biffa is a large organisation with many tips, and no doubt some Conservative Members are consultants for the company. If so, they will probably refute what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such companies take over the service and reduce the number and wages of staff; holiday and pension provisions are cut; yet the firms will now be offered tax concessions on the licences as well. That is not fair, and it goes against natural justice. I am not sure whether I can support the amendment— I may have to abstain. I may be brought up before the Whips tomorrow, but sometimes we must make stands on principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that when the tips are reinstated, the energy source is buried, to be left for five, six, eight or 10 years. After causing all that pollution, the companies will say, "We are very environmentally friendly. We shall open up the tip to take out the methane gas. We will sell it to the customers who originally provided the rubbish and make more money."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
Another reason why I believe that the amendment is wrong is that the waste disposal side of the business takes the company only half way through the process of profit. The energy extraction is another part of the business. Even then, that is not the end of the matter. Methane gas is fine for burning, but it is dangerous to build houses on such sites, and the companies will say that they have a prime site on which to build to save the green belt. They will be seen as being doubly environmentally friendly, having saved energy and provided building land.

Everyone in the Committee appears to want to give
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
such companies concessions on the licences, but that makes no sense. I wonder whether my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench have thought the matter through carefully. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham will explain why I should support the proposal—if I have not converted him. I shall not detain the Committee, as many other hon. Members are dying to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
