	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> On a point of order, Dame Janet. For the convenience of the Committee, may we also take amendment No. 450 as it, too deals with the protection of staff? I cannot speak for the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the selection of amendments is always provisional and subject to alteration, for the moment we shall take the two groups together. If the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) objects to the inclusion of his amendment in the group, I shall reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, we may also take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 450, in page 7, line 26, leave out subsection (5) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) Subsections (3) and (4) above are without prejudice to any employee's right to remain an employee of the health authority after the operational date.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5A) Where an employee exercises their right under subsection (5) above, it shall be the duty of the health authority to make arrangements for appropriate alternative employment for such an employee.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 447, in page 7, line 32, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(()) Nothing in this section shall prevent a person's employment being deemed to be continuous within the NHS for contractual purposes at anytime after the operation date of a trust, so long as that person pursues uninterrupted employment by any health service board as defined under section 4(2) above.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday, we debated the creation of self-governing trust; all the amendments are about the protection of the rights of staff during that process. I have noticed, on leafing through various papers that
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
have been prepared by health authorities contemplating self-governing trusts, that staff appear to have been replaced by "human resources". Whether we call them staff or human resources, we are dealing with an important issue. The staff make the hospitals work, and they will have to continue to provide patient care whatever arrangements we make in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is tragic that we begin by debating the rights of staff at the point of transfer, but we established last Tuesday that the staffs right to be consulted about the creation of self-governing trusts was to be set aside by the Government. Self-governing trusts will be created without staff being consulted, and even in the face of opposition — in the ballot to which I referred on Tuesday, 42 were in favour and 1,384 were against. Staff will be transferred to self-governing trusts under clause 5, irrespective of their wishes or their views on their patients' interests. That reasonably leads us to clause 6, which deals with the rights of protection of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 provides protection for staff only at the point of transfer, when they will work under the terms and conditions that applied the day before. It does not provide any protection for staff from the second day of their transfer. That is worrying staff in Health Service hospitals. Their worry is fuelled by what they have seen happen over the past six years, when the services and functions of hospitals have been handed over to private contractors. I avoid the word "privatisation" because I know that the Under Secretary of State for Scotland will object by saying that transferring functions and services to private contractors is not privatisation. However, that process has a dramatic effect on the pay and conditions of the staff who are handed over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private contractors have invariably been responsible for, lower pay, fewer superannuation rights, less holiday time and less time at work. The aim of private contractors in personnel management—they would call it human resource management—is to make full-time staff part time so that the employers can evade paying national insurance contributions, while the staff are left without national insurance rights. The profits of private contractors have, in the main, been achieved at the expense of the staff. By employing badly paid, part-time, casual staff without proper training, private contractors have generated an immense staff turnover. There is a recorded case of a private contractor having achieved staff turnover of 400 per cent. within one year. Such rapid turnover disrupts attempts to create good working teams onwards in the interests of patient care and means that staff have no opportunity to gain experience or develop knowledge of the work expected of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff anxiety provides the background of my argument. But there is a more pertinent reason why staff should be nervous at the prospect of self-governing trusts. Documents which occasionally leach out of the fifth floors of RHA offices show that in the regions, and no doubt in the districts also, people are already thinking about how self-governing trusts might use their freedom after independence from the NHS. A document entitled, "Let's put Patients Before Profits", has been produced, for internal use only, by the Trent RHA. Had it claimed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
to put staff before profits, it would have been entirely wrong. In that respect, at least, it has been honestly named. But it might more appropriately have been named, "Let's Put Profits Before Staff'. Throughout the document, staff management is referred to as "human resource management".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall share with the Committee four sections of the document, to show the new attitudes of the Trent RHA towards its human resources. Page 9 offers advice to managers contemplating the creation of a self-governing trust. Management and Staff are regarded not as part of a joint venture but as being in opposition. Human resources are to be exploited and manipulated by tactics, as the following quote will show:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be an appropriate tactic from the first day of the establishment of the Self-Governing Trust not to confer recognition on any organisation in order that the Self-Governing Trust can pick the appropriate time and opportunity to begin to enter into discussions for recognition of collective bargaining purposes."</p></blockquote>
The document mentions picking an appropriate time, not to recognise collective bargaining purposes but to begin to enter into discussions on the recognition of trade unions. The logical corollary of that statement is that there will be no accepted means of collective bargaining. On page 10, the document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Self Governing Trust will have a choice. It may choose not to enter into collective bargaining arrangements. It may choose to continue to adopt the Whitley Pay Strategy or alternatively it may seek to impose pay deals."</p></blockquote>
I ask my hon. Friends to note those final words. The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Trust will also need to have a clear view of its pay strategy and whether it chooses to move totally to individual remuneration packages and away from collective agreements."</p></blockquote>
It contains no assurances on trade union recognition or on collective bargaining agreements, even with organisations such as the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel or any staff union that the self-governing trust may create. There is not even a minimal assurance that there will be a collective organisation of any sort, to say nothing of a recognised and registered trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document hints at what the changes might imply for staff pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, a paragraph on page 13, headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Abandoning Whitley in respect of a particular Staff Group"</p></blockquote>
makes a distinction between staff for whom there is competition in the labour market and staff for whom there is not. The doom-laden words written about those for whom there is not competition are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the issue is one of lack of competitiveness, buying out the staff group may not be a viable option as this would merely increase costs when the defined problem was that costs were already too high."</p></blockquote>
I invite my hon. Friends to peer through those elliptical phrases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the management of the Trent RHA states that the defined problem is that costs are already too high, it is effectively saying that the staff are being paid too much. As I go around hospitals not many staff press me on that problem; the converse is the defined problem for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
The solution to the problem, as defined by Trent RHA, is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The options here appear to be ... to 'red circle' the existing work force".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether the term red-circling has as yet entered the medical dictionary. I am not familiar with the process, but I can infer what it means from
	<br><blockquote><p>"and offer different rates to new starters".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the RHA proposes a two-tier system of wage settlements in its hospitals. There will be those who were taken on under existing pay and conditions, as clause 6 does not give self-governing trusts the opportunity to dishonour existing pay and condition agreements. Those staff will find that their pay and conditions, which clause 6 purports to protect, are further protected by red-circling. Therefore staff within the ambit of clause 6 will not be able to improve on their pay and conditions, or even achieve annual rises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is naturally painting the blackest possible picture for staff. However, there is considerable evidence from the past 10 years and from a wide range of organisations to show that many staff earn much more when managements are free to make their own wage arrangements than when they are part of a national system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a very interesting point, which I shall come to. However, I ask him to reflect on the context in which he inadvisedly made that point. Its original context was a paragraph issued by the senior management of one. It distinguishes between two separate staff sectors: one in which it perceived that competition to recruit staff would exist, and one in which it did not. Nevertheless the hon. Gentleman has made a valid point which should be of interest to those who wish to protect the public purse and the interests of staff for whom there is competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Trent region, however, the hon. Gentleman's remark will be perceived as wide of the mark for the group that I have high-lighted. The staff who do not find that there is a seller's market for their unskilled labour require the protection of statutes, trades union rights and collective bargaining if their lack of bargaining power is not to be exploited by unscrupulous employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Trent RHA reflects how it might go about changing pay and conditions in the new environment of self-governing trusts by suggesting that those changes should be handled by "consultation but not negotiation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, this is the end of the right to collective bargaining and the introduction of a system that plainly imposes on management less stringent demands for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What causes nervousness among Labour Ministers is that during our extended debate in the last sitting we saw how fragile and marginal an interpretation Conservative Ministers put upon the word "consultation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of this document, the comments of the Select Committee on Social Services seem a studied understatement. In its report last March the Select Committee warned that the new self-governing trusts "will have far-reaching consequences" for the Whitley council and pay in the NHS. It added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe they could signal the death knell for the Whitley councils in the NHS at least as currently constituted."</p></blockquote>
A number of rights of staff are at issue. As we have seen from the document, they include the right to recognition of a trade union; the right to collective bargaining; and the right to be protected against having individual remuneration imposed on them I emphasise the word "imposed".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a constituency with many Japanese companies. They are welcome to take advantage of the interesting advanced technology and skilled work force there. The system of individual remuneration which is almost always practised by those companies, however, has some startling consequences. In one company some of my constituents found that they had been denied a full increase and had had a pay rise that was less than the rate of inflation. When querying it, they were told that they had shown a lack of commitment to the company. When they enquired how they had demonstrated that lack of commitment, it emerged that those who had been offered an increase lower than the rate of inflation had all taken the full holiday entitlement of three weeks in the preceding year. They had no recourse, because they had no trade union rights. They had no right to collective bargaining. Theyt had to accept the system of individual remuneration to which the hon. Gentleman from Mid-Kent (Mr Rowe) referred, and which we may see in operation in some hospitals in our Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it ever occurred to the hon. Gentleman to make a connection between the Japanese management practices to which he referred and the remarkable performance of the Japanese economy, to which both sides of the House regularly pay tribute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the practice that I have just described has contributed to the profits of Japanese companies. I put it delicately, but there is a feeling in some quarters of my constituency that staff in Japan are renumerated rather more generously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Oppenheim 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Amber Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps productivity is higher in Japan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Gentleman, who has emerged from his chess set to join in the exchanges that productivity in my constituency bears comparison with productivity anywhere. He will not find Japanese employers complaining about the skills or prodctivity of the work force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that I had emerged from my chess set. If he thinks that he can find a chess set in front of me, he is welcome to try. I have none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept that correction. We shall of course look to see that there is no chess set in front of the hon. Gentleman during the rest of the sitting. I sense that the hon. Gentleman is not allowed to take part in these preceedings; and, we read in the papers, no longer allowed to attend private meetings with the Secretary of State. I have no objection to his playing computer chess. I find it an entertaining pastime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I object to irrelevancies on amendments that were otherwise being argued perfectly reasonably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely going to ask, Dame Janet, whether at the end of our proceedings on 27 February, or whenever we reach them, the hon. Gentleman could give us for our entertainment the score between himself and the computer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to move onto another right of staff at issue—the right of staff now in a national agreement to remain in it. It would be perfectly legitimate for the self-governing trusts to seek to offer a negotiated package to their staff which would provide for local remuneration. What concerns the staff if that they may not have such a negotiation and may be removed by force majeur from the protection of national agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to staff who are at present within the pay review board ambit when they move into a self-governing trust? When the pay review body awards an increase to nurses, will self-governing trusts honour it? It is clear from clause 5 that the trusts will not be funded to pay for that award, and if they can pay for it only out of the price of the contracts, they are unlikely to wish to uphold the award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the right of staff to superannuation. Many staff, particularly salaried staff, move from hospital to hospital, which provides a degree of mobility in the Health Service which is warmly welcomed and helpful to it, but what will happen to the staff if they move from one employer to another, from a self-governing trust into a health authority, for example, and then perhaps back to another self-governing trust? Will their superannuation rights be protected, and will there be an attempt to develop and protect a common superannuation fund?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters are not solely of concern to the staff; they raise profound issues of public interest. For example, the hon. Minister for Mid-Kent said that in the new environment, in which there will be individual negotiations for individual employers and employees, some individual employees may do very well, which I cheerfully concede.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the present labour market in the NHS, I believe that the new fractured labour market will have two consequences. First, the trend will be that wages and conditions at the bottom of that labour market will be depressed, as unskilled personnel find themselves exploited. I have dwelt on that point and it is unmistakeably in the minds of managers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a simultaneous trend at the top end of the labour market, when doctors and nurses with high qualifications for the first time find that there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
competition for their labour. One advantage to the public purse of the present NHS is that it is a monopoly employer and can therefore exploit that strength when it negotiates with people who have skills to sell. Doctors in Britain are not well-paid compared with doctors in the rest of Europe, which partly reflects the way in which the present bargaining arrangement strengthens the hand of the public purse against the professsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the new environment, doctors will probably be more expensive, because hospitals will be locked into a system of leap-frogging against each other for the skilled labour of doctors and well-qualified nurses. That will not necessarily produce a more cost-effective Health Service, and it will certainly widen pay differentials within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue of public concern is what the cost of the new arrangements will be. Conservative Ministers are much given to criticising the present system of settling pay in the Health Service as cumbersome and remote, and there are undeniably problems with that remoteness, but the system is centralised and comparatively cheap. If all major hospitals have their own department of human resource management, it will add to their considerable additional expenditure and, perhaps more significantly, create a major diversion of management time into personnel management, staff negotiation and settling of conditions, activities which at present do not distract them from the proper provision of patient care to their local community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman giving way to me a second time. The problem for Conservative Ministers is not so much that the present system of pay determination in the NHS is remote as that it is highly inefficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It involves setting national standards for certain types of labour which do not reflect either the demand and supply of that labour or the demand and supply of that labour in different parts of the country. We end up paying too much for some categories of labour in some parts of the country—a waste of resources—and too little—resulting in shortages—in other parts of the country or in other specialities. The present system is a rejection of the price mechanism in the labour market, and that cannot be efficient. If this is a move towards a greater degree of differential, as the hon. Member for Livingston suggests, it can only be a more effective way of allocating scarce labour resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should consider what has been happening recently in pay determination in the NHS. For instance, last year's settlement in clerical administrative pay provided an enormous degree of local flexibility along a national pay spine which now has 48 points on which local managers can exert local discretion and flexibility. At this very moment, similar negotiations are taking place in relation to the pay of ancillary workers. The two have a common theme: a national agreement that provides a floor for the protection of staff, plus local flexibility for management. Here we are faced with the fracturing of that national pay spine and the loss of that protection—a loss which I am bound to say will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
fuelled by the remarks of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) who, candidly and fairly, said that part of the problem, as the Government see it, is that some NHS staff are paid too much. That is what fuels the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to amendment No. 450. If Ministers do not care for amendments Nos. 355 and 356, which provide protection of trade union rights to negotiate in advance the collective bargaining arrangements— those are the amendments that we prefer—we offer them an alternative in amendment No. 450. It proposes that the individual member of staff-Conservative Ministers like to stress the individual rights of staff—should have the right to say, "I am worried about what will happen to my pay and conditions under a self-governing trust. I did not vote for its creation; I do not wish to work for it. I therefore wish to exercise an option to remain employed by the DHA under my present terms and conditions." There is no such right in clause 6. Subsection (5) merely states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsections… above are without prejudice to any right of an employee to terminate his contract of employment if a substantial change is made to his detriment in his working conditions".</p></blockquote>
In other words, any employee has the right to resign. The subsection is, in my estimation, somewhat redundant, because it is difficult to see how the right to leave a job and resign could be taken away from staff. The Conservative Government's employment legislation has not yet reached that stage. Patently, whether the subsection is a dead letter or not, it does not offer any meaningful degree of protection to staff in our existing hospitals, and if Ministers want to overcome the massive opposition that we described on Tuesday, they should accept that it is necessary to extend to staff guarantees and protections which are not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began by referring to documents which said that staff were human resources who should be managed, not negotiated. Many of the opening paragraphs of those documents contain purple passages about human resources being the Health Service's most valuable resources and that their skill and experience are the resources on which the Health Service will go forward. But it is not just a matter of skill and experience; it is also commitment, and commitment of staff to the NHS is one of its greatest resources. Failure to protect staff when they enter the commercial market and to recognise their anxieties will seriously damage that commitment. I hope that Ministers will respond more positively to this amendment than they have to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Terms and conditions in the NHS are not uniform in one respect at present. During the last general election, one of my constituents, Mrs Rowling, who lives in the village of Culworth, drew my attention to an anomaly in the structure of pay and conditions in the NHS. I sometimes believe that we would not know what was happening here unless our constituents told us. I took up the matter later but there was no satisfactory solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
Mrs. Rowling joined the NHS in 1965. She became pregnant in 1987 and now has a healthy son. In her long service she worked for several RHAs. In 1985, she transferred from the Trent RHA to the Oxford RHA. There was no substantial difference in her job but because she had switched from one region to another she did not receive maternity pay. It was claimed that there had been a break in service. That is unfair. Ministers may want to consider ways of rectifying that anomaly, which has a bearing on social security benefits too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The existing pay structures in the NHS should be tackled at the outset. The Government are treating the NHS like a house. They fail to repair it and they let damp spread up the wall and the tiles blow off the roof. They then announce that the structure is no longer fit to live in and seek permission to demolish it. They have allowed pay structures in the NHS to collapse and disintegrate. The existing Whitley Council system is creaking on its knees: it is too fragmented. It lacks the essential information that is required to target staff shortages in the NHS. For example, there is no information about staff recruitment and turnover in speech therapy, a discipline that the Minister knows well. The existing pay structure has been undermined from within for 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speech therapy is in disarray because of the rigidities of the Whitley system. It is impossible for that wholly graduate profession to find a slot within the Whitley Council machinery and to receive the remuneration that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely my point. The Government have allowed the Whitley Council system to freeze in this way, and they have failed to co-operate in collecting the relevant information. Honourable Members on both side of the Committee have asked questions about a range of professions ancillary to medicine, of which speech therapy is but one example, and the constant answer is that the Department has no records on recruitment and turnover problems. No labour market can function efficiently without the basic information to enable it to function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my text to some degree from the example which the honourable Member for Mid-Kent has provided of speech therapy. We stand now at an exciting point in the treatment of illness, for which there are entirely new techniques which were unknown five and 10 years ago, and entirely new ways of supporting people who are already ill in order to raise the quality of their life are becoming available. Many of the new professions, which do not fit easily into the traditional structure of the Whitley Council machinery, whose members are not easily classified as nurses or doctors but fall somewhere in between, and where levels of training are of necessity extremely high, are precisely the professions that will have to be developed the most quickly to take advantage of the new opportunities. That is why we are anxious about what will happen to those professions in the schemes for the NHS trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
Let me give two examples. First, in NHS trusts, research teams employed by universities will work alongside front-line implementation teams employed by the major teaching hospitals. The effective development of their respective disciplines to raise the levels of treatment and explore the new avenues which now exist requires that the two teams work together. Unless we can have assurances about what the schemes proposed by clause 6 will be, we risk fragmenting those teams, and no one can predict what the consequences will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take much to heart the apparent contradiction noted by my honourable Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). He is right. Pay and conditions will be downgraded in some sectors of the professions and there will be vast increases in salaries in others, and they are not large professions. There are only 900 medical physicists, 1,200 clinical biochemists, and 2,500 speech therapists. The potential for smashing the labour market, in which a handful of those people will then be able to monopolise particular skills in particular places while the rest of the profession goes to the wall, is enormous. Raising the levels of treatment across the board and taking advantage of the new opportunities depends precisely on maintaining the integrity of the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend agree that one of the most interesting aspects of his statistics on speech therapy is the wide variation in provision from one part of the country to another which they reflect? Does he agree also that if market conditions are introduced, the variations will become wider?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. I have personal knowledge of the speech therapy service in Newcastle, and in the figures for the northern region Newcastle stands out as an apparent centre of excellence for speech therapy. The provision of speech therapy per head is far higher in Newcastle than in the rest of the region, but what is the reality? The centre in Newcastle is so short of speech therapists that it cannot take on serious cases. It can take only the less serious cases because they can be treated more quickly. In some cities, speech therapists are employed on an agency basis, as and when necessary. There should be continuous support for hospital services. Thousands of children, elderly people suffering from strokes and people with communication disorders resulting from trauma or accident are being abandoned. They are denied a vital service which would make a considerable difference to the quality of their lives because their problems are too serious. That is happening in a city which appears to be a centre of excellence for speech therapy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the proposals do for the limited professions? Some of the Dryburn hospital laboratories in the city of Durham have been rented to vets to generate income for the NHS. What an extraordinary system! That is why we are so anxious about the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my constituents is caught up in the new arrangements. As part of his transfer to a private organisation known as Greatorex, he has been offered
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
certain terms and conditions, one of which is membership of BUPA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no health insurance in his present terms and conditions because he is an NHS employee. There could be no better testimony to clause 6: people who work in scarce disciplines in the NHS are offered alternative employment in the private sector with BUPA membership. That is why we fear the creation of a two-tier service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State mentioned lithotripsy, a new technique for dispersing kidney stones and gallstones without the need for surgery. It is heavy on capital and light on revenue and is usually operated by medical scientists. Where in clause 6 is a provision that would ensure the integrity of such professions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A decent salary structure and adequate training is needed to retain the staff who carry out new techniques such as chemical diagnosis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS has to deal with more humble matters, one of which is the massive, hidden problem of incontinence. I spoke to a team of medical physicists who spent a long time designing incontinence pads of different textures, shapes and structures for specific conditions. That is a narrow use of scarce resources, but unless the teams working on such conditions are retained there will be no new discoveries and the NHS needs high standards of comfort and care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occupational therapy is another good example. Goodness knows how community care will work without increasing the number of occupational therapists from the 4,000-5,000 currently employed in Britain. Every director of social services is screaming out for occupational therapists. Without them, people cannot be supported in the community or given skills to deal with new devices that improve the quality of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a similar need for occupational therapists in hospitals. They often work there to support people recovering from serious accidents, which is the major killer of people under 40, and the major defect in the quality of life of that age group. Occupational therapy skills are heavily used by that group. We must find a way to protect occupational therapists in the NHS, and use them to train more therapists. That would help to meet all the hidden needs that are not met at present which is why we have tabled the amendments. Will the Minister tell us how she will protect the interests of the health professions which are important in changing the NHS? They will make it into a service that is targeted at what happens in hospital, at the problems that cause people to go into hospital, and at the support that they receive in the communtiy after they have left hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman for Mid-Kent (Mr Rowe) who has just left the Committee, referred to labour market problems. Many professions, such as speech therapists or occupational therapists are overwhelmingly staffed by women. As a result, they have tried to establish themselves as professions, or to acquire pay structures that are appropriate for a highly-trained profession. One of our aims, which lies behind the amendments, is to promote the interests of profes-
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
sions that are dominated by women rather than by men, and to match them in status, reputation and significance with those dominated by men. We would ensure that hidden discrimination in women's occupational prospects and promotional chances was removed. It is clear that the structure of these professions is not like that in medicine. There are few people at the senior levels of therapy work, but they are mostly men. We would ensure that the hidden professions, on whom the future quality of NHS care depends, were not lost or forgotten; they would be given their proper place in the sun, whatever system is devised for the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify a couple of issues that NHS staff are worried about. First, will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify the position on pensions? Presumably, when NHS trusts are set up and are free to negotiate pay and conditions, they will also be free to set up their own pension schemes. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the NHS staff who transfer to a trust can remain members of the NHS superannuation scheme? It is a good and widely-respected scheme, so I hope that they will have the freedom to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly NHS employees are covered by NHS injury-benefit regulations. All NHS employees are liable to suffer industrial injuries, especially nurses who work with the mentally ill or have to lift patients. The regulations list the employing authorities to which they apply. Will my hon. Friend confirm that she will take steps to ensure that NHS trusts will be added to that list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs. Alice Mahon (Halifax)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) summed it up when he said that we have experience of flexible pay in the NHS because many jobs have been subject to competitive tendering. We know what has happened to the work force and the service after contracts have been awarded to the private sector. Staff cannot be divorced from the delivery of the service to the patients. They are inextricably linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DHA in the area which I represent allowed the tender for domestic services to go to Mediclean. As my hon. Friend Member for Livingston said, it is easy to win a tender with such a work force. It was a classic case. Calderdale health authority employed 250 full-time domestics. All were made redundant; only 140 restarted. They lost a quarter of their pay through loss of bonus, holiday pay, pension rights and sickness benefits. They were given unachievable performance levels, and so pay and conditions were considerably worse. They did twice as much work for three quarters of the money. There was a massive staff turnover— over 100 per cent. after the first year. There were added burdens on the nursing staff, especially the sisters who have control of the wards. The wards were dirtier. It was a loss-leader contract. It has been renegotiated and costs more now, but the service has suffered. The work force suffered. The local economy suffered because people were paid less. It was a nightmare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Da vies) used the phrase "highly inefficient", and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
we were discussing supply and demand, one would have thought that he was talking about high pay scales. But in the non-supervisory grades in that ancillary service staff start at scale A on £2.38 per hour. That is now, not three years ago. The highest rate in that grade, and there are 15 pay points within it, is £2.80 per hour. I defy any Conservative Member to say that is well paid. But staff are now paid 25 per cent. less than that in Calderdale because of the private tender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contracting out of the laundry service in Calderdale has had national coverage, and rightly so. About 45 NHS laundry workers, all women, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) said, lost their jobs. They were all low paid on a pay scale the same as or similar to the ones that I have described. It was an exercise in ideology gone mad, in privatise and be damned. The contract for the laundry service in Halifax was won by in-house staff—on the first occasion by a margin of £18,000. It was checked by the RHA auditors. After much persuasion, the Minister allowed the contract to be retendered. So we went through the exercise again, with the DHA, the local trade unions and staff associations all working hard together and recognising that a laundry is fundamental to a health service. After much lobbying, and possibly because the 1983 election was on the horizon—I am sorry that the Secretary of State for Health is not here because he was Minister for Health at the time— a new scheme to include Dewsbury was submitted with three other options. The winning tender was £250,000 cheaper than the nearest private tender. However, after the Conservatives won the general election and after months of dilly-dallying the contract went to the nearest private tender and that was a disastrous decision. After promises that the contractor might give the NHS staff jobs—an impractical suggestion as they lived in Halifax—45 low-paid women were sacked. During the transitional period the management made the serious suggestion that nurses should moonlight by taking washing home. The local press photographed huge piles of linen which were almost combusting, and much of it had to be destroyed. The impact upon patients was disgraceful; elderly women had to endure the degrading experience of not having knickers, vests or petticoats; there were paper sheets on beds; and babies without clean cot blankets. That experience of contracts was a disaster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us who have worked in the Health Service and who have seen what an excellent service ward domestics, and the women in the laundry provide, feel very angry about the disastrous exercise of competitive tendering. We recognise that other things are far more important than money when caring for elderly patients who totally depend on
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
others. Often ward domestics do far more than just clean wards. They are sister's eyes and ears when dealing with the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They help feed patients, and often save lives because they notice and talk to patients. A good health service is about team work and domestics are part of the team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept the amendment the NHS will disintegrate even further. There will be not only a two-tier system, but an inadequate system, which does not care for the patients, with managers who never visit wards and who just care about accountants balance sheets. That will take care out of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will show sympathy for the experiences that I have outlined, and give a constructive response. I hope that Conservative Members understand the pay scales that I have outlined which are outrageous and have been deliberately driven down.

personal aspersions are extremely damaging and do not help arguments. The best arguments that I have heard in this place have been those in which personal allusions did not feature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for correspondence, my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) and I went to a meeting at Sevenoaks. My hon. Friend was given documentary evidence of correspondence sent. I received that correspondence and was told that it had been sent, yet it has been denied. What does one do? Should I simply presume that it was lost in the mail? Representations from around the country have been made to Conservative Members, and they know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak to two amendments and then comment generally on the others. We debate these proposals within the new climate that will exist among self-governing trusts. Recently I used the word "enterprise" as being a description of the new self-governing trusts. A number of Conservative Members interjected to take exception to my choice of word. I now have evidence of the use of that word within what the Tories call "the business"—a document to which my hon. Friend referred. It is headed "Strictly Confidential" and is entitled "Paper for General Managers of Self-Governing Trusts. Personnel Policy and Practice. The Challenge for SGTS." It is produced by Mr. Brian Edwards, and I understand that Mr Edwards was in for the job which Mr. Nicholls subsequently secured. He is also a close friend of the Secretary of State. The paper is written by a prominent person in the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opening sentence states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This paper identifies opportunities for business development and progress presented by the concept of self-governing hospitals, which can be achieved through an imaginative approach to human resource management".</p></blockquote>
It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have made some assumptions". In the short term that revenues of SGTs will match inherited contracts of employment pay bills. There will be an initial period of stability and no immediate crisis".</p></blockquote>
Referring to the medium term, it states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"SGTs will begin to lose control over income. There will be ratinalisation and"—</p></blockquote>
the critical words—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"contraction of services".</p></blockquote>
There is therefore an admission by that man, referring to the running of these new businesses and to the enterprise, that the term "contraction of services" means that the Government accept in advance that there will be a rundown of some services in those hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document contains further interesting quotes. I quote them because it is in the context of this new culture—the transformation from a public service to a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
business and an enterprise—that bargaining and trade union recognition will occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It mentions that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the labour costs of the enterprise constituting four fifths of the operating costs of the business"—</p></blockquote>
again, those precious words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"have tended to be treated as a virtually fixed given. Whitley rates of pay and conditions of service were sacrosanct".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In future, unit managers will have on offer the prospect of genuine control of the biggest single element of a highly labour intensive"</p></blockquote>
here comes that word again—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"business … Genuine and substantial variability in the organisation and deployment of the NHS's human resources in self-governing hospitals may not only become, in time, the biggest single identifiable characteristic of those units, but may probably represent the biggest area of opportunity for achieving a successful enterprise".</p></blockquote>
Internal documents are riddled with references to business and enterprise, and it is in that context that the trade unions should see their role in bargaining with employers—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"by reducing costs".</p></blockquote>
We all know what "reducing costs" means. It does not mean reducing the costs of consultants, because, as I said on Tuesday, these costs will inevitably rise. This working document is examining ways of cutting costs by way of further contractorisation. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any self-governing trust which sets out to fly by the seat of its corporate pants"—</p></blockquote>
note the word "corporate"—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
without a coherent set of principles, or values or human resource strategy, each of which are clearly consonant with its major operational goals, will be surely bound to fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it is corporate language. It does not talk about hospitals failing in normal language; it refers to a sort of corporate failure. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We expect that the most successful units will not just be judged in clinical terms, but will be those in which there is also a clearly evident spirit of corporateness".</p></blockquote>
There is the word again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"…those who fail to rise to that challenge weill surely go to the wall. .. As no man is an island entire unto himself, neither will be a self-governing unit. Autonomous business centres"—</p></blockquote>
note the term—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"will, we presume, remain part of a corporate enterprise".</p></blockquote>
Here we have a senior manager in the NHS reflecting on and writing about the new culture that will surround the operation of these new self-governing trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend find the words "patient" or "care" anywhere in the document? I cannot find them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I turn to relationships with staff. The document says in paragraph 3.12—a memorable paragraph:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Suppose people in key positions manifest a lack of commitment to organisational goals, ideals and values? What then?

here come those precious words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"getting rid of people in key leadership positions right throughout an SGT.
If an SGT values teamwork—it needs to confront the obstructive and the prima-donna when all else has failed to persuade individuals to sign up to a corporate philosophy. Failure to confront would be a denial of that philosophy's importance".</p></blockquote>
In other words, those who do not like the new commercial culture should get out. It is saying to those people, "We don't want you. We don't want you involved, irrespective of whether you have given a lifetime's work in this sphere of public service'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health is making gestures, as though he is expecting me to calm down and relax. The whole Bill makes me exceedingly angry, because I know in my heart that it is wrong. The Minister is changing the underlying philosophy and culture of the NHS. He is turning it into a business. My forefathers and Socialists going back 10,20,50, 100 years—certainly, Socialists before the war—dreamt about what Aneurin Bevan created, and their successors do not want to see it dismantled. But that is what the Bill does and that is why Socialists are so angry about it.

We see the danger when we read documents like this that refer openly, though it is a secret document, to the corporate nature of the enterprise and the business philosophy: it would take a quick Bill in the mid-1990s, assuming that the Tories were in office, to transform these trusts into private-enterprise operations and float them on the market. Can any Conservative Member deny that a quick Bill, containing little more than a couple of sentences, could transform what is being created in this Bill into a wholly private Health Service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) may not believe that this is the Government's intention, but on Monday 30 November 1987, a seminar was organised by the Carlton club. I am sure, Dame Janet, that you would not know what the Carlton club is, because you are a very reasonable person and Chairman of the Committee. There are some members of the Committee, however, who know all about it, I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr Forsyth), is in regular contact with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Carlton club is a very Right-wing organisation which, in association with the Conservative Medical Society at 69 James Street, London, held a seminar on the NHS and the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Does what the hon. Gentleman is about to say relate to the amendments;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then he must relate it to them pretty quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so in my very next sentence, Dame Janet. One of its recommendations was to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage the disbanding of old fashioned trade unions such as COHSE and NUPE".</p></blockquote>
you will admit, Dame Janet, that nothing could bring me more into order than that. It also recommended:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There should be a move from a centralised to a devolved service." The seminar was held only three months before the working party was set up to produce recommendations which are contained in the Bill, and to that extent, it has influenced the content of the legislation.</p></blockquote>
Let us consider the seminar's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There should be a move from a centralised to a devovled service".</p></blockquote>
That is in the Bill. The second states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There should be an increase in joint ventures between the NHS and the private sector to create an integrated and inter-related market".</p></blockquote>
That is in the Bill. The third states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Individual hospitals should opt out, instilling a competitive element into the system".</p></blockquote>
That is in the Bill. The fourth is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An informative system should be urgently developed in order to identify and reward efficiency".</p></blockquote>
In effect, that is in the Bill. The fifth states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tax relief on health insurance should be introduced in order to encourage the further growth of the private sector".</p></blockquote>
That is well in hand because of what happened in the Budget last year. I wonder whether I am a little out of order, Dame Janet, and perhaps should not press this too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
The sixth is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Patients and/or GPs should be permitted to select their consultant, their hospital and their specialist unit if they require treatment".</p></blockquote>
That is in the Bill. All those recommendations are in the Bill. One or two recommendations of that seminar remain to be implemented. One is the encouragement of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the disbanding of old-fsahioned trade unions such as COHSE and NUPE".</p></blockquote>
Another, which is significant to the amendment, is the dismantling of what is referred to as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the 'out of date' Whitley council system".</p></blockquote>
That is the agenda of Government. That is why they want to do and what, in the creation of self-governing trusts, they intend to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer back to Mr. Edwards's interesting document, "Paper for General Managers of Self-Governing Hospital Trusts", which I presume was fairly well circulated within the NHS. On the subject of trade union recognition, which I believe is relevant to amendment No. 356, the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Self-Governing Trust will need to take decisions at early stages as to whether it would wish to recognise any StafFSide organisation for collective bargaining purposes and to what extent".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) mentioned that earlier when he referred to this statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be an appropriate tactic from the first day of the establishment of the Self-Governing Trust not to confer recognition on any organisation in order that the Self-Governing Trust can pick the appropriate time and opportunity to begin to enter into discussions for recognition for collective bargaining purposes."</p></blockquote>
Later in the document we see the context in which that statement is made. Under the heading "manpower and Training Strategies", it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These must be designed to meet the requirements and objectives of the business plan, and in terms of the provision of the required quantity and quality of staff the SGT will be faced with three choices:
	<ol>
	<li>to develop and train their staffing requirements (grow their own trees).</li>
	<li>To recruit direct staff having the required skills and experience already (poaching)."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
"Poaching" is the term used. A senior manager in the NHS, commenting on the operation of self-governing trusts, has advocated poaching as a way of securing of filling the labour demands of a self-governing trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third choice is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"c) To provide certain services under a 'Contract of Services' rather than 'Contract of Employment' (Competitive Tendering)."</p></blockquote>
In that document it is also stated:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"There would also be non-Core Groups who although still essential to achieve objectives would be more vulnerable to considerations for contracting-out. This Group would comprise of hotel services, portering,"—</p></blockquote>
I hope that all the NHS workers throughout the country involved in the jobs that I am about to list take note. The document goes on to refer to "pharmacy, laboratories, personnel administration".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
That is how it is intended to keep the administration figures down. It will not be necessary to admit to higher administration costs in the NHS for direct labour because it will simply be contracted out and perhaps shown under another heading. As I was saying, the document refers to
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"portering, pharmacy, laboratories, personnel administration, salary and wages, audit, supplies, fincancial services, possibly,"</p></blockquote>
and other areas. Those are the areas which the people who will be involved in the trusts—I am sure that Mr. Edwards will be well rewarded for his efforts; he will probably get a very decent trust, if that is what he wants—are already indentifying in advance as those requiring contractorisation and privatisation generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I have tabled amendments to try to redress the problems that will arise, but the clause will mean a reduction in wages for those who have what Conservative Members have referred to as menial tasks in the NHS and an escalation in salaries for consultants and those who are able to manipulate the self-governing trusts. There will be extensive privatisation, more representations to Members of Parliament as the terms and conditions of workers decline, and the poaching of labour, to the cost of directly managed hospitals in a new two-tier NHS system under which the public in many parts of the country will eventually suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments, because one of the great problems facing major employers, including the NHS is the prospect of a shortage of young people to be recruited during the next decade. This is a demographic fact, and fears on this count have been relayed to me by various people in the Mid Glamorgan health authority in my area—by the unit general manager of the largest of our hospitals, consultants and nursing officers. They say that their recruitment problems have been made no easier by the prevailing low levels of pay for many crucial hospital staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There fears about the Bill and clause 6 in particular, are wholly understandable. How can they convince young people in the 1990s that hospital employment will ensure the basic elements of security and decent pay when there is not even a whisper in the Bill about the continuity of standards of contract and targets for quality of employment prospects? That must be made clearer if the hospital trusts are to be seen as anything other than the last dead-end stop on the job train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek reassurance from the Minister that the hospital trusts will be required to implement the Government's declared objective of promoting equal opportunities inside the NHS. The progress towards equal opportunities has been slow but most welcome. Only the most Philistine of free marketeers—I know we have some, but they would have to be very Philistine—would deny that the chances of employment currently in the NHS for discabled people, people from ethnic minorities and those in society, for example, who may not have attained the educational qualifications which earlier in their careers would have provided them with job advancement, are of great importance now. I think that the Government recognise, albeit in a limited way, the critical need to
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
provide facilities and services, such as maternity leave, which encourage staff to make the fullest use of their training and expertise and either to remain with the NHS or to return to it. I should like the Minister to reassure the Committee that under the Bill there will be continuity of the sort which I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly on amendments Nos. 355 and 450.I was delayed this morning because I alone of Members of this Committee, I think, served on the Football Spectators Bill, and looking at the two pieces of legislation, I have a sense of deja vu. I and other Opposition Members, I am sure, are delighted at the news that the provisions of the Football Spectators Bill—now an Act, of course—are not to be implemented. I raise the matter not to take the argument away from the Health Service but to point out that many of us who served on that Bill deployed exactly the same arguments as we are deploying on this Bill. We warned the Ministers then, as we warn them now, that the scheme did not have popular support and that when the Bill's provisions were ready to be implemented, the Government would have to back down and admit that they had made a terrible mistake. That, of course, is precisely what Opposition Members have been saying since this Bill entered Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to provide a degree of legal protection to the people who make up the Health Service. If one listened to the views of Conservative Members, one would imagine that the NHS existed to support the careers of those who wished to become general managers and leaders of the Conservative party rather than the livelihood of those who are the essence of the Health Service, the men and women who work in it. We wish to provide them with the same legal protection which they had as DHA employees. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the legal rights which have been accepted as part of our way of life in the NHS for many decades, certainly since its foundation, are protected, and to give people who do not wish to be transferred to NHS trusts the choice of being made redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong and a fundamentally ill conceived principle that those who are currently working for one employer should suddenly be turned over to a new employer who is more likely than not, because of the budgetary restraints, to be unscrupulous. For the reasons advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and others, the people who work in the NHS must be guaranteed certain fundamental rights of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that progress has been made in taking action against employers who do not pay enough and in employing women and black and Asian people. It is right also that progress is not being made as we would wish. If the Government transfer employees from the DHA to the new health administration, it will rob them of their present rights. We seek only to give them the same protection which they had before and that a choice, so that if they prefer to leave the employment of the health authority, they will be able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) in his excellent speech, especially on speech therapy, laboratory technicians, scientific officers and others and the problems of their recruitment and pay. Although there have been lobbies of Parliament and many representations to the Department of Health about their pay and conditions, those problems have not been resolved satisfactorily, and the recruitment problem continues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have little time. That problem is exacerbated in my health authority—a problem that has been brought to the Under-Secretary's attention. Although he is not in his seat, I hope that the Minister will bring my comments today to his attention. We have an outstanding meeting with the Minister about the financial crisis in South Manchester, with 100 job freezes and a shortage of speech therapists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am angry because the health authority has given a £50,000 loan to Wythenshawe hospital to reopen a closed ward for private patients. That loan could be used to open the wards that were closed through underfunding and to recruit staff, such as speech therapists, to ease the desperate shortage. This is the thin end of the wedge introducing, or extending, private health care in the NHS. When trusts are set up, the two-tier system of private and public provision will be exacerbated only because of the massive underfunding of NHS resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) has asked a general question about the pension arrangements in NHS trusts to which I hope the Minister will reply in detail, and give the hon. Gentleman the assurances that he seeks. I have a further question, which relates to entitlement on premature retirement and benefits under NHS pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff who are members of NHS superannuation schemes have access to early payment of enhanced benefits if they are retired on grounds of ill-health, redundancy or other organisational changes. Although we believe the scheme will still be available to staff who move into the trusts, when the trusts look at the benefits for retirement and premature payments they may not think that they are in their best interests. They may not wish to give those enhanced benefits and instead choose to undermine the comprehensive nature of the NHS superannuation scheme. Will the Minister give an assurance that the enhanced benefits for early retirement on health grounds, and so on, will always continue for staff in the NHS trusts and if they move out to DHA-managed hospitals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the anxieties expressed by Opposition Members about present shortages of a large number of professions allied to medicine which, in some places, are in danger of undermining the provision of full and sufficient standard of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case of speech therapists is a remarkable example of the rigidities of the Whitley system. They refused to join the Whitley council, to which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
Department was anxious for them to belong, on the sound ground that most other professions in the Whitley council at that time were not graduate entry professions. With hindsight. I think that most speech therapists will now say that that was an error of judgment. However, it demonstrates that the Whitley council system is not flexible enough to enable professions with their different attitudes and ways of working to be properly looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great possibilities that the Bill will open up is that a number of professions allied to medicine, far from having to be employees directly of NHS trusts or DHAs, will be able to set themselves up as freestanding consortia within the NHS while acting as contractors in their own right to establish the freedom of action and remuneration that will enable them to recruit and retain the staff that they badly need. Those opportunities need to be explored with imagination and drive. I do not share the tremendous anxieties that the NHS trusts, for example, will destroy them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister comment about the serious danger that the Bill will result in the Health Service going back to being exclusively doctor-led? That would be a serious error. Many professions, of which speech therapy is the leader in time, have achieved the necessary position of being able to form their own diagnosis and make their own treatment plans for patients. Indeed, patients are entitled to refer themselves directly to speech therapists without the intermediary of a doctor. That is a valuable way forward. It would be a serious blow to the NHS if we were to start to return to the position in which the medical profession alone had the right to decide who should receive treatment and the grounds on which that treatment should be offered. The new, freer and more direct arrangements envisaged by the Bill can work profitably to the benefit of the professions allied to medicine, and other workers within the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of questions about training and the position of training within hospital trusts. When the Minister replies, will she do so specifically, rather than simply give an expression of hope, or high falutin' words of high principle? We need practical clarity about how the system will work. I say to the Minister, "Don't waffle on this one." Tell us clearly how training will operate within hospital trusts at all levels. It is bound to be tempting for trusts not to undertake training because they will want to cut costs and training costs money. Even a percentage cut in training will be serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many areas we have already found that it is extremely easy to erode the training skill base and difficult to restore the position when that has been lost. Therefore, we are worried that training will disappear, as a reduction in training in hospital trusts will be serious.

My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) raised serious points about speech therapy. It is not good enough for the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) to suggest that arguments over the Whitley council are the basis of the erosion of the speech therapy service. I have dealt with many cases in my constituency where the shortage of speech therapists is to the serious detriment of young children who have the ability to learn and develop if only they can be given help at a crucial time in their development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for the Government to sulk and say that they did not get their way on the Whitley council. The Government have neglected to ensure that the training and development of the speech therapy services carries on. We are now at the difficult stage where it will take years, not months or weeks, to restore that service. The Minister must not simply say, "It will be all right. The hospital trusts will do some training." The Minister must tell us how the Government will ensure that hospital trusts will adequately train all levels of staff, in all specialities and thus play a full part in the Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The National Audit Office has made it clear that the private health sector does not train, which places greater pressure on the NHS. People are poached from the NHS after being trained by it. There could be a narrowing of the training base if NHS trusts do not play a full part in basic and progressive training at every level of all the health professions. It is not enough for the Minister to say that it will not happen. If our fears turn out to be justified, it will be too late.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the contentions cannot both be right. I contend that hospital staff can look forward to every improvement in working conditions once the Bill beomes law.

The hon. Member for Workington ought to be aware that we are all creatures of our backgrounds, with our own prejudices. We should, therefore, treat one another as hon. Members. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who is also a personal friend, has been criticised for the success of his business career. I know that the hon. Gentleman's business career flopped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I warn the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, as I warn all hon. Member's of the Committee, that I shall not tolerate such deviation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Dame Janet. But I am confident that Conservative Members can argue on the merits of the Bill. We do not feel the need to bring personalities into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is what I am inviting the hon. Gentleman to refrain from doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly, Dame Janet. However, I think that it is only fair that when the hon. Member for Workington attacks my hon Friend's—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. That is a matter for the Chairman to deal with. It is open to a Chairman to take a short break and to invite a Committee member to take his or her place. I might just do that.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have made my point, Dame Janet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottom-ley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the provision for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
transfer of staff from health authorities to NHS trust employment. We have had a lengthy debate, and I was impressed by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). I was also impressed by those hon. Members who spoke about the advantages of establishing NHS trusts and the benefits for those who will be employed by them. The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) spoke about the provisions with much mistrust, suspicion and misunderstanding. Schemes will be set up and will have to be approved by my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State. He fully intends that NHS trusts should act as good employers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but I feel that some members of the Committee are finding it difficult to hear. I invite the Minister to speak a little more loudly. This is not an easy Room in which to speak and be heard; it might be the fan that is causing the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak with greater volume, Dame Janet. That is not something that I am normally accused of failing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with new territory. On occasion, people in the public sector have changed the institution for which they worked. Last year, for instance, 30 grant-maintained schools and 83 polytechnics and colleges moved into a new, more free-standing organisation. We want NHS trusts—local organisations—to be able to develop the corporate ethos and sense of enthusiasm and flexibility that is so clearly an adavantage in acquiring the best contribution from all those who work for them. I was surprised to hear the reservations of the hon. Member for Livingston about the Japanese model of employment, because it produces a sense of corporate loyalty and commitment, which is precisely what we want to achieve. We also want flexible employment patterns to ensure that we get the best out of those who work for the local institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be uncertainty during the transition, but staff will not lose out by being transferred to NHS trust employment. They will keep their existing terms and conditions of service. We intend that transfers should conform with good employment practices. I made it clear that the employing health authorities will be expected to undertake proper consultation with staff representatives, and in good time before the operative date, on matters relating to staff transfers. My right honourable and learned Friend The Secretary of State will wish to satisfy himself that such consultation has taken place before approving transfers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that staff will keep their existing employment rights. Will she confirm that they will still have the guaranteed right to belong to a union, that their union will be recognised, and that it will be able to bargain collectively on their behalf;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: NHS trusts will be free to conduct their own industrial relations and to determine the machinery for doing so. That includes resolving
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
questions relating to the recognition of staff organisations and trades unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of NHS trusts to change terms and conditions of service, including staff pay, will be an important part of their greater freedom. The new freedoms will enable them to respond flexibly to local recruitment and retention difficulties. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) referred to the areas in which that freedom is important. We want NHS trusts to provide the employment packages that are necessary to attract high-quality staff, who are a pre-requisite of the high-quality service that will help to win contracts and, above all, benefit patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) spoke of several groups, including biochemists, physicists, speech therapists and occupational therapists. Speech therapists have been supported by many hon. Members. By promoting greater flexibility, we shall encourage more people to train in speech therapy and go to the areas where the need is greatest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The working paper on NHS trusts provides for the accounting officer of the Department of Health to exercise financial management scrutiny of the trusts. Will he be responsible for ensuring that the attitude of the trusts towards staff will constitute long-term value for money, which can be obtained only by ensuring the integrity of the professions to which I referred;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to be satisfied that the trusts will look go the long-term interests of all staff. We are convinced that high-quality, well-remunerated staff will ensure good patient care. It will be especially important for NHS trusts to offer high-quality care. They will depend for their resources on the contracts that they secure from the DHAs and general practices and they will want to be satisfied that those to whom they entrust their patients are qualified to undertake care at the level that they request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked an important question about the role and responsibilities of the accounting officer. Will officers have the responsibilities set out by my hon. Friend? I think that the Minister knows the answer without the need for consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that the accounting officer will have just those responsibilities. I hope that that assures the hon. Gentleman. He should heed the message of my general remarks that we are confident that the NHS trusts will appoint well-skilled professionals to carry out high quality work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And sunshine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And sunshine if that were possible. The reinforcement of excellence is the aim of our proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm the distinction between rights transferred intact to employees within NHS trusts and conditions that may be changed or improved later by negotiation;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a good point. Staff will transfer under the terms of their existing contracts; NHS trusts can then discuss contractual amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not yet grasped the point made by the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) that existing terms and conditions will be transferred and that changes will be matters for future negotiation. I accept the hon. Gentleman's way of expressing that. The Minister is not facing up to requests from staff who expect that terms and conditions are likely to be changed, and who wish to preserve their existing negotiating rights so that changes are subject to the collective bargaining process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman). If the Minister is not prepared to protect, and if she is saying that the Secretary of State will not include, existing union recognition, rights of negotiation on terms and conditions, and rights of collective bargaining, then her hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle, has raised an alarming point because terms and conditions will be able to be changed without negotiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Transferred staff will retain their existing contracts, subject to the technical changes necessary for transfers. Self-governing NHS trusts may seek to change existing contracts after transfer, but they have to do so by agreement in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the Whitley system—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, trusts can tear up contracts once staff have transferred because there is no one to re-negotiate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made it clear that transfers will occur using existing contracts. The proposals purpose is to ensure that some flexibility is included in the employment patterns of NHS trusts. The Bill does not eleminate central bargaining, nor does it destroy the Whitley system. Whitley agreements are increasingly freeing local management to make flexible arrangements to meet local requirements. The Bill allows trusts managements to recognise Whitley agreements if they wish, or to introduce appropriate local alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the staff covered by review bodies. Individual trusts will determine pay and conditions for all staff, including those who are covered by review bodies, but existing contracts will be protected at the point of transfer. It will be up to the trusts to offer and agree any subsequent changes to individuals' pay and conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) spoke at length about her DHA. Competitive tendering has saved the NHS £100 million. It ensures that quality is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
maintained because specifications are monitored and if there are any difficulties the contract can be renegotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff transfer schemes will be subject to central review and approval. That will ensure that existing terms and conditions are protected. We are not talking about redundancy and the re-employment of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed at the extent to which Opposition Members spread alarm stories about the proposals instead of considering the reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends raised several specific issues—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Department endorse the views expressed by Mr. Edwards in the Trent document? What is its status;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to reserve a special place for the remarks of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) at the end of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Trent document is an internal working paper. It has no formal status in the Department. I shall describe later how its ethos and philosophy tie in with our thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), the hon. Member's for Manchester, Withing-ton (Mr. Bradley) and Livingston spoke about superannuation arrangements. The employees 6f NHS trusts will be free to remain in the NHS superannuation scheme or to join an alternative scheme offered by a trust. The trusts will contribute to the NHS superannuation scheme in the same way as health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington asked about premature retirement. Those who opt to stay within the scheme will remain eligible for all benefits, including premature retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst mentioned the NHS injury scheme regulations. I give him a categorical guarantee that the regulations will be amended to allow NHS trust staff to receive benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) cited the case of a constituent who did not receive maternity pay. That is primarily the responsibility of Ministers in the Department of Social Security. I assure my hon. Friend that rights to maternity pay under the existing NHS terms will be protected on transfer to an NHS trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) raised the issue of equal opportunities legislation. Legislation and guidance on health and safety, ethical matters and good practice, and especially equal opportunities, will apply to NHS trusts. I share the hon. Gentleman's view of the importance of equal opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying, in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), that those employed in NHS trusts will have the same legal rights in respect of equal opportunities and health and safety as others? The
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
NHS has improved on equal opportunities legislation. Will those improvements be sustained or will those working for NHS trusts merely retain their legal rights and no more;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The legal requirements will remain applicable to those who move to NHS trusts. NHS trusts will be obliged to follow guidance that applies to the NHS, including that on equal opportunities. I share the belief of the hon. Member for Pontypridd that employees of NHS trusts should be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) stressed the importance of training. It is a vital part of the NHS, and trusts will have a duty to provide training, especially for nursing and allied professions. It will be in the trusts' interests to provide training and to develop as centres of excellence giving high-quality care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will the Minister ensure that they provide training;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. Training will be funded separately by the RHA contracts. There will be no cost disincentive to training. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the unlikely event of a trust failing in its duties, schedule 2 gives the Secretary of State power to direct that standards are maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has a profound distrust of the ethos and philosophy of trusts. Government investment in the Health Service has risen dramatically over the past 10 years. However, the resources could be deployed more efficiently and effectively. People in the Health Service want the freedom and flexibility to recruit staff according to local requirements and to retain them. They want to be able to draw up contracts to ensure that they get the best out of people, for the benefit of patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington has a suspicion of the private scetor. He should not spend all his time working on behalf of his sponsoring union: he should join me in a visit to Marks and Spencer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, I was considering how nurses in the Health Service are deployed, and how they are valued and the work that they do. I was in Marks and Spencer and I decided to cross-question the lady who served me about her conditions of employment. She described an employment package that met her needs to flexible working and supported her. She thus felt valued and was able to give a high-quality service. She described nothing that made me distrust private sector models.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Health Service we want flexible employment patterns that meet people's needs and dnable them to make an effective contribution. Employees want a comprehensive business plan that ensures the long term future of their organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should not be fooled by what I say about private enterprise. I am probably seen as a Right winger in the Labour party
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
because of my great sympathy with enterprise and business, but I know exactly where to draw the distinction. My colleagues and I see the NHS in terms of a public service, and we foresee that it will become a privately funded service in which profit considerations determine the level of service availability. That is our fear, and that is why the Bill makes some of us so angry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely using a small anecdote to demonstrate that the business sector can teach us something about personnel and management skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that the NHS is not for sale. There is no question of privatisation. It will continue to be available to all, regardless of income, and it will be financed mainly out of taxation. I want to make that clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Minister leaves terms and conditions, will she confirm that NHS trusts will continue with existing NHS conditions? Although the trusts would not be bound by any future changes in NHS conditions, it would clearly be in their interest to try to match them if they wanted to retain their staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point. The NHS trusts will seek to employ staff who wish, to work there, who benefit from working there, and who feel that their contributions are valued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendments. We intend to set up schemes, approved by the Secretary of State, for the transfer of staff that a successful NHS trust will need to ensure that the people who work for it are fully involved and consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her anecdote about Marks and Spencer, the Minister may have been giving us a clue that Lord Sieff is to take the chair of all the boards of directors of NHS trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Goverment have gone ahead with setting up opted-out hospitals, despite the unpopularity of the project. They have objected to the staff having any say in whether the hospital in which they work should opt out. Now, in the Minister's response to the amendments, we discover that the Government are objecting to any guarantee on pay or conditions for staff who, without having any say in the matter, will be moved from the NHS into opted-out hospitals. I repeat that there will be no guarantee on pay and conditions, because whether they move with their existing contracts depends on whether they can enforce their contracts, and the contracts are virtually useless if collective bargaining rights are stripped away. How many county court actions have succeeded in enforcing terms and conditions of individuals workers' contracts of employment? The answer is none. The only remedy will be after the staff are sacked, when they can go to an industrial tribunal, and that is not good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) agreed that it would be open to any
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
union worth its salt to organise its members in the new arrangement under NHS trusts and to seek to achieve terms and conditions which are at least as good for its members as are those applying under the main Health Service;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that on transfer from the NHS hospital to a self-governing trust there is no guarantee of recognition of the protection that the employees' union represents. The only thing that the Minister has told us this morning—apart, that is, from where she does her shopping—is that there will be no guaranteed trade union protection for employees whose employer becomes an opted-out hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Lady is a lawyer. [Hon. Ms.: "She is."] In that case, I am surprised to hear her say that contracts made between an individual and a health trust are not enforceable if they do not have trade union backing. Is that the purport of her remarks? I did not understand her and must seek clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman asks, yes, I am a solicitor and I have experience of employment law. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was right to pick me up on this. Technically, the contract of employment is enforceable but, in practice, the fact that these employees are paid and in employment will make them ineligible for legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore they will not be able to enforce their rights in a county court. The evidence is overwhelming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman simply reveals his ignorance of the way in which these things work in practice—if he believes that a bit of paper without the backing of collective action provides protection for employees. We shall press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Does the hon. Lady wish to give way;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Against my better judgement, I shall give way to the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), Dame Janet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to begin a dangerous precedent where members of the Bar give solicitors free advice, but perhaps I ought to do so. The hon. Lady is talking nonsense. She said that many NHS workers receive very low pay.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thanks to the Government's consistent cuts in the eligibility level for legal aid, even those who have to depend on family credit and housing benefits are often not eligible for legal aid.

	<p>Question accordingly negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Will it be in order to raise a genuine point of order'—a rare event? It has to do with the administration of the Committee, and I have thought about it for some time. This is the third major Bill on whose Committee I have served. Our Public Gallery is always full of people who are interested in our debates but it is difficult to follow them unless they have the agenda and your selection of amendments. The documents are available only from the Table in the centre of the room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On other Standing Committees, I was repeatedly asked by people in the Gallery, "Can you get the documents for me because I cannot follow the procedure?" I know that there is a public cost, and I do not suggest that we make the entire Bill available because that would cost a good deal, but surely it would cost very little to make available the printed selection of amendments and the agenda on a table at the back of the room so that those who sit in the Public Gallery can take them easily without having to beg us for copies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter over which I, as Chairman, have control. These are considered to be internal working papers for the Committee and are not distributed to members of the public. I under

stand the point and have some sympathy with it, but it has to be raised through other channels before it can be decided whether there should be a change in our procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. We have voted on the first of a group of amendments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each document is separate. The issue raised is not something over which I, as Chairman, have control. If the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) wishes to pursue it in other ways and have the rules changed, it is in order for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the point of order of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), and in a spirit of consensus, may I say that I understand that the amendment paper is not an internal document. It is published and available at the Vote Office: it is an HMSO publication which I am sure could be made available. You, Dame Janet, would be in a position to make representations to the chairman of the Services Committee and raise it at the next meeting of the Liaison Committee if the hon. Gentleman were to press his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A distinction must be made. The amendment paper is a public document and is therefore open. I thought that the hon. Gentleman referred to amendment lists, which are not. The matter can be taken further, but not now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. This is purely technical. You will be aware that I have occasionally complained about the accoustics in this Room. May I record for the attention of the Palace staff that what I thought earlier today was an external storm which made white horses and other embellishments on the Thames was an extremely noisy fan which made hearing, which was already difficult, virtually impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point has been made. We must move on to the next amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment proposed: No. 450, in page 7, line 26, leave out subsection (5) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) Subsections (3) and (4) above are without prejudice to any employee's right to remain an employee of the health authority after the operational date—[Mr. Robin Cook]".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Question put, That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes 13, Noes 16:</p>
