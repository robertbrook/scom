<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 758, in page 39, line 16, leave out subsections (4) and (5).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 728, in page 39, line 20, after "being", insert—

<p>No. 729, in page 39, line 27, after "being", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"a non-profit making organisation or person".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient for members of the Committee, and relieve their feelings after the awkward period of bi-partisanship before dinner if we descended into a period of grubby party-political divisions. I hope that I shall fulfil that cathartic role in the next 10 minutes.<br><br>
Amendment No. 758 seeks to delete subsections (4) and (5) which extend the thrust of the privatisation arrangements of the clause to non-residential care. So far we have debated only how the use of private agencies and the voluntary sector applies to residential care. These subsections apply to domiciliary care.<br><br>
As someone who once was a councillor on a social services authority, I come to this debate with a strong sense of pride in what I and many other Labour councillors and councils have been able to do for the people whom we represented by providing proper and decent standards of domiciliary care for those in need. Indeed, as a member of the Opposition, I take unashamed delight in the fact that every one of the 20 councils at the top of the league table for the provision of home helps is in majority Labour control. I do not feign any sense of either surprise or regret that my party is so well represented. The Minister for Health must be familiar with those figures, because her consitituency is in the county that, in the whole of England, has the lowest provision of home helps for elderly people. Doubtless the people of Surrey have intimate family ties and extended links of family kinship. Nevertheless, it is difficult to credit that Surrey can get by with half the home help provision of Croydon let alone one fifth that of Wigan.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 832</span>
That brings me, unfortunately to the White Paper on community care to which the Minister was party, possibly informed by her experiences in Surrey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My experience also includes Peckham and Brixton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the White Paper is not adequately informed by the Minister's experiences in Peckham and Brixton. I recognise Surrey in the White Paper, but not Peckham or Brixton. One reason is that one of the most startlingly new and unexpected elements of the White Paper is the proposal to involve the private sector in domiciliary care. The original drafts of the White Paper, which were helpfully provided to the Sunday papers 10 days before publication, suggested stronger language than we found in the printed version. Nevertheless the authorised version is sufficiently alarming. On page 23 it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government expects social services authorities to explore ways of further stimulating private and voluntary provision for domiciliary, day and respite care wherever possible … Social services authorities will be expected to make clear in their community care plans what steps they will be taking to make increased use of nonstatutory service providers, or, where such providers are not currently available, how they propose to stimulate such activity. In particular, they should consider how they will encourage diversification in the non-residential care sector."</p></blockquote>
Where did the idea of privatising non-residential care come from? It did not come from the Griffiths report, on which the White Paper is allegedly based. There is no hint in the Griffiths report of involving the private or the non-profit making voluntary sectors in a wider range of non-residential care. Nor did the idea of such involvement come from the voluntary sector, on which Ministers have relied heavily when interpreting those paragraphs. Statements from the voluntary sector since the publication of the White Paper have expressed pained surprise and anxiety. A briefing from the Spastics Society, for instance, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We cannot and will not be able to take on all those aspects of local authority services relating to people with cerebral palsy. We are deeply concerned about any assumptions that the public provision of care for disabled people can be in the main shifted to the private and not for profit sector without devastating consequences for disabled people."</p></blockquote>
The director of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, speaking on behalf of a wide range of organisations which, apparently, are expected to step in the breach and take over from local authorities, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pluralism in care does not—and cannot—mean wholesale voluntarisation of mainstream services".</p></blockquote>
The director further stressed the need to safeguard the unique, valuable role of the voluntary sector in providing,
<br><blockquote><p>"advocacy, self-help, community development and innovation",</p></blockquote>
all of which are inevitably in conflict with substituting for local authorities in mainstream social service provision.<br><br>
The idea of privatising non-residential care did not spring from public demand, either. I am aware from earlier debates that Conservative Members do not care to be reminded of public opinion about these issues. However, a poll carried out by, I think. <i>Care</i> revealed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0801">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
that 83 per cent were opposed to the privatisation of the social service functions of local authorities.<br><br>
The proposal for stimulating the private, not-for-profit voluntary sector certainly did not come from the local authorities. The obligations imposed on them by the Government have given them wide experience of working with private contractors, and the idea of handing domiciliary care to private contractors has left local authorities in a state of cataleptic paralysis. On clear, consistent, fact which has emerged from that experience is that private contractors mean high staff turnover. Some private contractors have gone through all of their staff in one year—some have gone through even more. The prize is held by a contractor who, in one year, went through his entire staff four times over. Such rapid staff turnover is not adventitious but is an inevitable result of the staff conditions that private contractors rely on. Not only do they rely on casual, part-time staff; they seek them out, so that they can avoid paying national insurance contributions. They do not offer their staff accrued holiday pay, private superannuation deals, or any other conditions or terms that would encourage staff to stay for more than the minimum period. They do not have intensive training because, as they expect high staff turnover, it would be a lost investment. The application of that labour culture to domiciliary care alarms me. One reason why home helps are valued by the people whom they serve is their familiarity. People want home helps whom they know and equally they want home helps who know them and who understand their background, emotional difficulties and family circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) anticipates my argument. People need home helps whom they can trust. We are talking about helpers who enter their homes on a regular basis. They can see any valuables, or any antiques that there may be in that home. They have the keys to homes. Frequently, they are asked to collect pensions from post offices, against the explicit instructions of local authorities. Flexibility is important as a home help's work may vary from day to day and client to client. I have seen specifications given to private contractors by local and health authorities where every minute is measured and every task is billed and pinned down. An intimate personal social service such as the home help service cannot be reduced to narrow and detailed specifications, just as family obligations cannot be reduced to work studies.<br><br>
Another reason why the private contractural approach does not fit the home help service is that all experience of domiciliary care shows that it works best when it is managed on a small scale, according to the needs of individual clients and in consultation with the local social services team. There is no evidence that the private sector is interested in that intensive small-scale management. Therefore, the Government would find it easier to privatise nuclear power generation than the home help service.<br><br>
I shall put a particular worry to the Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not to me.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I shall ask the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. It is fortunate that he is to respond, as he responded to the debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) this morning. The Under-Secretary will recall that we spent nearly all morning debating residential care inspection arrangements and ways of ensuring that those arrangements were distanced from the provider. I think that I can say without risking the partisan spirit in which I tabled the amendment, that both Conservative and Opposition Members shared anxieties about arrangements. The appalling factor is that there are no arrangements for statutory inspection of private sector domiciliary care. It is not a matter of arm's-length arrangements or otherwise; arrangements do not exist.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) said that inspection arrangements were important not only as a sanction but as a vehicle for the transmission of better practice, with which I am in considerable agreement. There is no such vehicle for domiciliary care; inspection arrangements are not proposed in the Bill. If the Government persist in retaining subsections (4) and (5), I beg them to consider the importance of accepting amendment No. 550, because it would be outrageous if they were to create provisions for a new private domiciliary care market without any inspection arrangements to police homes and enforce adequate standards.<br><br>
9 pm<br><br>
I would much prefer it if the Minister made my amendment redundant by dropping subsections (4) and (5). If he does not, at least he should explain why the proposals are in the Bill, and from what popular demand or special lobbying they arose. Apart from ideological prejudice and opposition to local authority provision, there is no justification for the proposals. I hope that hon. Gentlemen will consider them with an open mind. If they cannot be justified, they should ask why a major change is being proposed without any previous public or special debate on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to take up a point made by my hon. Friend. I pay tribute to the home help service, which will be directly affected by the clause. Before I entered Parliament, I had the honour to work alongside vast numbers of the undervalued, underpaid men and women of the home help service. The money spent on them was probably the best money spent by the social services. They provide a first-class service.<br><br>
The Minister of State said earlier that the Bill planned for the future. She will probably have a greater understanding of my argument, because of her background in social work, than other Ministers. I am sorry that she will not reply to the debate, but I mean no disrespect to the Under-Secretary of State for Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know from my social work background that public is not always best. We want quality, which can be provided by public and private care. I do not accept the partisan contributions from Labour Members who believe that only the public sector is trustworthy.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 835</span>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister intervened before she had heard my argument.<br><br>
Privatisation of care services is inappropriate, as some residential care over the past 10 years shows. Care provided by a private market is not necessarily in the best interests of the client, the elderly person. The market motivation is primarily to make money. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is difficult to speak against the backgrround of noise, but I shall do my best.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is far too much noise in the Committee, not all of it on one side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will not apportion the blame. Both sides are equally culpable from time to time. I want to hear the hon. Member in relative peace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Dame Janet. I am against privatisation and the market model of welfare provision because it is important to develop alternatives to institutional care. The market model will not do that. The evidence is the Government's record after 10 years in office, as we discussed earlier.<br><br>
I question the Government's definition of community care. Figures for Government expenditure on community care are bandied about, but they do not relate to genuine community care. There is a big difference, as I hope the Minister for Health will agree, between institutional care and genuine care in the community. I hope that genuine community care will develop so that people are not put into institutions. That has not happened under this Government.<br><br>
Some Ministers and Conservative Ministers believe that community care means transferring people from public Victorian mental institutions into private Victorian mental institutions. That is not community care; it is institutional care. Vast numbers of people are shunted away from areas where they have lived all their lives and into private homes. The Government deem the expenditure on those placements as being on community care. I question their definition. It is not community care but something completely different. That is why I attack the Government.</span></p>
<p>9.5 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>9.20 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchcliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I was rudely interrupted by the Division Bell, I was saying that when we use the market as a means of providing welfare services, we should remember that the market provides the services that are in the interests of the market and not necessarily in the interests of the client.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of market operations. The market does not operate in favour of the business man; the market is simply the choices of people—a few people, scores of people,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 836</span>
hundreds, thousands or millions of people—vis-a-vis those who provide the services. Unless the hon. Gentleman understands that, he will never understand this debate or any other debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchcliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the Committee because I have some understanding of community care, and in my view the market model is not relevant to that. I can give an example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gives that example, may I just say a word about the welfare of old people? Has the hon. Gentleman noticed that the Bill says that the extension should be from any voluntary organisation to any other person
<br><blockquote><p>"being an organisation or person appearing to the authority to be capable of promoting the welfare of old people?"</p></blockquote>
If those are the words in the Bill, surely whether it is secured for gain or whether it is secured from the voluntary sector or by direct provision is irrelevant. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that that provision is entirely in the interests of the welfare of old people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy to trust Wakefield district council, which is Labour-controlled, with that subsection, but I would not trust Kent county council or a number of other authorities that I could mention, some of which are probably worse than Kent, because they would deliver it directly into the hands of the private sector.<br><br>
I come back to the intervention of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). I am worried about a business model for the provision of welfare because I do not believe that it delivers what is necessarily wanted by the person needing care. The example that is before our eyes and was mentioned by many hon. Members, including the only Conservative Member who was sincere enough to abstain in the last Division—the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe)—shows that it is not in the interests of the people involved.<br><br>
We have had a massive free market experiment in the provision of care, with the open-ended public subsidy of income support, and it has led to a huge explosion in one form of provision—institutional provision. In 1979, when the Government came to office, there were 35,000 places in private homes; now there are 200,000. I accept that there has been a major change in the numbers of elderly people, but that does not justify the huge explosion in institutional places. The Government have created an expectation that if granny needs care, she has to go into a home. The response to the need of an elderly or disabled person has been in terms of institutional provision. That is what the market has deemed appropriate, and in my view it is wholly wrong. We have evidence from the Audit Commission and various universities, including York, to show that vast numbers of elderly people now in institutional care, with income support from the state, could have been cared for in community. They do not need to be in institutional care. The market model has created an explosion in one form of care, because a profit can be made from the purchase of an old mansion which is then sold off and opened by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0803">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 837</span>
private sector. That model is, in many instances, inappropriate. In creating an explosion in institutional care, the Government have created the idea that the only option for an elderly person is to go into care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share some of the hon. Gentleman's reservations about the burgeoning of residential care, as opposed to community care. The great advantage of the Bill, which is what we are supposed to be discussing, is that it establishes an assessment of need, and the intention—certainly, my hope—is that there will be a considerable development of genuine community care. The hon. Gentleman is describing—in exaggerated terms—an existing situation which has little to do with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the issue of assessment. I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but if a social worker is asked to assess a client's needs, that assessment can be based only on the available provision. My argument against the Government's model of business welfare is that it is biased entirely in one direction, that of institutional care. They have chopped, cut and hammered genuine community care. They have rate-capped some excellent authorities that have developed some innovative forms of domiciliary care, and hammered them for doing that. I shall give examples in a moment.<br><br>
I believe in assessment. It is crucial, but it is impossible to make a recommendation on an assessment for a service that does not exist, and even with assessment, there is an inbuilt bias, through market forces, in one direction. My argument against the privatisation of domiciliary care is that the business sector will not provide what is genuinely needed; it will provide what it can make money out of.<br><br>
I want to say a word about the need to develop new alternatives and to innovate. I do not believe that the market will be interested in alternatives to institutional care. Let us consider for a moment the increased range of housing provision that is needed. I realise that the matter is not strictly in order, Dame Janet, but may I briefly point to the need not just for sheltered accommodation but for very sheltered accommodation, where elderly or disabled people can live in their their own homes and at the same time have communal contact, 24-hour supervision, if that is necessary, and not be shunted into an institution. They can have their privacy, with their own bathroom and toilet. They have a right to their own home, even when many people think that they should be in some for of institutional care, It happened to my mother, I have talked to my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) about her, but although many people thought that she should be in institutional care, she was kept in her own home, in a sheltered housing unit, with support. That is the kind of model that is needed, but the private sector will not develop it because it cannot make money out of it. That is what motivates the private sector.<br><br>
The subsection relates to domicilialry support. Last week or the week before, I drew the Minister for Health's attention to a model in Sheffield. Sheffield city council, which is labour-controlled and which has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 838</span>
been hammered by the Government as an overspending extravagant authority, has developed some excellent modes of non-institutional care, designed to keep people in their own homes in the community. But the council has been hammered for that, I suggested that the Minister for Health should have a look at the elderly persons' support unit, which was built six or seven years ago. The council had capital funding for part III accommodation, but it decided instead to consider a different model, based on keeping people out of homes. The unit supports in the community people who, in most other areas, would have been in institutional care years ago. Those people are in their own homes and receive intensive support from a first-class, Labour-controlled council.<br><br>
9.30 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) opened a unit in his constituency this week. The unit is based on the same model as that in Sheffield. Manchester has been hammered for being an extravagant council, but it is a caring council developing alternatives so as to keep people in their own homes. The private sector is not interested in such models because the money is not there. That is why I am anxious about handing the provisions to the private sector. It is not in the interests of people in the community.<br><br>
Increased support for carers was mentioned. That is a public sector service. The private sector has not been involved in respite fostering and so on. Innovation and new models are needed for that kind of care. The private sector will not do it.<br><br>
There are numerous alternatives to institutional care. The Governments record is shameful: they have driven into institutions people who could and should remain in the community. I am excited by the prospect of a change of Goverment; without massive increase in resources we can utilise existing resources to keep people out of care, not force them into it.<br><br>
The provision of care cannot be left to the market because it will not deliver what is needed to keep people in the community. It will deliver more institutional care because that is the easiest way for big companies to make money. Laissez-faire market forces have no role in this respect. They will merely condemn people to the dustbin of institutions, and my party does not want care based on that model.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said that he would open up some grubby party divisions. They were predictable divisions: the word "private" makes the Labour party salivate. That is what it is about. The Bill is permissive. The Opposition seek to restrict it. They want to remove the opportunity for local authorities to find the best value for money and the best treatment for their clients in the private voluntary or public sectors.<br><br>
It was extraordinary that the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hichliffe) went on about the community, because the purpose of the Bill is that as many people as possible should be treated in their own homes. A perverse result of the present system is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0804">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 839</span>
people who should have been left at home have been put into residential accommodation. That is a fuelling point of the Bill.<br><br>
There is not a great deal more to be said on the issue. There is an extraordinary belief in the Labour party that we intend to turn everything over to the private sector. Far from it. However, I remind hon. Gentlemen, expecially the hon. Member for Livingston, that the Griffiths report states.
<br><blockquote><p>"The contribution of the private sector is mainly in the field of residential care, but there has also been growth of private sheltered housing provision and, on a relatively small scale, organised domiciliary care services. The best examples show how services can respond very flexibly to meet the particular needs of individuals in a way that is acceptable to them and takes full account of their personal circumstances. It is important that changes in the present systems for using public funds to support community care do not strengthen the potential monopoly power of the public sector and so restrict this contribution."</p></blockquote>
That is what the Labour party seeks to do. We believe in the freedom of the market and freedom of choice for those who provide care and those who need it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have learned no lessons about the free market ideology. It has cost the country more than £1 billion each year in payments to the private sector. The Government have got into a jam and are trying to get out of it by foisting the Florence Smith gap on to the elderly and their relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) contends that it costs the Government £1 billion each year in payments for private residential care for elderly people. What would it cost the public sector if the people who are presently in private care—I believe that they number about 250,000—were in part III accommodation run by local authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must have been asleep in the past few hours. The point has been made time and again that such people have entered institutional care because the Government have encouraged private care through social security payments. They have opted for institutions without assessment of their need to be in them and it would have been much cheaper if that care had been made available in the community through a range of packages.<br><br>
The Government have not learnt any lessons. The home help service provides real value for money. Some years ago, an experiment was conducted in Ireland but it was torn to shreds. The Government set up a working party to investigate the cost of the home help service but the report disappeared because they could not get its conclusions to stick. It was a sham. The Government persuaded a good university to look into the matter but they tore its findings apart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should understand that we are not arguing about that matter. We accept that home helps do a magnificent job, and that is why their numbers in Wales have been increased by 42 per cent by the Government. All we are asking is that if care which people want can be provided privately at good value for money, why should they not be allowed to have it?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 840</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to kid the Committee. Let us deal with the increase in the numbers of home helps. The number of elderly people has doubled since 1975.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend allow me to support her argument? The Minister says that if people can afford the care which they want, why should they not have it? I shall explain why I do not believe that it is appropriate to have an open market in the provision of care. People do not necessarily believe that that is what is needed.<br><br>
When I was a young social worker, I went to see a chap of about 68 or 69 whose wife had died. He had been referred to my department because he wanted to go into a home. He did not need to do so but he had the money to pay to enter one. I dissuaded him by explaining that there were options other than going into a home because by doing so he would have gone down the Swanee and been finished by becoming institutionalised in a matter of a few months. He did not need to enter a home because there were other options, but that is the muddle created by the private sector. The Minister works on that muddle by saying, "If they can pay for it, let them have it," but it might not be what elderly people need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.<br><br>
I shall move on to other points that I wish to make. I repeat that what staggers me about the Government's proposals for that service is that it provides real value for money. Its domiciliary workers and homehelps are very dedicated and paid very low wages. I wish that we could do something about raising their wages because all they have at present is job security. If that security goes through the provision of packages of private care, the results will be the same as happened to laundry and domestic workers in the Health Services.<br><br>
The story about the Halifax laundry should be compulsory bedtime reading for every Tory Minister because it will be a great waste of taxpayers' money to go down that road, but it looks at though we shall.<br><br>
I wish to refer to one or two matters mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe). There have been many innovations in the care of elderly people. The decentralisation in Sheffield that my hon. Friend spoke about has occurred in Wakefield to some extent. What we are trying to do in Calderdale will be cheaper to the Exchequer in the long run than giving huge handouts to the private sector. Most importantly, it is better for the elderly person receiving the service. I do not want to be in a position in a year or two to say, "I told you so" to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Careful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government will not be in power then. My hon. Friends on the Front Bench will be struggling with some of these disastrous mistakes. It is ludicrous to talk about choice between the private sector and the NHS to an elderly person who sits waiting for a couple of hours a week for the home help to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0805">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 841</span>
come. Old people will not want that choice. Most of them get an excellent service now and it is just mad ideology that has made the Government include these two clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall intervene only for a few moments because I have had my nine o'clock glass of wine which does not help me to speak at length. The Minister took credit for the 42 per cent increase in home helps in Wales just as English Ministers take credit for the increase in home helps in the rest of the United Kingdom. They forget that invariably those increases have taken place within Labour local authorities and invariably they have been involved in scraps with Ministers for money. Those authorities have ended up being attacked on the Floor of the House for being overspenders. It is remarkable that a Minister can claim the credit for what in an another context he would regard as overspending by Labour local authorities.<br><br>
Secondly, I should like to mention the motivation behind privatisation of these services. This is what I refer to outside the House as the Forsyth factor. It is based on the principle that if a privateer can do the job cheaper, let him do it irrespective of the consequences for the quality of the service being provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not provoke the hon. Gentleman unduly, but has he noticed that the Bill specifically refers to "any organisation or person" having regard to the welfare of old people.? It has nothing to do with whether some individual may have fallen down. It is defined as an objective which they should have in view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that Mr. Rachman was conscious of his responsibilities towards tenants, but how effective was he in exercising those responsibilities? Perhaps there would be varying views on that from the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman a very simple question. Who ran the Nye Bevan home? Was it a local authority or a private company?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was administered by a Labour-controlled authority and what happened was wrong. We all know it and we all condemn it. Does that answer the hon. Gentleman's question? Had he not been out of the Committee Room and had he attended our proceedings, he would have heard our debate on these matters this morning. On the Forsyth factor or cheap labour for poor service, it seems that in the case of home helps we should examine—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues, may I point out that there is now a constant buzz of conversation which makes it difficult for me to hear. I ask Committee members to desist, or, if they prefer, to leave the Room and they can then talk to their hearts' content.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be. Dame Janet, that I am exceptionally boring—[<i>Interruption.</i>] But the Committee will have to put up with it. I return to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
Forsyth factor and how it will influence care by home helps. Home helps are low paid. They are hired by local authorities which do not make a profit out of them. My discussions with social workers suggest that the home help service is one of the most efficient areas of local authority activity. Where is the potential for profit? Or should we assume that companies with altruistic motives will be set up and avoid making profits? There are two ways in which a company could make a profit in comparison with the current provision of home help. It could cut services or cut wages. There is nothing else left in the bucket.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
We have seen that in other parts of NHS privatisation. Cutting wages leads to a cut in the quality of service. The quality of labour that would be attracted by a wage even lower than that now paid would reflect what was paid. Alternatively, a company could cut the hours of service provided and charge more for it. If hours were cut, people would not get the cover that they want—and that is happening in Kent. The hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) will remember that he and I discussed that on a TVS programme. I told him that I had a pile of letters about rising home help charges from all over Kent, including the constituency of the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Widdecome</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he had letters from my constituents, who are adequately represented. I asked the hon. Gentleman that he should have the courtesy to inform me of complaints from my constituents when he was engaged in one of his campaigns miles away from his own patch. He said that he would, but his is the first that I have heard of this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We wrote back—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who is "we"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My staff in my office and I wrote back advising people to go to their own Members of Parliament. I did not want to become a conduit for hon. Members in Kent who have clearly failed to carry out their public duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman denying—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Watch it or I shall come to your patch as well!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —denying that his brief is to stir up trouble for Tory MPs? If he denies that, what on earth was he doing there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The truth is that the voice of Labour needs to be heard in Kent, and is, because my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has a special affinity for Kent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps someone could tell me how all that relates to the amendment under consideration?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0806">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The connection may well be in the glass of wine, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These Committee sittings are very valuable because one can sometimes discover whether the hon. Gentleman has been near one's constituency— he does not observe the proprieties by telling me when he is coming. Not one of the constituents on whose letters he is so dependent has taken up the matter with me. I wonder whether he is a con artist rather than a conduit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore that, Dame Janet, because I have broad shoulders. I can only suggest that there may be a reason why those constituents do not contact the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
I do not believe that the potential for profit exists without cutting services and wages or increasing the price to the client. If those are the options, the proposals are fundamentally wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should begin with a public service announcement that I am due to address the Kent county Labour party on Wednesday, 21 February. I do not know where exactly, but I presume it will be in Kent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. It may be difficult for the hon. Gentleman to find the Kent Labour party because it has so few supporters in Kent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even at this late hour, I am sure that the hon. Member realises that that is not a point of order for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. Dame Janet. I shall carry that message of sympathy to the Kent Labour party.<br><br>
I wish to pick up the Minister's remarkable statement that this is a permissive piece of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to do that, but I forgot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend would stick to Perrier water in future, he may remember it next time.<br><br>
The Bill is riddled with central powers of direction. Under clause 44, powers are given to the Secretary of State in the following sweeping terms:
<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to section 7 of this Act, every local authority shall exercise their social services functions in accordance with such directions as may be given to them under this section by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Some of those functions are given under subsections (4) and (5) of clause 37. The Minister cannot ask to swallow the idea that subsections (4) and (5) are permissive in the context of clause 44, but I am happy to negotiate a compromise with him. My hon. Friends and I tabled an amendment to delete that part of clause 44. I cannot recall the number of the amendment, but no doubt the unflappable Mr. Jack, our Clerk, will draw the Minister's attention to it. If the Minister agrees to delete those four lines from clause 44, I shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 844</span>
take his word that subsections (4) and (5) are permissive. From the Minister's reticence, I take it that he is not tempted by may offer. As long as clause 44 remains unchanged, it is risible to suggest that the proposals are permissive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have a deal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have heard me tell Opposition Members that clause 44 contained the final power that could be used by the Secretary of State against the most wayward and disreputable local authority that might break loose. Therefore, I am hardly likely to want to withdraw it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No reasonable Member of Parliament would object to the Secretary of State having powers of default when a local authority behaved unreasonably or failed to discharge its functions under statute. But clause 44 allows the Secretary of State to meddle in any local authority, whether or not it is in default of its functions or acting unreasonably. The Secretary of State is given the power to give expression to his own ideological or political priorities. Such powers should not been entrusted to any Government in a democratic society which is supposedly bound by convention, the scrutiny and the checks and balances of the parliamentary process. It would be unwise for the Committee to trust the Ministers assurance that these subsections are permissive. They are backed up by mandatory powers of direction adopted by the Secretary of State. In the circumstances, I can only advise my hon. Friends that we do our best to remove the subsections from the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 766, in page 39, line 21, after "authority", insert,

<br><blockquote><p>"(6) it shall be the duty of each local authority to prepare annually and publish free of charge a report on its fulfilment of its duties under this part, and to seek the views of the corresponding health authorities, family health service authorities and community health councils on this report, which shall be considered by the local authority in question.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee, but I shall begin by apologising for my absence from this morning's sitting, when the Committee discussed amendments tabled in my name. In common with the constituencies of some other hon. Members in the Committee, my area in the Highlands of Scotland has been knee-deep in flood water. I have spent the last 36 hours up there, with the result that my ability to attend here was curtailed.<br><br>
Secondly, those hon. Members, especially on the Government Benches, who enjoyed the speech by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) might be interested to know that his activity is not limited to investigating the plight of home helps in Maidstone or in other parts of the deep south. Not long ago, the hon. Gentleman popped up in the Highlands of Scotland to speak in support of the Dounreay fast breeder nuclear reactor. He is a man of many parts, and I pay tribute to the scale of his activity. It is interesting that the Highlands of Scotland, like Kent, boast a complete absence of Labour Members of Parliament. Clearly, a visit from the hon. Gentleman is greatly welcomed.<br><br>
The three amendments are straightforward and to the point. I hope that the Minister will reassure me on all three. Amendments No. 766 and 764 seek to include a legislative requirement in clause 37 that local authorities, where they are considering employing voluntary organisations as their agents for the provision of welfare services for either disabled persons or for old people as defined by the Bill, should be obliged to consult the health authorities, the community health councils, the family health service authorities and the voluntary organisations.<br><br>
Amendment No. 763 calls upon the local authority to prepare an annual report, to be published free of charge, in which is set out the duties that the authority has performed. The report will seek the views of the various bodies that I mentioned in the other amendments about the facts and figures that it contains.<br><br>
The amendments are not controversial or disturbing. Local authorities would wish to involve themselves in good practice in an event, so I see no objection to accepting the amendments.<br><br>
Earlier this week I moved a similar amendment. The Secretary of State said that he would not accept it because it would give that level of community representation a veto over the proposals. There is no question of a veto here. The amendment simply asks that these bodies, which have a valuable role to play and a useful insight to give, should be consulted as a matter of good working practice and that the consul-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 846</span>
tation should be underpinned by the publication of an annual report on which those bodies should be statutorily consulted.<br><br>
If the Minister cannot accept the wording of the amendments, I hope that she can give a commitment that she would expect such working practice to be found in local authorities and that she will accept the spirit of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper frequently mentions the importance of consulting and making sure that the public are aware of the processes undertaken by local authorities. If I were to accept the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) local authorities would be in danger of being swamped in a sea of bureaucracy and red tape. We want local authorities to produce a community care plan. We shall discuss those plans under a later clause.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has been absent for so much of our proceedings today, because I mentioned the document that we have issued on inspection units. The social services chief inspector has also sent a letter to directors of social service Department about the ways in which we hope that they will make progress on their plans and implement policy before April 1991. When I circulate to members of the Committee the document on the inspection units, I shall also include that letter to reassure the hon. Gentleman about the context in which the new proposals will be implemented.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendments to include specific authorities because, in a sense, they are incorporated in the overall requirement to produce plans and to consult.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales has already drawn attention to many of the requirements and to the mechanisms for inspection and the placing of contracts. Opposition Members show their naivety in not appreciating that establishing a contract entails giving a clear specification with monitoring, evaluation and a mechanism to deal with any default. That is the advantage of contracting for services. Often it leaves the local authority with more flexibility than when it uses its own provisions.<br><br>
The White Paper makes it clear that the Government want a mixed economy of care. We want good value, high quality services and good planning. We want others to be involved in care in the community.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendment, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that its spirit is integral to the Government's views on community care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that response. Her comments seemed to have nothing to do with the fact that she would not accep the amendment. Her argument did not match her decision.<br><br>
The Minister seemed to be arguing that the spirit of the amendments is what the Government would regard as good, sensible working practice by local authorities. That is a perfectly straightforward question. Does she believe that the consultation with the bodies listed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0808">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 847</span>
the amendment would be part and parcel of good, sensible working behaviour and methods by local authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope I have made it clear that local authorities should be working closely with other agencies, and certainly the ones that the hon. Gentleman specifies in his amendment. But there should not be a specific requirement laid down in legislation that, prior to issuing contracts, they should consult those groups or that they should issue plans on those aspects alone as opposed to their overall community care plans. That would be too detailed, too specific and too onerous for local authorities. However, local authorities should certainly be consulting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be fair to interpret that as meaning yes? All I wanted was a simple answer to a simple question. If I follow the hieroglyphics of the Minister's response correctly, the Government are saying that they want such bodies to be consulted or involved, and that is good working practice. We seem to have a mirror image of what we had earlier in the week with the Secretary of State. When the Government want local authorities to do something, they are not allowed to have any provision in the Bill that tells them to do it. However, when the Secretary of State does not think that he needs a power, he wants to have that power just in case at a later date he needs to exercise it. That is what the Secretary of State was saying. I do not know what kind of logic that is from the Department of Health. Either we need clearer ministerial answers or better Civil Service briefings—or, as I suspect, far more initial thought put into the drafting of a Bill and the political intent behind it.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for characteristically seeking to clarify and succeeding in confusing the issue still further. However, I shall not press the matter to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to withdraw the amendment, with the leave of the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 848</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) In a home run by a person registered under the Registered Homes Act 1984, a statement of rights shall be on public display, covering standards of care, discharge procedures, complaint procedures, and monitoring and assessment of need.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(7) All residents and their relatives shall be given information when a resident enters a registered home about how to make a complaint and registration authorities shall implement a formal complaints procedure.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(8) A registered home shall permit the authorised representative of a resident, if so requested by the resident, to have the right of advocacy as set out in the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986.".</p></blockquote>
I realise that it is setting late, and I shall be brief. That is not to say that the issues raised in amendment No. 330 are not important. It seeks to add three subsections to clause 37, and I shall deal with them in turn.<br><br>
People are disempowered when they enter institutional care, and they may suffer a loss of independence and dignity. I visited a home in Leeds that had a bulk order method of bathing. A home that deals with 50, 60 or more elderly people needs to have a routine for bathing. That home contained elderly ladies, many of whom were confused. It developed a system of bathing two old ladies at the same time with two members of staff standing between the two baths. That appalled me. It was justified by the claim that the old ladies were so doolally that they did not care. I am sure that all hon. Members would deplore that attitude.<br><br>
Proposed subsection (6) stresses the need for a statement of rights to protect individuals in care. In support of the amendment, I shall refer to various studies that have been endorsed by the Government. The code of practice for residential care issued by the Centre for Policy on Ageing recommends that all residents and, where necessary, their sponsors, should be given, in writing, a clear statement of terms under which accommodation is offered, that is sensible. In West Germany, the law states that homes must have a contractual relationship with their clients. People then know their rights in law and what to expect. No such law exists in Britain. New clause 6, which we shall discuss later, is based on a ten-minute Bill that was promoted by me in the last Session. I am worried about people being discharged against their will and sometimes literally pushed out on to the streets in less than desirable circumstances.<br><br>
Proposed subsection (7) in amendment No. 330 is based on the Wagner report. I hope that the Minister is familiar with that. Paragraph 19 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In order to provide some built in protection for users' rights we consider that each residential services provider must have a clear and well publicised complaints system to which users can turn when they are dissatisfied with a decision reached in their case, or when the service previously agreed is not giving the results they had expected or wished."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has a copy of that report.<br><br>
Proposed subsection (8) is based on paragraph 20, which recommends the services of an advocate or personal representative who is independent of those who provide the service. My hon. friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) would probably make a speech himself if it was earlier in the day about the provisions of the Bill. People who end up in care cannot stand up for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene. I am delighted that he has

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 849</span>
mentioned this important legislation. It is scandalous that the Government are refusing to recognise that on the statute book exists a structure for community care and a structure for advocacy. The vulnerable people whom my hon. Friend described—elderly, disabled people grappling with the intricacies of the social security system—are the very people who would benefit from advocacy. I am glad that my hon. Friend is presenting this as a trailer for further references to this legislation in the Committee's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to the efforts of my hon. Friend, which are deeply appreciated by many thousands of disabled people. Many people affected by the Bill, such as those who are confused, cannot stand up for themselves.<br><br>
1015 pm<br><br>
One of my amendments, which has not been selected, would have established a similar provision. In the last fortnight a constituent came to me about her brother. The lady, who is retired, could be described as elderly. She used to work in the Health Service and has given a great deal to the caring profession. She is thinking about a time when she will no longer be around, because her younger brother, who is disabled, is in a private home in my constituency. I do not know the nature of his handicap, but he cannot communicate. His sister is worried about who will speak for him when she is no longer around as she is his only relative. Who will look after his interests and deal with problems on his behalf?<br><br>
I hope that because the amendment is based on proposals in the Wagner report that the Government have already accepted in general, the Minister will have not difficulty in accepting it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be a spoilsport, but I am afraid that I shall not accept the amendment. We appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point; after all, our proposals were based on the Wagner report recommendations which, in paragraph 5.15 of the White Paper, form part of the monitoring proposals. We shall be issuing guidance as soon as possible following consultation with those who work in this field. Final guidance will be in place by April of next year.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman may know, the residential care home regulations already require a registered person to inform every resident in writing how a complaint about the home can be made and to ensure that such information is available at all times to residents and their representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to refer to that. What sanctions are available to the local authority where the home concerned does not put up such information. One of the amendments that I discussed with the Committee Clerk dealt with the point that local authority cannot impose sanctions. The Minister can seek guidance from his officials, but that is the information that I have had from the director of social services in my area. We are anxious to ensure that there is a provision for that in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will find out. The hon. Gentleman is right—this was a fast ball. However, I am not sure what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 850</span>
sanctions there would be if people did not put up the notices, or indeed, not put them up where they can be seen. Messages can be put up in buildings in ways which may squeeze past the law but which are not necessarily clear to people who might want or need to read them. We are not saying that people cannot or should not put up notices. We are simply saying that the Bill should not require them to be put up. Some form of public display may be included in the guidance, but I cannot say at this stage.<br><br>
We shall note representations from hon. Members on the issue.<br><br>
We appreciate the need for a complaints procedure and want, as much as anyone, decent, reasonable well-run homes, whether private, voluntary or run by the local authority. The amendment is unnecessary and we shall resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That response is inadequate. The Minister is not adequately briefed on some specifics and it may be appropriate to give him more time to examine the issue. If the Government are serious about the Wagner report, they should put it's recommendations into action through legislation. On the basis that I hope that the Minister will take note of the comments by his civil servants and perhaps return later to the issue—as we shall—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that it is late, but I know that many voluntary, professional and other bodies have done and will continue to do a great deal of work in the service of our deliberations. Although I do not wish to weary the Committee, it is right for me to put on record
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0810">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 851</span>
some important matters and invite the appropriate Minister to respond.<br><br>
Amendment No. 581 deals with registration and fees. The Registered Homes Act 1984 allows the Secretary of State for Health to set fees for the registration of residential care homes. Those are set for annual regulation and vary from a registration fee payable by a manager of £155 to an annual fee for a place of £28. The Department's advice reminds local authorities:
<br><blockquote><p>"The registration and inspection system is intended not only to ensure appropriate standards but also to enable constructive advice to be offered to help raise the quality of care. It also offers the opportunity to engage the co-operation of the private and voluntary sectors in developing a local strategy for residential and community care."</p></blockquote>
The fees to which the amendment refers were set in July 1989. The Department informed local authorities that it would not consider uprating those fees until it had a chance to analyse returns from a circular sent out in October 1989 entitled, "Registered Homes Act 1984: Registration Accounts." The fees for places are causing the biggest loss to local government. That must be considered in the context of the obligations that we are placing on local councils—including the poll tax—and the criticisms that will be made of them for allegedly overspending because they are endeavouring to carry out their responsibilities.<br><br>
Under pressure from local authority associations, including the ACC and AMA, the Department has agreed, for the first time, to devise a system under which fees can be compared nationally and how those can be reflected in true costs throughout local authorities. The AMA has argued for many years that those fees do not meet the true cost of inspection. New regulations introduced in 1989 require local authorities to inspect homes twice a year. The Department of Health's guidance says:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is a minimum and where the situation warrants it homes should be inspected or visited more often … Authorities should carry out at least one inspection a year without prior notice."</p></blockquote>
Sadly, evidence shows that however well local authorities try, is it impossible to do that within existing financial restraints, especially based on the limitations of the existing fee. Although the gap has been narrowed with a £1 fee bringing in £182,000 nationally, there is still a shortfall. In 1990, this is estimated at £34 per place—the difference between the current fee of £28 and the current cost of £62 for providing the registration and inspection service. The shortfall could pay for 300 additional inspectors and support staff. They could be extremely valuable in promoting the quality of care that several Ministers have said is the Government's objective.<br><br>
None of these calculations and assumptions has begun to consider the possible extension of legislation that might follow from the Bill. The amendment addresses a large deficit of some £6 million. The Government cannot leave it to local authorities, but must come up with an answer. If the amendment is not seen by the Government to be the answer, perhaps they will tell the Committee and the local authorities what they have in mind.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 581 is to cut through the difficulties. The costs of registration and inspection
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 852</span>
are ascertainable and can be subject to order. Local authorities shoud be free to recoup their costs. Continuing to featherbed the private sector should not be part of the Government's policy, especially when there seems to be evidence of discrimination against the local authorities.<br><br>
Amendment No. 725 raises an important issue that may have been overlooked in the drafting of the Bill and creates an opportunity to put it right. At present, the NHS—DHAs in particular—has a duty to register and inspect nursing homes. The local authority has similar responsibilities for residential care homes. This has been relatively satisfactory in the past, but only because local authorities had no financial responsibility or powers in relation to residents of nursing homes. Clause 37 appears to give local authorities power to top up the payments of residents of nursing homes to the level of charges made. The Deparment of Health clearly intends that local authorities should not place people in such homes without the consent of the health authority.<br><br>
However, in giving local authorities new responsibilities, the Department of Health seems to have overlooked the need for local authorities to ensure that they are getting value for money and that the patient is satisfied with the standards of care that the authority requires. As drafted, the Bill gives no power to local authorities in this respect, apparently expecting them to rely on information from health authorities. This seems very unsatisfactory and will be an obstacle to local authorities in exercising monitoring of the quality of care as well as the legitimacy of their expenditure.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the registering health authority consults fully with the appropriate local authority before registering a nursing home. This will be even more important when local authorities assume responsibility for making payments towards the fees of certain residents of nursing homes. Local authorities will be assuming greater responsibilities in respect of nursing homes, both by being able to place people in them and by being permitted to top up a patient's income to meet care and nursing costs. At present, they have no adequate rights of entry to inspect care arrangements, and it will be necessary to involve local authority personnel in these inspections.<br><br>
This is a probing amendment whether the Government intend to deny right of entry and inspection to local authorities that are having to meet part of the cost and, if not, whether local authorities are to be given statutory powers.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Committee for allowing me to place on record these strongly held views. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p>10.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) is as guileful and friendly as ever on these issues, but I do not fully accept his proposals.<br><br>
Fees are a matter of interest, but the fees, which have only recently been set are open to reconsideration in due course. It is less than a year since they were set, so it is quite easy to say that. The right to have variations for local authorities could lead to abuse and to a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0811">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 853</span>
temptation not to have full discipline in the Department or for it to abuse its position vis-a-vis the private sector. The nationally set fees, which apply mainly to small businesses, as residential homes tend to be small, are better assured by having the certainty that a national fee level permits. At this time that is the best approach; therefore we do not accept the hon. Gentleman's proposals.<br><br>
Amendment No. 725 is interesting. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that in the White Paper the Government left the registration of nursing homes with the health authorities and said that it should remain there. We believe that that should continue to happen. Local authorities will place people in nursing homes from time to time. Their right would be exercised through their contract powers. The placing of clients, through their contractual buying of places in nursing homes, would give them the entry to see how were run.<br><br>
Basically, we agree that the local authorities and health authorities would have to work closely together, not only on this matter but generally in the provision of services to people in the locality. Certainly in Wales we look to the local authorities to take the lead to set joint care plans, which is slightly different from the arrangements in England. We expect that throughout the country they will work closely together. In this instance, however, it would simply hold things up and would not contribute to the smooth running of the system or easier registration by the health authorities, which are best placed to do it, if we allowed the local authorities to have the statutory right to take part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I should be greateful for small mercies. My hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) must be feeling some satisfaction in acknowledging that the Minister, ever so gently, seemed to recognise that the private sector was capable of abusing the system. That was the first suggestion in his comments that that was even part of the Government's thinking.<br><br>
To turn to the important thrust of amendments Nos. 581 and 582, it would be wise for the Minister and his colleagues to undertake discussions with the local authority associations. In the light of current and future constraints, £6 million represents a considerable amount and a great deal of pressure on local authorities.<br><br>
The local authority associations are anxious to undertake inspections. They see the need for them and accept that an important obligation is placed upon them. It is not enough for the Government, as Governments so often do, to place obligations on local authorities and decline to give them the necessary resources. If there are to be proper inspections, and in due course a report to the House on community care matters, which my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield would welcome, we shall find that local authorities are not capable of undertaking these inspections because they do not have the money. The Government have not given them the power to charge fees that meet the cost of the inspection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me right, fees were last looked at in July 1989. My information
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 854</span>
from the local authority is that even at that time it was underfunded because of the registration fees. Accepting that it is only a short time since fees were looked at, will the Minister give an undertaking that when they are next considered the full cost of registration will be recouped?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my hon. Friend has made an extremely valid point, which I hope that the Minister will take on board. We urge the Minister to continue to consult the local authority associations, and no doubt the Minister would expect Opposition Members to do likewise between now and Report, because it is important to return to the matter on Report. I shall not press the amendments. It may help the Committee if I agree to withdraw them, with the idea of looking at the matter again on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 751, in page 39, line 29, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The Secretary of State shall by regulations, a draft of which has been approved by both Houses of Parliament, prescribe those matters to which a local authority shall give consideration in assessing the suitability and fitness of a voluntary organisation or a person to be appointed the agent of that authority for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) above."</p></blockquote>
The amendment makes a simple point and I shall not need more than an hour and a half to explain it. It would give to the local authority the opportunity to carry out background checks on domiciliary staff. The Committee showed itself to be anxious earlier in the day about the background convictions of managers of residential homes. A fortiori, those people who, in effect have unrestricted access to the homes of, by definition, very vulnerable people should have impeccable backgrounds. It seems to me and to the Association of Directors of Social Services entirely reasonable to require those who are given this considerable responsibility to show that they have backgrounds in which both the local authority and the recipients of the service can have trust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchcliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of the amendment, which has the support of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I tabled amendment No. 642, which was not selected. It has, I suspect, a completely different source from that of the amendment of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) but the same basic aims. The hon. Gentleman made some valid points, but if authorities sub-contract services to individual private companies or voluntary organisations, there should be some way to ensure that those who will be in contact with the clients, in their own rooms or wherever, are suitable people who are unlikely to offend or harm them. I am happy, therefore, to support the amendment and I hope that the Government will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not accept the amendment because it is not right to lay down in regulations the details to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) refers, but I note his concern. Hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0812">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 855</span>
Members have made it clear that, with the development of provision from a variety of sources, a local authority needs to be satisfied about the quality of care provided. I lose all patience with the suggestion that those from the voluntary, local authority or private sectors are now to behave in a less helpful way.<br><br>
I refer my hon. Friend to paragraph 349 of the White Paper, "Caring for People", on the subject of quality. I hope that the following will be a sufficient safeguard:
<br><blockquote><p>"It will be essential that, whenever they purchase services, social service authorities should take steps to ensure that the quality to be delivered is clearly specified and properly monitored, bearing in mind that vulnerable people are involved as users."</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members will be reassured by what follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"The authority should be clear in advance how it will deal with a situation where a contractor is not providing an acceptable service."</p></blockquote>
Those are clear and specific requirements.<br><br>
In our guidance to local authorities about the way in which they undertake their purchasing and set up the contract, it is precisely that sort of safeguard that in practice provides the levers and the insurance that we all wish to see in the provision of services. We need much more effective and specific levers in the establishment of contracts that the requirement to set up regulations from Westminster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I here what my hon. Friend the Minister says, but it overlooks the possibility that a high standard of service can be delivered by total crooks. It would be perfectly possible for a home help or domiciliary nurse to provide excellent nursing or cleaning care for a considerable time and, when she or he had determined which houses were most worthy of robbery, to take things away.<br><br>
Although the aspirations in the White Paper are entirely reasonable, the Minister should take seriously
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 856</span>
the anxiety of the Association of Directors of Social Services, which makes it clear that it wants to be sure that the form of words that the Minister has chosen to defend gives it the right to make the sort of inquiries into people's backgrounds that many of them would resent enormously. If that is what she means, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is essential that local authorities exercise due diligence when placing contracts. That is precisely what we are discussing to ensure that authorities have taken the necessary safeguards on a number of counts, to be sure that those contracts are not just light peices of paper. They spell out precisely what is required, to the standards required, on the basis of the safeguards that they will need to take. We shall look to local authorities to ensure that they have the proper processes, and the necessary arrangements in hand to make sure that they can exercise the diligence that we look to them for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I welcome my hon. Friend's assurance. Because I feel that she is sincere in the desire to ensure that local authority care managers and care providers exercise due diligence, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
