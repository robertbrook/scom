	<div class='clause'>Clause 62</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>TRANSFER OF UNITED KINGDOM BRANCH OR AGENCY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The overall effect of clause 62 is to allow an overseas company that carried on a trade in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to incorporate that branch or agency into a fully-fledged United Kingdom company, equally liable to United Kingdom tax, on a tax-free basis. The act of incorporation would not incur additional tax simply by virtue of taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seems to us to be relatively unexceptionable but there is one point on which we should like guidance: An overseas company might wish to incorporate its branch or subsidiary here to sell a United Kingdom overseas branch as a United Kingdom company. There would be no tax charge on the sale of the shares in the United Kingdom subsidiary, so allowing tax-free incorporation. This seems to us to allow United Kingdom tax to be deferred or avoided in certain cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is posssible that section 278 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 would come into operation to cover such case, but the position is not clear, and we are not sure whether that section comes into play and would, in effect, crystallise the deferred capital capital gains charge. If the relief under clause 62 is claimed, and soon after that the company is sold to a third party, will the gains rolled over under clause 62 be crystallised when that company is sold? The provisions are not clear. Does section 278 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 apply, and will the crystallisation take place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would welcome assurance from the Government on that question, but we are happy to accept the broad principle of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) for giving me notice of his question. I understand that section 278 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, to which he referred, imposes charges on certain deferred gains when a company leaves a group, as the hon. Gentleman described. The answer to his question is no, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
section will not apply to gains deferred under the clause. There is no reason for it to do so, as the clause will not itself create extra scope for avoidance; of that the Inland Revenue is certain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Economic Secretary says, but the potential for avoidance remains if, using the relief from taxation provided by clause 62, a branch is transmuted into a company to facilitate an onward sale, so relieving the selling company from tax. I am grateful for the Economic Secretary's clarification of the non-applicability of section 278 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, but his answer leaves me somewhat apprehensive. Had that section applied, crystallising provisions would have been in place. As we now know that that is not so, we must watch what happens as a result of clause 62 very carefully indeed. We are worried that there is the potential scope for a bit of sharp practice by companies deliberately using the provisions to transmute a branch into a company. That possibility is something that we are keen to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appear to believe their own assurance that there is no problem here. We shall watch very carefully to ascertain whether that is true. We suspect that it may not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 63</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RELIEF FOR INTEREST</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 63, which deals with relief for interest, reveals one of the Chancellor's little victories over the Prime Minister. It shows how the Government do not want to see a steady increase in the threshold for mortgage interest relief. They regard such relief as a limited and perhaps declining part of the housing subsidy system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mortgage interest tax relief is a housing subsidy, with a stated objective of helping to promote home ownership. There is a strong case for making it part of a wider system of support that would assist householders who rent as well as those who buy, yet no such social argument can be made for continuing to pay mortgage interest relief at the higher rate of tax. We have sought, in successive Budgets and Finance Bill debates, to make the Government recognise that there is no logic in giving greater help to the richest people, who pay the highest rate of tax, to buy their houses than is given to those on lower incomes. The logical thing is to confine the relief to the standard rate of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be interesting to hear, in the context of the decision to include this clause in the Bill, what is the Government's current thinking on mortgage interest relief. If they had limited it to the standard rate of tax last year, they would have saved £440 million. That is a handy sum, for which I am sure the Government could have found good uses. Moreover, they would have ended a biased form of subsidy whose assistance appears to be tilted towards those who are least in need
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
of it. The decision not to index the threshold to the standard rate of tax shows that the Government are to some extent worried about the system's operation, although I still cannot understand why their anxiety does not extend to the relief at the high rate of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government had increased the threshold this year, it would not have helped home buyers. It would have made things more difficult for first-time buyers and had strong repercussions in a housing market that has had enough repercussions to last it a long time. I agree with the Government's decision to keep the level as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) has outlined the provisions in the clause. I congratulate the Government on their sensible decision to keep the ceiling at £30,000 this year. Before the Budget, there were rumours that the Government might be considering changes, but they were right and proper in deciding not to do that. We shall not try to divide the Committee on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, as we made clear in a similar debate on last year's Finance Bill, we cannot do anything more sensible, such as restrict the benefit of mortgage interest relief to the standard rate of tax because of the rules under which discussions on the Finance Bill are drawn. The clause limits relief to the overall sum of £30,000. We support that provision and we are glad that the Government saw sense and put it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the great things is the freedom to speak from the Back Benches. Doubtless our words can be quoted back at us later, but I do not believe that there is any place for mortgage interest relief in a fair income tax system. I am speaking entirely personally and my hon. Friends are not committed to what I say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mortgage interest relief, like so many of the other major handouts and subsidies given to the relatively well-off, rather than the less fortunate, should be abolished so that our income tax system is what a local tax system should be—a fair system based on the ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is currently constituted, mortgage interest relief gives back about £7 billion of taxpayers' money to certain taxpayers. By definition, they are taxpayers who own their own homes and might benefit from a lower rate of income tax rather than a direct subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully realise that the hon. Gentleman is expressing his personal view, but is he urging on his colleagues in the Labour party a policy of complete fiscal neutrality and suggesting that the tax system should not be used for any social objective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful. I know that, with his normal generosity, he is trying to assist me, but his interpretation is not entirely correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we looked at the tax system as a means of social engineering, other areas could be considered, but the Government do not regard the tax relief currently given on mortgage interest as direct social engineering. The hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) may agree or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
not, but there are historical, and perhaps even political, reasons why we are stuck with the current set-up. Those reasons apply equally strongly to the Front Benches of both major political parties because of their electoral implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to state an objective from my privileged position on the Back Benches. The relief and lack of neutrality in that part of the tax system does not work to the advantage of everyone. It works to the advantage of only a few. The same may be said about not having capital gains tax on the sale of houses. In the past year, the Treasury has forgone a revenue of about £10 billion. In a dream land where I am the shadow Chancellor and the hon. Member for Esher is Chancellor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chancellor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes. I would be glad to push the hon. Gentleman's prospects, although his Front-Bench colleagues may not endorse my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The income tax system should be used in some areas, but in those areas where it is currently used, people on lower incomes do not benefit. Let us consider current efforts to encourage wider share ownership. People who can buy shares are in many cases the last people to whom handouts should be given when money is tight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also attempted to encourage the run-down of the national health service by promoting private health care. They have induced older people to take out schemes—subsidised through the tax system—to ensure that private health is supported. Personal pension schemes are another good example. This year, £800 million of taxpayers' money is going into them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to distinguish between tax relief on personal pension schemes and that on corporate schemes. Does he intend to make that distinction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to make is that were we to deal with many large subsidies—including those on private pension schemes—we could do what the Government claim that they want to do and reduce the income tax burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were an incoming Labour Government to deal with massive, multi-billion pound subsidies that go to the more privileged end of the social spectrum, I believe that they could reduce the basic level of income tax to 20p in the pound. It would help us electorally if we could grasp that opportunity. I understand that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench face a large number of constraints that may prevent them from proposing that before the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The income tax system has been distorted because subsidies have been allowed to persist. The Government are alleged to be radical, but they are now clearly running out of steam. They have failed to grasp that nettle. Even the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) could not win his battle to remove the distortion in the income tax system that is the subject of this clause—tax relief on mortgage interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
The Government have been active in removing a large number of other subsidies, but they have invariably got rid of subsidies that benefit people on low incomes, the unemployed and industry in general. The billions of pounds still flowing out of the Treasury will have to be examined very seriously by whatever party wins the next general election. That Government will face an economic crisis of such magnitude that these major areas of Government susidy will have to be re-examined seriously, irrespective of the pledges made in party manifestoes. Without the cushion of North sea oil and asset sales, serious rethinking will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends on the Front Bench and I want major investment programmes in education, training, industry and regional policy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going very wide of the clause under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mortgage interest relief, along with many other subsidies, would have to be examined seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Martlew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend does not mean that we should go to the electorate with a false prospectus, laying out our tax policies before the next election and not changing, taxes afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What may well happen is that the scale of the economic crisis will be such that it will transcend even our honest and open efforts to achieve what we want. I give Conservative Members credit for putting forward an honest policy at the next election, but they, too, will find that the days when they could finance their taxation policy by the sale of state assets and the use of North sea oil revenues have come to an end. The next Government will face horrendous circumstances in which mortgage interest relief, which is a sacred cow to both parties, may be slightly infected with BSE and need to be slaughtered on the altar of tax subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share with my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham North (Mr. Allen) his belief that the £7 billion of revenue forgone in mortgage interest relief is poorly targeted. I also endorse the comments made by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) that it benefits holders of big mortgages rather more than those with small mortgages. It assists better established people at the expense of those who are less well established and, of course, it tends to benefit people in the south far more than it does those who live in the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question relates to a category of people who, in a sense, are not affected by the workings of the clause. I refer to those owner occupiers who do not have mortgages. We lose sight of the fact that 40 per cent or more of owner occupiers do not have mortgages, so they do not benefit from mortgage interest relief. Of course, some are wealthy people who paid off their mortgages long ago because they had the necessary, resources, but that is uncommon. Owner occupiers without mortgages and the benefit of mortgage interest relief are commonly the oldest and poorest members of that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
group. They encounter enormous problems with maintaining their properties for themselves and those who will later inherit or purchase them. That is one of the difficulties that cause the creditworthiness of the housing stock to decline, but to maintain it must be one of the central objectives of mortgage interest relief. However, those people are excluded from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of changes in the social security system, unless one is on income support, one cannot qualify for state-subsidised home improvement grants. Many of these people are fractionally too well off and have slightly too much income to receive such assistance. There is a category of owner occupiers, who are numerous, who are especially to be found in such places as Durham, Tyneside, the valleys of Wales, Lancashire, west Yorkshire and Makerfield—let us never forget Makerfield—who are fogotten. They do not have access to the present system of home improvements grants or to mortgage interest relief because they have no mortgages. Many of them are old, and it is critical for the maintenance of their property, which is a proper objective, to release some of the equity value of their houses into their incomes. That would allow them to maintain their independence and prevent their falling into dependence on residential care, so it should be a central objective of public policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter was debated last year, but the Government rejected the proposals that were put to them. Does the Minister recognise that a problem exists, and do the Government intend to tackle it, perhaps through the social security system if not the tax system? It relates to elderly owner occupiers who have just enough income to be outside the income support system but insufficient income properly to maintain themselves or their properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) began by putting the case for abolishing tax relief on mortgages. I refer him to the remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, then the Chief Secretary, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is unsurprising that the value of relief is greater for higher rate taxpayers. We have a progressive tax system and the system of tax relief follows it, and has done for many years."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 9 June 1988; c. 355.]</p></blockquote>
If there was a case for removing top-rate relief, it was stronger during the heady days of the Lib-Lab pact when the discrepancy between the basic rate and top rate was at least 50p in the pound rather than 15p in the pound as it is now. One of the great advantages of our reducing tax rates is that we have reduced any distortions that existed as a result of the wide spectrum of rates. The hon. Gentleman's proposal to phase out the top rate is only the tip of the iceberg. The hon. Gentleman is being discreet about the fact that Liberal policy is to phase out mortgage relief over 15 years. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will contradict me if I am wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>Rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Gentleman a chance to think of an answer to that rather simple question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister was going to explain our proposal—although we did not vote on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
it—that the system should be replaced by one that gives relief to those who purchase and those who rent property. It certainly would not remove relief from those who have taken out mortgages in the expectation that they will obtain tax relief. We would not countenance any change that took away relief from people who had taken out mortgages on that assumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that leaves the Committee pretty confused, but we need not dwell long on Liberal policies these days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only £1 in £16 of mortgage interest relief goes to upper rate income tax payers so it is not a huge element of the total bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary seems to be dismissing £450 million as a negligible amount in the nation's account, but it is nearly £0.5 billion of effective public expenditure. I am surprised that he is so dismissive of that sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not dismissive; I am merely putting it in context. I should be interested to know whether the hon. Gentleman proposes to realise the sum by depriving those who already have mortgages of the relief. I could reduce it by another large fraction if we were talking only about the relief that might apply to a future category of mortgage payers who have not yet got mortgages or reached the upper income brackets. One would then find that it is quite a small sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) did not spell out the Labour party's position on these matters, despite the urgings of the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew). We would have been interested to hear more from the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who said that first-time buyers would receive special relief. No explanation was offered about problems of locking people into their first homes, inhibiting employment mobility and the unfairness to those who are obliged to move, nor was mention made of whether this special benefit was to be in cash or tax. If it were in tax, would it be higher than the 25 per cent rate of relief that a basic rate payer can now enjoy or would relief at 25 per cent be given on a larger amount than £30,000? We were told little, and I am glad that the hon. Member for Carlisle wishes to join me in urging his Front Bench to explain matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very surprised to hear the Minister talk about mortgages or relief. The majority of my constituents would be happy for him to do away with tax relief if he could lower interest rates by 5 per cent. It comes badly from a Minister in a Government responsible for record interest rates and mortgage repayments, which have led to a massive number of people being in arrears, to talk about the policies of other parties. Is the Minister prepared to do anything about high interest rates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And when?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows our position on that. Were I to reiterate it at any length, I should be ruled out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>>
The speech of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) reflects his view, which I have!no doubt is widespread on the Labour Benches, that this relief should be abolished entirely: The hon. Gentleman said that only a small number of people benefit from mortgage interest relief, but in fact 9.4 million people and their families benefit. That is not a small number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the Government had closed loopholes only for the poor, but tax loopholes are not normally the province of the poor. We have abolished a whole range, including some relating to the excessive extension of mortgage interest relief which allowed an element of abuse. We have also abolished life assurance premium relief for new policies, reformed the forestry tax regime and steadily raised the scales for company cars. We have done quite a lot that I hope will appeal to the hon. Gentleman's almost Friedmanite desire for fiscal purity. I could see an interesting alliance forming between some of my hon. Friends and one or two Opposition Back Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a practising monetarist to a former monetarist, will the Minister give us an honest appraisal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which is which?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister does not like hypothesis, but let us imagine that there was no relief on mortgage interest. Surely in those circumstances he would not propose using £7 billion of public expenditure to institute a system of mortgage interest relief. Of course he would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat my earlier point in respect of my hon. Friends. If £7 billion of public money was available and could be spent on mortgage interest relief, revitalising our health service, setting up high-speed links to the channel tunnel and/or investing in education and training, I suspect that the Minister, like my hon. Friends, would choose the latter options rather than a handout in the form of mortgage interest relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The good news is that the hon. Gentleman's views about not wishing to start from here reflect the views expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, I am less rash about answering hypothetical questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bad news is that I do not believe that this is an item of public expenditure. It is an abatement of taxation. If it were abandoned, I would want that to lead to billions of pounds worth of extra public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just so that we can get it clear, is the Financial Secretary saying that an abatement of taxation that would normally be left in particular circumstances is not the equivalent, in Exchequer terms, of public expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. There can be no comparison. There is a marked difference between public expenditure and reliefs which reduce the tax burden.

Any suggestion otherwise implies that all money belongs to the state unless the state, out of the goodness of its heart, decides not to take a certain element of it. That is not the attitude of Conservative Members, although I realise that Opposition Members hold that belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's commitment to relief has been stated frequently and confirmed on several occasions by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. Mortgage interest relief has helped millions of people to purchase their own homes. Over 66 per cent of all dwellings, the highest proportion ever, is now owner-occupied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members, perhaps not members of the Committee, have argued on the Floor of the House that, at £30,000, the limit for mortgage interest relief is only a quarter of the purchase price of a modest house in the London area and that that proportion will keep going down. Why does the Minister believe that it is wrong for the threshold to keep pace with the inflation in house prices?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinct contradiction between the views expressed by the hon. Gentleman now and earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was making an intellectual inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We review the matter every year in the light of circumstances and this year we thought it right to keep the level as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME: ABOLITION OF "LOCALITY RULE"</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 52, line 34, after "date" insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>"and (unless there has been a major scheme of reconstruction in the locality in which the dwelling house is situated which has caused a substantial reduction since the valuation date in the average value of residential accommodation in that locality) on the additional assumption that the locality in which the dwelling house is situated was in the same state, so far as concerns the other premises situated in that locality and the occupation and use of those premises, the transport services and other faclities available in the locality, and other matters affecting the amenities of the locality, as at that date.".</p></blockquote>
This debate deals with the business expansion scheme. It would perhaps be helpful for me to clarify the Opposition's attitude towards the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme was introduced in 1983 and had its origins in the business start-up scheme of 1981. In 1983, we were prepared to give the scheme a fair wind. We believed that it was right to do what we could to encourage a genuine risk-taking enterprise that could do good and increase investment particularly, but not exclusively, in manufacturing industry. However, at the time, we took care to warn of the dangers and the potential for the scheme's misuse and abuse and the possibility for tax evasion. How right we were to give
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
those warnings because that is precisely what occurred—and with the positive encouragement and support of Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell me that it is not true!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, was responsible for the most gross distortion of the tax system in his 1988 Budget. Some Conservative Members bridle with shame to this day—one is doing so visibly now—at what occured then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rot had set in before then. Even before the 1988 Budget introduced the rented property scheme, with which we are especially involved tonight, the pattern of BES investments had begun to change, just as we predicted and feared. It moved away from its supposed original intentions when the scheme was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) first drew to the attention of the House the purport of the research published by the Small Business Research Trust. It showed clearly that BES was, even then, being increasingly being used for asset-backed and non-risky enterprises, particularly in the wholesale, retail, real estate and leisure sectors of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Committee Members were on the Housing Bill Committee in 1988 when the proposed extension of the BES to the rented property sector was first aired. It was introduced with a great fanfare. It was to be the stimulus for a massive explosion. It was trumpted from on high by the then Secretary of State for Employment, the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir Norman Fowler). He announced to an astounded Committee the Government's intention to extend the scheme in a way that would underpin the explosion of the private—rented sector. Of course, no such explosion occured, but the true nature of the BES has been revealed by a series of questions tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and for Islington, South and Finsbury. The amendment seeks to change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a considerable abatement of taxation—that is apparently how we should describe £110 million flung in the direction of landlords seeking to establish private—rented property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That £110 million is an interesting figure, during the past four years, my local authority has lost in excess of £190 million in housing investment programme money and in capital expenditure on the refurbishment of its property. In housing action areas, 100 per cent of that money goes straight to the private-rented sector and to private owner-occupiers in terraced housing. To pay for that, local authorities that were providing assistance to the private sector have had those resources withdrawn to the detriment of the private-rented sector in the north-west and other regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend. He will remember giving the same warning when the matter was first introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again and again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Almost ad nauseam, if such a thing is possible from my hon. Friend. We warned the Government what the consequences would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having some trouble in finding that figure in the Red Book. Will the hon. Gentleman say exactly what will be the effect on the economy of the change in the locality rule for this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are coming to that. The changes in the locality rule are a desperate attempt by the Government to breath new life into the BES.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to elaborate on how they hope to do that, the hon. Gentleman may intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I help the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no. We welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee today as he has been unable to attend all the Committee Sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been researching, and I have discovered the figure. According to the Red Book, the direct effect of changes in taxation due to the change in the locality rule turns out to be virtually zero. Is the hon. Gentleman not making a mountain out of a molehill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, who said that the Red Book describes the figure as negligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must bear in mind the cavalier way in which the Financial Secretary referred to the figure of £450 million. That was tossed aside as being hardly worth—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mere bagatelle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mere bagatelle, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington says. We take no comfort from the fact that the cost to the Exchequer is negligible, as the missed opportunity of the BES and the misuse that it represents is far greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two years ago that negligible figure was £340 million, but because of the failure of the scheme, it has been reduced to about £157 million. Over that period, investors have lost about £27 million from the scheme. If BSE is the mad-cow disease, BSE might be described as the mad-investors disease. Most of those who have invested in it have lost considerable sums and they are looking for ways out of the scheme, but can find none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and so great is the concern about the BES that a new BES association has been formed. It was announced in 	<i>The Independent on Sunday</i> on 22 April that its task is to try to improve the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
image of the BES. Its work will be cut out. Conservative Members may suggest how it will set about such a difficult task. I am having a little difficulty following what they are saying. Initially, it was suggested that there was a tax dodge, but now they agree that a considerable number of people have lost money, following that so-called tax dadge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful and will not follow the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who has considerable knowledge of such matters, will know that it is possible to become involved in a tax dodge that goes terribly wrong. That is why the BES is now seeking a cure for the jitters of the investors in the scheme. The tax dodge is no longer as attractive as it was. In 1983, there was a top rate of tax of 75 per cent, but that has been reduced over the years, so the scheme has become a less attractive proposition. The absence of a way out for those who have tied up their money in the scheme is causing concern. I do not think that Conservative Members would suggest that the scheme is anything other than a means of tax avoidance for high-rate taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider how the BES has been used in the past. It has been used for hotel and property development, private schools and hospitals, the establishment of restaurants, companies and a range of outlandish enterprises. The British American Cup challenge is a BES. If it is necessary to establish a haven in the BES to get a yacht from A to B in the antipodes, it makes us wonder what was in the minds of those who developed the scheme in the first place. It has been used for the purposes of racehorse breeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh dear!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us give Conservative Members a chance. Will any hon. Gentleman voice his support for the BES as a means of stimulating racehorses? [Hon. Members: "Yes."] I will happily give way to anyone, who will seriously justify the BES on the basis of the stimulation of stallions and the impregnation of brood mares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on, stand up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not perhaps the right point to make that it ill behoves politicans to reach valued judgments on the quality of any investment. That matter is best left to private investors. The British racing industry is successful and has attracted much foreign investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The interesting point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is in line with his constant stand on such matters. I cannot help wondering why such a successful and well-estalished business should be described as a "risky" business and deserving of that specific tax break. That is not easily comprehensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the fine details of the amendment. The clause will do away with a specific restriction on the impact of section 50 of the Finance Act 1988, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
enabled BES to cover investment in companies that let residential accommodation on assured tenancies. In addition to imposing certain limitations on the value of those premises, it dealt also with a property that was done up or what happens if the locality in which it was situated became more desirable. For example, we are told that London Docklands is more desirable than it once was—I am referring to areas where the tram has given way to the Porche.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend remembers that speech!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only do I remember that speech, but I even dredged up some of it up from the recesses of my memory. We were worried about the impact of that form of development on long-established communities. Presumably, with such a development in mind, it was considered necesssary to make a proviso about the increased desirability of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, that proviso will not be taken into account. If, as a result of an area becoming more desirable, the limits on the value of a property are exceeded, that will not cause the specific investment to cease to qualify for BES. Such a provision is an undesirable attempt to beathe new life into an undesirable and unhelpful proposal. We would scrap it; it should not be misued in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to consider how BES might be used for its genuine and original purpose, which is to encourage new investment and the taking of risks in legitimate enterprises which benefit the nation. That is a proper use of schemes such as the business expansion scheme, but it is not right to use BES to speculate in the residential property market or to provide a convenient tax shelter for the better off. That is an abuse of the system. We have consistently opposed that and will, in due course, remove it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the view that BES is fundamentally undesirable or cannot be made to work. The Labour party's view on it has changed during the past year. The anxieties that the Labour party and I expressed last year remain as valid as ever, because BES has been used heavily for investment in property and not for the purpose for which it was originally canvassed. It is a sign of the Government's failure to take account of our argument last year that unless they adjusted it in some way, it would continue to be a property-biased scheme and property would continue to suck in most of the benefits of the BES.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the other schemes to which the hon. Member for Brent, South, (Mr. Boateng) referred, although unattractive to him were a better use of the BES than the property provisions. One of our arguments to Ministers has been that use of the scheme for property investment could lead to rents being raised after five years to such artificial levels that the scheme would have provided not a permanent addition to the rented market, but a back-door method of obtaining a large subsidy for the purchase and resale of property. The BES is now manifestly failing to fulfil its purpose and I wish that the Government would take seriously the fact that it is falling far short of that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Judged by the standards of Chinese classical poetry, Sir John, the speech of the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) was outstanding.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
He and my hon. Friend's know that the principal skill of the Chinese poet is to couple together in antithetical couplets as many contradictory phrases as possible in as short a space as possible. The hon. Gentleman's speech can be condensed approximately as follows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He agreed initially with tax relief, but opposed it as soon as it attracted investors. He said that all the money went into safe assets, but his hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) said that a high proportion of investments lost money. He said that the 1988 Budget made the abuse worse, but that Budget capped the relief and reduced its value by cutting top tax rates. He said that it was over-generous, but that it had failed to attract much money. He ridiculed the BES for its use in leisure activities, but he recently held a press conference to propose that it should be extended to the cinema and film industry. He said that the clause will breathe new life into the BES, but opposes it although it is designed to rejuvenate the inner cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister opposed to special assistance for the film industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, in the past, that relief has been available to the film industry and it is still available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is he opposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman considers that relief to be a special relief, it is available to the film industry. It is odd that he criticised the use of BES in leisure activities such as racing, yet proposes a special extension and elaboration of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister opposed to further relief for the film industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly be averse to cutting that off from the film industry, but I know, Sir John, that your would not want me to go further now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the problem is that you, Sir John, do not want the Minister to go further. I think that someone else does not want him to go further at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
