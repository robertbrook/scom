<p>Government new clause 18—Settlements: child's income—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) section 663 of the Taxes Act 1988 (child's income treated as settlor's) in subsection (4) (exception for income not exceeding £5) for "£5" there shall be substituted "£100".</p></blockquote>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clause 17 and the new schedule seek to abolish composite rate tax from 6 April 1991. From that date, building societies, banks and some other deposit takers would pay interest to depositers in the United Kingdom under deduction of income tax at the basic rate. That would be the end of the matter for basic rate taxpayers—deduction at source would satisfy their tax liability. Higher rate taxpayers would be required to pay further liability by an assessment or an adjustment of their coding or other allowances. The tax offices will raise the necessary rate charges.<br><br>
People who are not liable for tax would benefit from the reform. Under enabling powers in the schedule, regulations could be made later this year that would establish a procedure enabling individuals who are, or expect to be, non-liable for tax to self certify. Interest on their savings would be paid gross, without deductions for tax. Those who did not self certify, but were non-liable, could submit a repayment claim to the Inland Revenue. They would receive a refund of the basic rate tax, deducted from their interest.<br><br>
The Government estimate that 14 million people would gain under the proposed legislation. About 13
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
million people are not liable to tax but receive interest that has suffered from composite rate tax and a further 1 million would be liable on only part of the interest that they receive. The 14 million includes 5 million married women, who are non taxpayers under independent taxation, 4 million pensioners, 2.5 million other adults and 2.5 million children.<br><br>
Self certification arrangements for people who are not liable to tax are a key part of the reform. Since the Budget announcement, the Revenue has engaged in intensive consultation with building societies and banks. It aims to ensure that a fully operational system is established well before the first interest payments on or after 6 April 1991, to which the new rules would apply.<br><br>
The design of the self-certification form has been discussed fully and will be test marketed. After making regulations to set out the procedures, the Revenue will begin a wide publicity campaign. The Government seek the maximum possible take-up by non-taxpayers. Those who do not self certify and receive their interst under tax deduction would be refunded if they were not liable for tax. The arrangements are complicated, but necessary to abolish the composite rate tax. Its abolition has been widely welcomed by hon. Members. I shall be pleased to respond to any queries. We were unable to include the clauses which arise from consultation with banks and building societies in the original Bill, and I apologise for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to new clause 18 which I call the pocket money provision. It is designed to help reasonably well-off parents invest about £1,000 per child. The £2 a week interest that they earn can be used as extra pocket money while avoiding the £40 tax on each £100 they would otherwise have paid on the investment. Conservative Members may think that £2 is small beer. Indeed, after the last Budget, small beer is precisely what we get for £2.<br><br>
Before coming to the House, many of us were involved in child care, working in communities with people—one-parent families in particular—on extremely low incomes. We find it aggravating to see this tax concession proposes, when many of the families that we represent, either professionally or as constituents, cannot afford to distribute £2 a week among their children.<br><br>
Small amounts add up. If there are 10 million families with children in the United Kingdom and one in 10 can afford to use this loophole for one and a half children, the total tax loss of the average applicable tax rate is 30 per cent. On that basis, I calculate that the sum involved is £45 million. If that kind of slack is available to be utilised for young children, it should be used for those who need the resources most.<br><br>
The Church of England Childrens Society recently produced a report on children in poverty in the United Kingdom. Astonishingly, the report found that 29 per cent. of children lived on or below the Government's designated poverty line. That means that every day of the week, all year round, 3,540,000 children live on or below the poverty line. We are not talking about a Third or Fourth world country, but Britain in 1990.<br><br>
We should use the Bill to redirect resources to those in need rather than those who can look after their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0250">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
children perfectly well. The children of those in reasonable circumstances can have new shoes and clothes and take up leisure activities, things which families and children living in poverty are denied.<br><br>
We want to consider these issues seriously. We can make a good start in this Committee by reallocating what is admittedly a small sum of money. For example, the £45 million could be allocated to local authorities to increase resources for school clothing grants. Those grants have been cut substantially, not simply because of rate support grant reductions, but changes in poll tax.<br><br>
We could redistribute the money through the social security system so that it goes to families with special needs which, because of the capping of budgets at local social security offices, do not receive those resources, even though they sometimes qualify.<br><br>
The Minister must explain why the Government have decided to utilise the money in the way proposed so that it goes to children in better-off families instead of targeting it towards families with low incomes who can use it to provide their children with the basics of family life and give them access to the things that we take for granted.<br><br>
About 360,000 children in one-parent families fall below even the Government's designated poverty level. We should target resources to bring the incomes of such families to a level whereby family budgets can provide the items that our own children take for granted.<br><br>
If we are to tackle poverty among children in Britain, not only does this £45 million or so need to be redistributed but the whole shift of resources in this Budget must be reconsidered. The Government should make a radical change in the nature of their Budgets to target the 3,500,000 children in Britain who live on or below the poverty line. Any Chancellor who fails to do that is neglecting both his duty and a substantial number of children—to their detriment and that of their families.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) down the tempting path that he has chosen—not least because I suspect that when my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary replies, he will say that the hon. Gentleman have overestimated the resource cost of the provision. From my own experience as a chartered accountant I suspect that the provision will be of net benefit to the Exchequer because of the administration costs saved.<br><br>
Instead, I shall comment on the abolition of composite rate tax which, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said in his introductory remarks, is generally to be welcomed. However, some banks and building societies have drawn my attention to a number of minor worries about the regulations that are to be introduced later this year under these clauses and schedules.<br><br>
First, given the short time scale involved in implementing the regulations by next April, all banks and building societies in the United Kingdom will inevitably have to build on existing computer systems rather than start from scratch and develop new systems
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
for the new tax. Therefore, the format of documentation will have to change radically and there is some anxiety that the strict letter of the new provisions will have to be applied from 6 April next year. Under existing provisions, it is sufficient merely to show a net sum of interest. Under the new provisions it will be necessary to show the effect of the tax deducted as a monthly amount. I know from my experience that that requires a considerable change in a computer program.<br><br>
While it will undoubtedly be the aim of every bank and building society to show a tax deduction or tax credit like a dividend for a company, there is some doubt as to whether they will be able to meet that deadline by 6 April. Provided that full information is given on any interest voucher after 6 April to enable the taxpayer to calculate the amount of tax being suffered on every interest payment, I hope that there will at least be some transitional flexibility in the form of the document.<br><br>
Secondly, the fact that non-taxpayers will be entitled to self-certify and receive interest gross is welcome. However, there are a number of investments—particularly in banks and building societies—for which marketing ceased a long time ago and which have only a residual number of holders. Inevitably, the banks and building societies will want to encourage those investors to switch from the old form of investment into one for which they can self-certify themselves gross. Nevertheless, the administrative burden on those few small investments could be considerable if the computer program has to be changed for each type of investment to allow for gross payment of interest that was never contemplated when the investment was marketed—or, indeed, after it ceased to be marketed. For example, the Abbey National buildig society ceased marketing its 40 plus bond share in September 1981, its open bond share in July 1982 and its 60 plus bond share in December 1982. The small residual number of holders of those investments would not welcome any depletion in their funds, arising from the computer costs of the changes in the interest payments system for that small number having to be borne somewhere within the building society.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
My final point is that in framing the regulations I hope that my hon. Friend will bear in mind the fact that interest payments on a number of different investments offered by financial institutions from time to time are not all made on fixed dates—say, 31 December or 31 March—but they vary. There will be transitional problems in the switch from the composite rate of tax—3 per cent lower than the basic rate—to the basic rate. I hope that there will be flexibility in allowing institutions to adapt to the basic rate from the composite rate in the short transitional period until everyone is on the basic rate.<br><br>
I suspect that all members of the Committee join me in greatly welcoming the change. I hope that it will be accompanied by a minimum of fuss and aggravation, and that the regulations will be framed with the needs of both the investor and institution in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The abolition of the composite rate has been widely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
welcomed in all parts of the House, and I welcome it again today. I think that the House would have made the change sooner had it believed that it would be possible to do it. The Government have told us for the past 10 years that abolishing the composite rate tax was a very difficult and complex task, indeed one that was impossible. I welcome the fact that it can now be done, even though the discovery has taken 10 years.<br><br>
The new clause and the amendments invite us to repeal the current provisions on composite rate tax as they relate to building societies, separtely as they relate to banks, and their associated provisions when deposits are made or withdrawn from the composite rate tax scheme. We are invited to address the reduced rate rules.<br><br>
We are also invited to introduce two new measrues to cover the new income tax-based schemes, one for building societies and one for banks. We are invited to bring local authorities into line with banks, and, separtely, we are invited to exclude from the scheme companies within seciton 3 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act 1985, and banks formed under the Savings Bank (Scotland) Act 1819. My first question is why those exclusions are being made, as we could think of no good reason for them.<br><br>
We are invited to disapply the usual rules requiring inocme tax to be deducted from interest paid, indeed that is implicit in the scheme. That leaves the heart of the matter in paragraphs 4 and 7 of the new schedule. Section 477A(3) of the Taxes Act 1988 allows for the gross interest paid by the society in a year to be deducted for corporation tax purposes. Section 477A(4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"terminal bonuses paid by a society are to be deductible despite Section 326 of the Taxes Act 1988".</p></blockquote>
Section 326 of the Taxes Act 1988 states that such bonuses
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be disregarded for all purposes of the Income Tax Acts."</p></blockquote>
If this wording does not stop a corporation tax deduction, section 477A(4) would be unecessary. The Government presumably believe that it did or might stop such a deduction. However, under clause 23 we discussed tax-exempt special savings accounts and new section 326A(1) says that all TESSA interest or bonuses
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be disregarded for all purposes of the Income Tax Acts."</p></blockquote>
Does this mean that the paying banks cannot deduct such interest in their corporation tax computations? Why must there be specific refererence to that in this section, which deals with composite rate tax, but not in clause 23, which deals with TESSAs? The Government have created an anomaly. Do the Government regard it as anomalous and will they resolve the problem?<br><br>
Paragraphs 9(2) and 9(3) of the new schedule increase the minimum periods for qualifying time deposits or deposits given qualifying certificates from seven days to five years. That is a substantial change. The Financial Secretary should justify it. The change will discourage non-residents from making deposites in the United Kingdom. The Financial Secretary should say whether that is intended.<br><br>
Paragraphs 9(4) and 9(5) of the new schedule increase the powers of the Board of the Inland Rev-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
enue to obtain information on depositors and deposits. But those provisions, in contrast to the other new sections, will have immediate effect. The Financial Secretary should explain that. Surely those provisions should sit with the other new clauses and come into effect at the same time? Is that decision due to past lax enforement of the overseas residents self-certification arrangements? Are such matters presently under investigation? Will the immediate extension of the Revenue's power assist any such investigations? Having raised those subsidiary, but important, points, I welcome the broad thrust of the Government's policy. I hope that we can give effect to their objectives, which are supported by all sides of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Wallace <span class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my absence at the start of the debate. I was in the Chamber for business questions. I support the new clause that abolishes composite rate tax from 6 April 1991. I should put on record that such a move was advocated by my hon. Friends in previous Finance Committees. Last year, my hon. and learned Friend for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) tabled an amendment to abolish composite rate tax for pensioners. It is interesting to note that in last year's Committee, the present Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that there were considerable advantages in the composite rate scheme. I am pleased that mature reflection on our arguments has convinced him that they outweigh the advantages of which he spoke. He also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am not persuaded by the Opposition's argument given the other opportunities that are open to investors, that it would be right to abolish the composite rate system as it has enormous advantages."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee C;</i> 22 June 1989, col. 620.]</p></blockquote>
Investors could invest their money in other ways to get round the problems posed by the composite rate scheme, but that highlights the damaging difficulties that have arisen because the government did not accept the argument earlier. For example, investors decided to invest money in offshore accounts where interest could be paid gross. Financial advisers did well out of that and now investors find that the advice given has been rendered null because the Government have done what they should have done earlier.<br><br>
Secondly, the introduction of the benefit has to be delayed for one year, because the provision will not take effect until the beginning of the 1991–92 tax year. Had the Government had the foresight of my hon. Friend and introduced it a year ago, we could have enjoyed its benefits from the beginning of this tax year.<br><br>
However, it would be churlish not to welcome a measure that will benefit the poorer sections of the community. In the past it was argued that the rate was set at that level because there were winners and losers. Unfortunately, the losers tended to be those least able to bear the loss.<br><br>
The measure will be welcomed by many people on lower incomes and by small clubs that place their funds in building societies or in bank accounts and have paid tax on it. They stand to benefit. I welcome the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) concentrated on new clause 18, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
deals with the £100 limit on children's income. He said that he thought that it was designed to help well-off parents to invest up to £1,000 per child and was a tax-avoidance device.<br><br>
The contrary is true. The aim of the new clause is to prevent or limit tax avoidance, but there must be a de minimis element in it. In 1932 it was set at £5 which, if indexed, would now now be between £150 and £160, so to increase the limit to £100 is not unreasonable. It will reduce considerably the compliance and administrative burden for the Inland Revenue and for banks and building societies. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) thought that the potential savings might outweigh the costs, but that remains to be seen. It will certainly save considerable complexity in administration in chasing up and determining for the 2.5 million children who have accounts whether the money came from their parents or from their paper rounds. That is a nugatory pastime where small sums are involved.<br><br>
At present interest rates, the maximum amount that a parent could invest to benefit from the provision would be about £700. A sum that would produce more than £100 does not give rise to tax only on the excess above £100 but on the total income, so, far from it being of benefit to rich parents who endow their children with large sums, it is of benefit only to parents who endow their children with modest sums. Less than £1,000 is reasonably modest: indeed, in the context of the Government's raising the community charge benefit capital savings limit to £16,000, the Leader of the Opposition said that £16,000 was scarcely a prince's ransom. The new limit of £100 is only one sixteenth of what is less than a prince's ransom.<br><br>
The abolition of composite rate tax is designed to help those who are below the tax threshold and is so geared towards those whom the hon. Member for Makerfield wishes to help. I hope that he will recognise that, within that general purpose, it is sensible to have a de minimis provision that prevents us from cracking down on children's pocket money in an onerous and intrusive way.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West as always made a number of good points. He referred to the difficulties faced by the British Bankers' Association with the proposed method of dealing with certificates of tax deduction. A person in receipt of a payment from which income tax has been deducted is entitled to know the amount of that deduction. No doubt many people will be able to refer to a formula to make the necessary calculation, but it would be unreasonable to expect some elderly and unsophisticated people to do so. Errors would abound, and many people would ask their tax office to do the calculation for them. That would increase the cost of the abolition of composite rate taxation considerably. We see no merit in that, nor do we wish to deprive people of the right to know how much income tax has been deducted from their income. Composite rate tax was different. It was a tax on interest at the institutional level. It was not a tax on an individual's income.<br><br>
My hon. Friend also asked about mandatory payment of gross interests. It is essential that non-taxpayers should be able to self-certify on all the accounts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
that they hold. The objective would be defeated if non-taxpayers with, say, two accounts could certify only on one, and had to rely on a repayment of interest for th other rather than switching accounts. However, we appreciate the banks' problems, and suggest that they hold further discussions with the Revenue with a view to maintaining the mandatory rule but with a let-out restricted to a minimum number of dormant accounts in existence at 6 April 1991. Dormant accounts cause few problems to anybody.<br><br>
My hon. Friend also asked about transitional relief. Tax on interest is chargeable according to tthe date on which interest in paid or credited. In answer to an earlier representation, an assurance was given that that rule would be maintained. The non-liable will be able to receive any gross interest that is paid or credited on or after 6 April 1991. Clearly, there cannot be a non-accruals basis for gross interest and an accruals basis for net interest. In the case of fixed net interest payable in future years, the banks must make commercial judgments about future interest and tax rates. For accounts opened before this year's Budget, estimates of composite rate tax in 1991–92 could not have been made, as such calculations would have depended largely on the 1991 basic rate. For accounts opened subsequently, it has been know that the change to basic rate would be made. In addition, I understand that the banks did not increase contractual net interest rates payable to depositors to reflect the successive reductions in composite rate, from 25.25 per cent. in 1986–87 to 21.75 per cent. in 1989-90. It is a little rich to call for special arrangements when events are moving in the opposite direction.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) welcomed the abolition of composite rate tax but sullied his welcome by saying that it has taken the Government 10 years to get around to it. That was an understatement. It has taken 100 years. The present Government have not been in power throughout that period, but doubtless we shall be for the next century. The composite rate was introduced about a century ago for building society accounts, and has always been accepted, by Governments of all parties and complexions, as an efficient mechanism for collecting money. However, looking at it again in the light of independent taxation, it had to go, and go it will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the complex technical arguments that will have been advanced to my hon. Friend as to other Governments and Treasury teams in the past, against the abolition of this pernicious tax, will he accept that it is a great achievement to have got rid of it at last?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am alway happy to accept praise from any quarter, but the Inland Revenue, which has responded admirably to this tremendous task, deserves it far more than me. It is setting about the task willingly, as are the banks and building socieities. They will have to put in a great deal of work and effort, which we were spared when composite rate tax existed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East gave an impressive display of erudition and understanding of the Bill and the schedule—he always does. He raised an array of questions, some of which I shall

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
endeavour to answer now. I shall respond to the others by correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah! By correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not like it to be said that I have limited my correspondence to one member off the Opposition Front Bench team. I scatter it around pretty widely.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman metioned problems with TESSA and save-as-you-earn plans and the apparent disparity with composite rate taxation. The hon. Gentleman hit a bull's eye. There are errors in the TESSA and save-as-you-earn plans and we shall introduce amendments on Report, so it is one up to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned time deposits. Time deposits pay gross provided that they have a minimum life of nil and a maximum life of five years. Banks are being brought into line with building societies.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked why the board's powers on information were to be increased with immediate effect when the remainder of the proposed legislation would take effect in one year's time. The board's powers will apply only when the basic rate deduction starts on 6 April 1991. I am not sure what power the hon. Gentleman was referring to. Perhaps he would like to write to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman now that the clause is specially worded to leave out subsections (4) and (5) which refer to the Revenue's powers. All the other subsections have effect from 1991 but, by being specifically excluded, subsections (4) and (5) have immediate effect. There must be some reason for that. Is it to do with current investigations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall look closely to see whether the Bill can be construed in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be construed in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One never knows. I have always found that lawyers can construe matters differently from the way I would construe them. The hon. Gentleman raised a question about the trustee savings banks and the Scottish savings banks. I hope that I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest, by saying that they are authorised institutions and included in the scheme.<br><br>
It would probably be better for me to respond in writing to the hon. Gentleman and any other members of the Committee who wish to be illuminated, on other questions.</span></p>

PRIORITY SHARE ALLOCATIONS FOR EMPLOYEES ETC</div> <!-- title -->
<p>".—(1) In section 68 of the Finance Act 1988 (which provides for the benefits derived from priority rights in share offers to be disregarded in certain circumstances), after subsection (3) there shall be inserted—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) The fact that the allocations of shares in the company to which persons who are not directors or employees of the company are entitled are smaller than those to which directors or employees of the company are entitled shall not be regarded for the purposes or subsection (2)(b) above as meaning that they are not entitled on similar terms if—
<ol>
<li>each of the first-mentioned persons is also entitled, by reason of his office or employment and in priority to members of the public, to an allocation of shares in another company or companies which are offered to the public (at a fixed price or by tender) at the same time as the shares in the company, and</li>
<li>in the case of each of those persons the aggregate value (measured by reference to the fixed price or the lowest price successfully tendered) of all the shares included in the allocations to which he is entitled is the same, or as nearly the same as is reasonably practicable, as that of the shares in the company included in the entitlement of a comparable director or employee of the company.'</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p>(2) This section applies to offers made on or after the day on which this Act is passed.".—[Mr. Lilley']</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The purpose of the new clause is to extend the exemption from tax introduced in 1988 to provide that directors and employees given priority rights in a public offer of shares are not liable to income tax on the benefit that can arise provided certain conditions are met.<br><br>
The new clause deals with the circumstances in which directors and employees are entitled, by reason of their office or employment, to share allocations in two or more companies whose shares are offered for sale at the same time. When two or more such companies jointly own another company they may decide to reward and encourage the employees of that subsidiary by offering them priority rights of shares in the owning companies. In such circumstances the employees might be offered fewer priority shares in any one company than are offered to the directors of that company.<br><br>
The "similar terms' rule in the existing legislation does not cater for that possibility. In requires all employees entitled to a priority allocation of shares in a particular company to be entitled to those shares on similar terms. It does not permit priority rights to shares in other companies to be taken into account in establishing whether the 'similar terms' requirement is met.<br><br>
The proposed change will therefore alter the "similar terms" rule to allow such mixed priority rights to be taken into account. As a result, the exemption will be available when some persons are entitled to a smaller

allocation of shares in each of two or more companies that are offered to the public at the same time, but the exemption will still be subject to the "similar terms" rule and that will be regarded as being satisfied only when the aggregate value of the priority allocation of shares offered to such an employee is the same, or as nearly the same as is reasonably practicable, as the value of the entitlement of a comparable employee of any of the offered companies.<br><br>
We should provide for the general circumstances that would include the specific position of companies such as the National Grid Company and Electricity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
Associated Services Ltd., which are jointly owned by the distribution companies and able to give the same terms in substance to employees of those subsidiaries that are available to the distribution companies, without discriminating against them.

DONATIONS TO CHARITY BY INDIVIDUALS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) For the purposes of this section, a gift to a charity by an individual ("the donor") is a qualifying donation if—
<ol>
<li>it is made on or after 1st October 1990,</li>
<li>it satisfies the requirements of subsection (2) below, and</li>
<li>the donor gives an appropriate certificate in relation to it to the charity.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(2) A gift satisfies the requirements of this subsection if—
<ol>
<li>it takes the form of a payment;</li>
<li>it is not subject to a condition as to repayment;</li>
<li>it is not a covenanted payment to charity;</li>
<li>it does not constitute a sum falling with section 202(2) of the Taxes Act 1988 (payroll deduction scheme);</li>
<li>neither the donor nor any person connected with him receives a benefit in consequence of making it;</li>
<li>it is not conditional on or associated with, or part of an arrangement involving, the acquisition of property by the charity, otherwise than by way of gift, from the donor or a person connected with him;</li>
<li>the sum paid is not less than £600;</li>
<li>the sum paid does not, when aggregated with any other qualifying donations already made by the donor in the relevant year of assessment, exceed £5,000,000; and</li>
<li>the donor is resident in the United Kingdom at the time the gift is made.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(3) The reference in subsection (l)(c) above to an appropriate certificate is a reference to a certificate which is in such form as the Board may prescribe and contains statements to the following effect—
<ol>
<li>that the gift satisfies the requirements of subsection (2) above, and</li>
<li>that, either directly or by deduction from profits or gains brought into charge to tax in the relevant year of assessment, the donor has paid or will pay to the Board income tax of an amount equal to income tax at the basic rate for the relevant year of assessment on the grossed up amount of the gift.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(4) Where a gift is a qualifying donation, the Income Tax Acts, except Part IX of the Taxes Act 1988 (annual payments), shall have effect, in their application to the donor, as if the making of the gift were the making of a covenanted payment to charity of an amount equal to the grossed up amount of the gift, being a payment falling to be made at the time the gift is made.</p>
<p>(5) Where the payment which the donor is treated by virtue of subsection (4) above as making would, if in fact made, be payable wholly or partly out of profits or gains brought into charge to income tax, they shall be assessed and charged with income tax on the donor without distinguishing the payment and shall be so assessed and charged at the appropriate rate.</p>
<p>(6) Where the payment which the donor is treated by virtue of subsection (4) above as making would, if in fact made, not be payable or not be wholly payable out of profits or gains brought into charge to income tax, the donor shall be assessable and chargeable with income tax at the appropriate rate on the payment, or on so much of it as would not be payable out of profits or gains brought into charge to income tax.</p>
<p>(7) For the purposes of subsections (5) and (6) above the appropriate rate is the basic rate for the year of assessment in which, in accordance with subsection (4) above, the payment falls to be made.</p>
<p>(8) The receipt by a charity of a gift which is a qualifying donation shall be treated for the purposes of the Tax Acts, in their application to the charity, as the receipt, under deduction of income tax at the basic rate for the relevant year of assessment, of an annual payment of an amount equal to the grossed up amount of the gift.</p>
<p>(9) Section 839 of the Taxes Act 1988 applies for the purposes of subsection (2) above.</p>
<p>(10) For the purposes of this section—
<ol>
<li>"charity" has the same meaning as in section 506 of the Taxes Act 1988 and includes each of the bodies mentioned in section 507 of that Act;</li>

<li>"covenanted payment to charity" has the meaning given by section 660(3) of the Taxes Act 1988;</li>
<li>"relevant year of assessment", in relation to a gift, means the year of assessment in which the gift is made;</li>
<li>references, in relation to a gift, to the grossed up amount are to the amount which after deducting income tax at the basic rate for the relevant year of assessment leaves the amount of the gift; and</li>

<p>Government new clause 43—<i>Donations to charity: inspection powers—</i></p>
<p>and Government amendments Nos. 242 and 243.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clause 40 would, with new clauses 41 to 43, give effect to the Budget proposal of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to introduce gift aid—a new tax relief for large cash donations made to charity on or after 1 October of this year. The proposal has been widely welcomed by charities. For example, Save the Children Fund said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is something we have been wanting for many years. We totally welcome the Chancellor's announcement".</p></blockquote>
The Charities Aid foundation said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is the best ever [Budget for Charities] by any Government".</p></blockquote>
The Government's record on helping charities is excellent. In 1988–89 Government grants to the voluntary sector—including charities—exceeded £2 billion. Since we came to office in 1979, we have improved tax reliefs dramatically. We introduced payroll giving, we have made the relief on deeds of covenant more generous and more flexible, we have extended the VAT
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
reliefs available to charities, we have introduced relief for companies' donations and now we are introducing gift aid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend feel that it is sad that fewer than 50 Members of Parliament take advantage of payroll giving?</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I accept entirely my hon. Friend's observation.<br><br>
We have done something for charities or charitable giving in nearly every Budget since 1980. I do not think that it is any coincidence that charitable giving by individuals has doubled in real terms over the past decade. In total, the tax reliefs for charities and charitable giving are now worth some £700 million a year.<br><br>
When he announced gift aid in his Budget speech my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that it was not practical to operate relief for all small one-off gifts; and in any event he did not want to undermine regular giving through covenants and payroll—giving schemes. For these reasons, and to encourage larger gifts to charity, gift aid will be available for single gifts of at least £600. There will be a maximum limit of £5 million a year for gifts by any one donor.<br><br>
Gifts under the scheme will be made net of basic rate tax, and the charity will be able to claim a tax repayment from the Inland Revenue. For example, if an individual donor gives a charity the minimum amount of £600, it will be able to claim a tax repayment of £200–25 per cent on the gross amount of £800. Thus £600 from the donor will be worth £800 to the charity. That is a major contribution from the Government through their Finance Bill.<br><br>
The donor will also give the charity a certificate on which he will declare that the gift meets the requirements and that he has paid, or will pay, £200 basic rate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
tax. Normally, that will be tax he has already paid on his income. In that case he will not need to pay more. Where the donor is a higher rate taxpayer, he can also claim higher rate relief on £800.<br><br>
New clauses 41 and 42 extend the relief to company donations. For close companies, they give relief for the first time. Limits on the relief will be the same as for individuals. For companies which are not close, existing relief for donations up to the equivalent for 3 per cent of dividends will continue; but the £5 million upper limit will be available instead when it is more favourable to the company. Where the donor is a company, it will deduct basic rate tax from the gift and pay it over to the Revenue in the usual way. The charity will be able to claim repayment of the tax, and the company will get corporation tax relief against its profits.<br><br>
New clause 43 empowers the Inland Revenue to inspect charities' records of donations for which they have claimed tax repayments under the scheme. That will help the Revenue to check that charities' tax repayment claims are correct and help them to ensure that their arrangements meet the requirements of the scheme.<br><br>
The Government are playing their part in providing generous tax reliefs. The clauses extend the range of reliefs available for different forms of charitable giving. I hope that donors and charities will now make full use of these opportunities, and I commend the new clauses to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Making provision for donations to charity is no substitute for the provision of good public services paid for through taxation to meet all the real needs of the disadvantaged. The Government have moved from providing public services to encouraging charitable giving. But that has not been a success, and it has not even struck a chord amongst the most wealthy despite the Government's great efforts to offer them concessions and blandishments to encourage charitable giving. By and large, wealthy people who have accumulated money through dramatic increases in their salaries, favourable tax treatment and other means have preferred to keep it rather than give it to charity.<br><br>
However, it should not be thought that the Opposition are opposed to charity, because we are not. Our argument is simply that charity is no substitute, as I said, for high quality public services to meet real needs.<br><br>
I shall take up various arguments arising out of the Economic Secretary's statement on the new clauses. The first goes over the old territory of tax avoidance. New clause 40(2) (a) refers to a gift taking
<br><blockquote><p>"the form of a payment".</p></blockquote>
I understand that to mean that the gift must be in cash, not in kind, but I hope that the Economic Secretary will correct me if I am wrong. There have been some well publicised scandals in the United States, in which donor and recipient have co-operated in frauds against the Revenue. The Government may be trying to prevent similar scandals in this country. That is understandable, and we support them, but relief on a debt, such as when a loan to a charity is released, should not be classified as a payment. Also, what hap-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
pens when a donor wants to give a valuable asset to charity? A person might want to give an inherited painting to a museum that has charitable status, so that it would form part of its assets an could be cared for in perpetuity. The donor would be able to claim relief from tax on the capital gain under section 6 of the Capital Gains tax Act 1979, but would not be able to get relief under new clause 40.<br><br>
The spirit of new clause 40 is that the donor should have that relief, at least on what is given to the charity. Much depends on the interpretation of the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"takes the form of a payment".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will clarify what is intended by that phrase, and how wide the Revenue's powers of interpretation of it will be.<br><br>
New clause 40(2) sets out a number of conditions relating to gifts. It states that repayment of a gift may not be subject to conditions, that neither the donor nor any connected person may receive any benefit from making the payment, and that a gift must not be associated with the acquisition of any property from the donor or from anyone connected with him, otherwise than by way of gift. Those conditions seem very sensible, and are intended a measures against tax avoidance. I assume that the Government are aware of the possibility of abuse, given the spectacular St. George's theatre trust case not so long ago. The Government are of course right to tighten anti-avoidance regulations, but they should not make claiming the relief difficult, if not impossible.<br><br>
The Government must also make provision for circumstances in which relief is claimed and a repayment made later. One could imagine that the charity should be taxed on such a gift, but in practice that liability would be hard to enforce. Subsection (2)(b) is too narrow, in that it refers only to a gift that is
<br><blockquote><p>"not subject to a condition as to repayment".</p></blockquote>
It does not cover a repayment that was not a stated condition of the gift. Informal arrangements can always be made. How are such potential abuses to be stopped? Our amendment (d) would remedy the problem by allowing relief to be withdrawn retrospectively where the rules have not been observed.<br><br>
Subsection (1)(e) is too wide, as immaterial benefits would disqualify relief completely. Our amendments (a) and (e) would limit subsection (l)(e) to material benefits of less than 5 per cent. of the value of the gift, and tax the amount of immaterial benefit received. The amendments are minor, tidying-up measures.<br><br>
Amendment (b) deals with a more significant, though rather complex, issue. New clause 40(5) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the payment which the donor is treated by virtue of subsection (4) above as making would, if in fact made, be payable wholly or partly out of profits or gains brought into charge to income tax, they shall be assessed and charged with income tax on the donor without distinguishing the payment and shall be so assessed and charged at the appropriate rate."</p></blockquote>
The definition of the appropriate rate is contained in subsection (7) which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of subsections (5) and (6) above the appropriate rate is the basic rate for the year of assessment in which, in accordance with subsection (4) above, the payment falls to be made.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
My reading of that is that subsection (7), qualifying subsection (5), takes in for taxation at the basic rate the entire sum of money—no matter how large that is—involved in subsection (5). That cannot possibly have been the Government's intention. There is a substantial drafting error, which our amendment (b) seeks to correct. However, if the Government find that unacceptable, I urge them to produce their own on Report. Otherwise they will find that they are giving a tax relief far in excess of anything they could have reasonably intended. I believe that it is a drafting error that has arisen by carrying forward standard wordings, without qualifying them precisely.<br><br>
I should also like to raise the issue of new clause 10, which defines charity as meaning only registered charities as in section 506, plus heritage bodies in section 507. However, in other places it often includes bodies mentioned in section 508 of the Taxes Act 1988, such as scientific research organisations, indeed, new clause 43 so defines charities. It is unhelpful to have different definitions of charities in different parts of the Bill. I wonder whether there is a specific reason for that, or whether it has come about in haste.<br><br>
Since those issues might become contentious in future, it would be helpful if the Government chose one definition and stuck to it, rather than leaving room for argument and ambiguity, as at present.<br><br>
My final point is contained in amendments (h) and (i) which seek to deal with the issue of the £5 million top threshold. The Government have set the threshold in such a way as to make it highly unlikely ever to be reached except in rare circumstances where the sum is spread across groups of companies. The current requirement is for the £5 million to be divided evenly across the group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. The hon. Gentleman referred to amendments (h) and (i), which I cannot find on the amendment paper. Perhaps I am looking at the wrong page.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am confused as well, because the amendments to new clause 40 do not go beyond (g) on my amendment paper.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reference on my notes is obviously wrong, for which I apologise. I am referring to new clause 42(3) which sets out the distribution of the reliefs across groups of companies. The reliefs should be available across the group, rather than being divided between individual companies in the group.<br><br>
I take very seriously the drafting point in new clause 40(5) and the way that it is qualified by subsection (7). The Exchequer could be giving away substantial sums because of that. In considering all the points, will the Economic Secretary give that particular point comprehensive consideration and respond to it on Report, if not now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) made a thorough analysis of the points raised in the new clause and the constructive amendments to it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
I should like to mention the threshold at the other end of the scale—the lower amount of £600. Gifts must be over that sum in value before they qualify for this benefit. I suspect that the threshold has been set at £600 because that is also the limit for tax relief for payroll giving. If that is so, will the Economic Secretary consider whether there is any logic for such a link? Any future attempt to raise the threshold for payroll giving would presumably lead to an increase in the lower threshold for gift aid. That could in turn lead to the loss of gifts which would otherwise have benefited the recipient charities, as they would have qualified for a pay-back. There appears to be no logic in such a link. Even if the Economic Secretary feels obliged to stick with the threshold for payroll relief this year, will he consider raising it in another year and maintaining the level for gift aid?<br><br>
I understand that some charities wish for a lower threshold of £200. There must be a balance between the administrative costs and the benefit. However, another factor is involved. A person may wish to spread a sum of money around a number of charities. To some charities, £200 or £300 would be of considerable benefit. Does the £600 have to go to just one charity? What would happen if someone with £2,000 to donate wished to give four charities £500 each? It would be regrettable if that person did not qualify for the benefit which the new clause confers. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would answer that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) rightly observed that we chose the £600 limit because we wanted to protect the measures that we had already taken to enhance charitable giving. With a lower limit, we would not have been able to give those other measures the necessary commitment and encouragement.<br><br>
As for having a look at the figure in future Budgets, I would not wish to tie the hands of my right hon. Friends the Chancellor, but it is inconceivable that future representations will not be made to my right hon. Friend the hon. Gentleman and by charities to change the ceilings set out. My right hon. Friend and other Treasury Ministers have had meetings with charitable bodies to discuss these general matters. Such a meeting took place ealier this year. As I said earlier, the charities were pleased with the Treasury's conclusions and with my right hon. Friend's announcement in his Budget speech on 20 March. I recognise that there will be pressures in future years and we shall certainly take them into account. However, the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I do not wish to make a firm commitment now.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) asked us to take a comprehensive look at the drafting. As he knows, the new clause was tabled only recently. I am not suggesting that the drafting is perfect and I should not wish to go from the Committee without giving the hon Gentleman a commitment to consider the drafting before Report in the light of his comments. I am grateful to him for his observations.<br><br>
The Revenue will publish guidance for donors and charities on the administrative arrangements once the legislation has been enacted. It comes into force on 1
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
October. however, a full and helpful press release was issued by the Revenue on 20 March when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made his Budget statement to the House. It runs to several pages and until the Revenue publishes more precise guidance, I commend it to people who are considering becoming donors.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East understandably raised the question whether a donation must be a gift and not a loan. it certainly must be money; it cannot be gifts in kind. Recently, requests have been made for that to be allowed. As someone who is extremely observant about the need to protect the Inland Revenue, he will understand that gifts in kind, such as works of art, are extremely difficult to value. Valuations can be subjective. One heed only look at the prices that are suggested at any Sotheby's or Christie's or Phillips auctions to see how far out on the final bid price the experts can be. For that reason, it is only right that the Government should stick to their present plans and should not permit works of art to be included for the purpose of gift aid. The measure must be drawn as tightly as possible.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised other points connected with the amendments that he tabled. I want to give him as full a reply as possible, but I shall try not to take too long. Amendments (a) and (e) to new clause 40 are concerned with cases where the donor receives some benefit in return for his donation. I understand the thinking behind the amendments, but they would introduce a new element of undue complexity, which would detract from this very simple scheme. One of its great merits is that those who wish to give to charity can do so, because they understand the scheme. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor is determined that the scheme should be kept as simple as possible, so I cannot accept the amendment.<br><br>
New clause 40, under which donors must get no benefit in return for their gifts, is clear and unambiguous. If donors want to make separate arrangements with charities to pay for goods and services supplied by a charity, they are free to do so, but they should keep such arrangements apart from their gift aid gifts. If they do not, complications may be introduced into an otherwise straightforward scheme.<br><br>
Amendment (b) is concerned with the higher rate relief for charitable donations that qualify under the gift aid scheme. It is unnecessary because the new clause should achieve precisely the same result, but if it does not, I shal be pleased to look at the drafting again. However, my initial advice is that the matter has been taken care of in the new clause. The amendment would alter subsection (5), the purpose of which is to ensure that the donor remains chargeable to basic rate on an equivalent slice of his income. That means the tax that the Revenue will repay to the charity; if it were repaid to the donor, the right result would not be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rather thought that that would be the Government's intention, but that is not what will happen under subsection (5), which is qualified by subsection (7). Subsection (7) says that
<br><blockquote><p>"the appropriate rate is the basic rate",</p></blockquote>
but its application in subsection (5) is not as narrowly defined as the Economic Secretary said. Its scope is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
much wider and, on a strict reading of the new clause, is applied to "the payment". That is what "they" refers to after "income tax," in line 38. It is defined as the amount that is payable
<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or partly out of profits or gains brought into charge to income tax".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the whole amount—not just that defined by the Economic Secretary—would be chargeable at the basic rate. That is not right; it should have been taxed at a higher rate of income tax, so a substantial loophole is unintentionally being opened up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The advice that I received is that there is no loophole, intentional or unintentional. However, I shall look at the provision again in the light of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.<br><br>
Amendment (c) deals with the arrangements for tax repayments to charities. The text says that the amendment is.
<br><blockquote><p>"for the avoidance of doubt".</p></blockquote>
However, the amendment would impose a stricter condition than the new clause or the rules for full covenants.<br><br>
I understand that the Opposition are trying to protect the Revenue, but I assure him that the Revenue will be making checks between charities' claims and donors' returns to ensure that the donor pays the appropriate amount of tax. The charity will lose its tax repayment if it uses the income for a non-charitable purpose. The present rules have operated satisfactorily for covenants, as I have shown. We should follow their success by applying those rules to gift aid. I assure the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East that we shall keep the scheme under review. If, at the end of one or two years, it is found that the rules that apply to covenants do not work for gift aid, the Government will amend the legislation.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
Amendment (d) seeks to tackle cases where someone makes a donation and receives some of the money back from a charity. The Opposition believe that, if a gift is made without repayment condition and the charity gives or lends all or part of the money back, there should be a tax charge on the donor to cancel out the relief already given. I sympathise with the amendment, but it is unnecessary because if an individual makes a donation, the charity must use the money for charitable purposes. If it does not, it will lose its tax exemption and will not be entitled to repayment of the basic rate tax on the gift. Paying the money back to the donor, or making a loan that is unlikely to be repaid, would constitute a non-charitable use of resources. Withdrawal of exemption cancels out the basic rate tax relief. Rules in the Taxes Acts provide that higher rate relief would be withdrawn from the donor if the charity forfeited its tax exemption. Subsection (4) applies that rule to gift aid donations by treating them in the same way as covenants.<br><br>
Amendments (f) and (g) would extend gift aid relief to donations by individuals to scientific research organisations and training and enterprise councils. For historical reasons, scientific research organisations have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
special exemption from tax on their income similar to that of charities. When the Government introduced tax relief for single donations by non-close companies to charity in 1986, scientific research organisations were also included. New clause 41 would allow close companies to receive tax relief on donations that they make to scientific research organisations. It is unlikely that individuals would wish to give to organisations that mainly carry out scientific research that is useful to industry. We have received no representations that suggest a need for relief on donations made by individuals.<br><br>
Amendment (g) also deals with TECs. Again, businesses will have an interest in them that individuals are unlikely to share. The relief provided by clause 68 should be sufficient.<br><br>
I have done my best to deal with the amendments tabled by the Opposition. I have given a commitment to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, and thanked him for drawing our attention to what he believes are drafting inadequacies in the new clauses. I hope that he will withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the way in which the Economic Secretary has responded to the points made by the Opposition. Some differences are irreconcilable, but they are not sufficiently important to press to a Division. Howver, we should like to press amendment (b) to a Division, becuase the issue that it tackles and the anomaly created in the new clause are of such significance that we want to underscore our disquiet with a Division. Shall not, however, press the other amendments.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to introduce new clause 59, which fulfils the Chancellor's Budget initiative to help football implement the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor's report on the Hillsborough disaster.<br><br>
The Chancellor proposed to cut the rate of pool betting duty from 40.5 per cent to 40 per cent provided that the revenue forgone by the Government was given to the Football Trust for use in bringing Football League grounds up to the standards of safety and comfort recommended by Lord Justice Taylor.<br><br>
Last month, the Football League, the Football Trust and the pools companies reached agreement that all the money saved by the cut in duty would be used on capital works at the grounds of clubs in the Football League and the Scottish Football League, and at the three national stadiums—Wembley, Hampden Park and Windsor Park. Accordingly, the cut in duty was implemented by administrative action late last month.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Economic Secretary's attention to the fact that Wales is part of the United Kingdom? Wales also has national Stadiums. Will he say a few words about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentelman for raising that matter, especially in view of my nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By happy chance, I deliberately mentioned the three grounds to generate an intervention from the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). As he knows, Wembley in England, Hampden Park in Scotland and Windsor Park in Northern Ireland are used solely for international games, but internatinal football is not played at a specifically designated stadium in Wales. International matches are played either at Wrexham or sometimes at Cardiff. That fact was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
recognised by the football authorities during our negotiations with them.<br><br>
The authorities did not complain about the designation of the three specified grounds. Wales does not have a nationally designated ground, but grounds such as Wrexham, where league football is played will, of course, be able to take advantage of the generous treatment given to football as a result of the Chancellor's announcement. The grounds at Cardiff, Swansea and indeed in the hon. Gentleman's constituency—Wrexham—could all take advantage of that treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the Econmomic Secretary? League football is played at Hampden Park, which is the home of Queen's Park football club, which is in the second Scottish division. The timescale for upgrading Hampden Park would be different from that envisaged in the Taylor report for Premier division Scottish clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are three divisions in Scotland. I have not intended to deny that league football matches are played at Hampden Park. My argument is that Ninian Park was not specifically designated by the football authorities as an international ground. Had it been so designated by the authorities, they woud have pointed that out during the negotiations. During those negotiations, only three grounds were identified for proper designation—Wembley, Hampden Park and Windsor Park.<br><br>
We have cut the duty for an initial period of five years, after which we will review the position. Over that period, the reduction will be worth about £100 million. That will not, of course, replace the funds that the Football Trust already gets. It will therefore be additional to the £75 million from other sources, which it expects to be able to make available to football over the next decade.<br><br>
New clause 60 is consequential on news clause 59. It makes sure that the full benefit of the pool betting duty reduction flows through to football by removing certain income tax, corporation tax and inheritance tax liabilities which would othewise arise. If we had not done that a significant proportion of the money that we were making available through the cut in duty—perhaps up to half of it—would have been clawed back through other taxes. The new clause tackles four distinct aspects which are designed to give football clubs—through the Football Trust—more money to spend on improving the comfort and safety of their grounds.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
Eleventh hour representations have been made to backdate the changes to the beginning of the fiscal year. I regret that such representations were not made during the negotiations between Government officials and the football authorities. The football authorities were badly advised if their adviser did not raise the matter then.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget that the measures would come into effect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
the moment the football authorities reached a firm argeement with the Government, but since then the football authorities have wanted the measure backdated. We have kept our word. Agreement was reached on 23 May and we implemented the cut in duty on 28 May. The Football Trust benefits by over £1 million a month and will continue to benefit until May 1995, when we shall review the matter.<br><br>
I do not want to make an issue about whether the measure should be backdated by a few weeks. I shall consider the representations, although I deeply regret that they were not made before. I shall look for a firm written commitment from the pools promoters that the entire duty reduction from 5 April to 28 May will be passed on to the Football Trust. In the light of other points that may arise during subsequent representations, I may make some changes. However, I do not wish to make a commitment because it depends on what happens in the next few days.<br><br>
I outlined the new clause. I said that I shall consider the matter of backdating but have given no commitments. I hope that the Committee welcome, as have the football authorities, the changes announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in the Budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kate Hoey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vauxhall)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we welcome new clause 59 and the Chancellor's decision to reduce the betting tax, which was increased by a Conservative Government in 1979. Hon. Members who care about football, especially Labour Members, and the football authorities have been calling for the reduction for several years. The Economic Secretary is a football supporter—he supports a good team—and I am pleased that he may have accepted some of the arguments on backdating put by the Football League and other parties.<br><br>
Backdating is the crux of any disagreement that we might have about the technicalities of a measure which we all support because it recognises for the first time that football needs more money. There are arguments about how the Football League and football clubs have spent their money. Nevertheless, there is now recognition of the fact that football is a national game which requires considerable capital investment to improve health and safety and make the clubs more attractive to families and children. It is accepted that the Government should not penalise it through taxation.<br><br>
The Chancellor said that he was going to reduce the pools betting levy on the basis that the difference would be paid into the Football Trust for the implementation of the Taylor recommendations. All of us "who heard" the speech assumed that that would happen from 5 April, the beginning of the new financial year. The football authorities and the Football Trust also believed that that would happen. Prior to the Chancellor's announcement, there had been a longstanding agreement between the pools promoters and the football authorities of England and Scotland and the Irish football leagues whereby the pools companies paid a royalty to the leagues for the use of their fixture lists. The agreement stated that if there was a reduction
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
in the pools betting levy from 42.5 per cent to 40 per cent—or to whatever level—the reduction would be shared out, although not in a way with which I would agree. Three fifths would go to the pools company and two fifths would go to the football leagues.<br><br>
The Chancellor's announcement was clearly at odds with that agreement. For the pools companies to ensure that there would be no adverse consequential effect on their tax position, it was necessary for them to have extensive discussions with the leagues and the Inland Revenue. We all know that discussuions with the Inland Revenue can take a long time. In this case, the discussions were quite speedy; nevertheless, there was a delay and the pools companies recognise that part of it was their fault. They took longer to obtain the necessary authority, and one company took longer than the others to sign the agreement. Therefore, the Economic Secretary is right to say that the agreement was not signed until the end of May.<br><br>
However, it is no fault of football that about £350,000 a week is being lost to the Football Trust. We are talking about six weeks, so it is a substantial amount. With 130 clubs possibly benefiting, if the money were divided out pro rata, it would be equivalent to the amount that might go to two Football League clubs. It will not actually be worked out that way, but that puts the matter into perspective. I think that the Economic Secretary has recognised that the delay is not necessarily football's fault. He said that the football authorities may not have had the right advice. This might be the time the Minister with responsibility for sport—or the Chancellor himself, who I know is very keen on sport and football—to give them back-up advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her observations, but the Government are not obliged to give the authorities more advice than was contained in the press release entitled "Government Help for Football Safety", which was published on 20 March, the day of the Budget. That press release stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Chancellor hopes that agreement on the arrangements for channelling the money into ground improvements will be reached quickly. The cut in duty will be made as soon as possible after that."</p></blockquote>
There could be nothing clearer. If the football authorities had glanced at that release, they could have reached the right conclusions without need of personal advice from my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Hoey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of us are critical of the way in which the Football League is run, but the Minister with responsibility for sport has spent much of the past six months talking to football clubs and the international football authorities. I should have thought that he might have been interested in ensuring that the Football League did not get into this bureaucratic mix-up, whose only victims will be the ordinary people who will have to wait longer for their clubs to be made safe.<br><br>
I am pleased that the Minister will examine the matter again. It is important to get it in writing, but I understand that the pools companies have made the calculations and are happy to make sure that the money will go to the Football Trust.<br><br>
The guidelines given to the Football Trust and the clubs are inflexible and narrow. Obviously, the money
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
should be spent on health and safety given the events that gave rise to the Taylor report. Flexibility would be improved if, as we suggest in amendment (b), the word "capital" were removed, or if, as proposed in amendment (c) the word "repairs" were inserted after it. What constitutes capital is problematic. In some football grounds, rebuilding a new stand or installing safety doors would increase the club's capital assets. But improvements or repairs do not necessarily come under the same classification, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will clarify what is an important distinction. It might be better to omit the word "capital" altogether.<br><br>
I should like a further reduction to be made to the pools betting duty in the future. It is unfair that the pools companies pay back into the Exchequer a higher percentage of the money raised from betting than do other gambling organisations. Money should be directed away from the Exchequer to specific targets in football.<br><br>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will accept the amendment on capital and repairs. He should go back and have a little chat with his boss. I am sure that the Chancellor, when he presented his Budget to the House, believed that the pools betting levy would be reduced from 5 April. No doubt there are ways to backdate it in a simple, unbureaucratic way that will ensure that the money goes towards improving football grounds and making them better and safer places for people to visit on a Saturday afternoon.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Miss Hoey), I welcome new clauses 59 and 60. However, they are not over-generous, given the problems faced by some football clubs.<br><br>
When we hear of football clubs bandying about players for multi-million pound fees, those not closely involved in football think that the game is healthy and that there is plenty of money about. Sometimes the problem is oversimplified and it is suggested that clubs should stop buying and selling players and spend money on ground improvements. That shows a failure to understand the nature of the game, particularly in Scotland and England, where money tends to circulate internally, because our clubs, unlike those in Spain and Italy, do not tend to spend large sums on foreign players. Although some clubs are well-off, they are not in the majority.<br><br>
The figure of £100 million sounds a lot, but we must consider two factors: the money is to be spread over five years and there are 130 league clubs in England and Scotland. If every league club got a proportionate amount, that would mean about £750,000 a club, which would not go far towards the provision of all-seater stadiums.<br><br>
The Taylor report said that first and second division clubs in England and premier division clubs in Scotland—a total of 54 clubs—have to make their grounds all-seater by 1994. I understand that that date was chosen because it accords with FIFA regulations on international grounds. The qualifying matches for the 1994 World cup will be held only in all-seater stadiums,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
so the national stadiums will have to be upgraded before 1994.<br><br>
To upgrade stadiums in first and second division clubs in England and those in the premier division in Scotland will not merely require a great deal of money. Many football grounds date back 100 years and are in heavily built-up areas. It is not always possible to purchase land nearby or to knock down houses and extend grounds and put in grandstands. Many clubs are looking for alternative sites near green belt areas on which to build new stadiums. The £100 million over five years for all those clubs will not go far if they have to build a stadium on a new ground.<br><br>
In my home town of Dundee, the two city football clubs are getting together to build a joint stadium. The quoted cost is between £25 and £30 million. I realise that the £100 million is not meant to help clubs to build new stadiums, but it should be borne in mind that the cost of upgrading stadiums is very high.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall listed her reservations about the timing, so I shall not repeat her arguments. However, I hope that the Economic Secretary will be as good as his word and will agree to backdate so that the £2 million that stands to be forgone is reinstated.<br><br>
New clause 60 would grant tax relief if payments are made
<br><blockquote><p>"in consquence of the reduction in pool betting duty effected by"</p></blockquote>
new clause 59. That restriction could cause problems. Who is to prove that the reason for the payment was the reduction in duty? The payment could be equivalent to twice the reduction in duty. The new clause does not make it clear how the condition must be satisfied. Furthermore, it suggests that pre-enactment, post-Budget expenditure could be intended. It is not possible for expenditure incurred before 19 March 1990 to be treated as made in reliance of the promise in the Budget. The condition should be reworded as amendment (a) to new clause 60 suggests.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall referred to the difference between capital expenditure and money spent on repairs. One aspect of repairs, which is particularly relevant to all-seater stadiums, is that clubs that cannot, or will not, look for a new site but want to upgrade their grounds may have to upgrade existing seats as well as install more seats. The FIFA regulations are specific, and simply providing bench-type seating in a ground is not sufficient. It must be tip-up seating. Surely that would be seen as improving grounds, rather than instituting capital expenditure. That type of expenditure may be excluded in the present legislation, and I cannot believe that that is intended. Surely all contributions to spectator safety should qualify under the new clause.<br><br>
In the debate in January on safety at football grounds the Home Secretary stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"a change in the tax, which would undoubtedly benefit the promoters would not necessarily benefit football.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 January 1990, vol. 166 c. 233.]</p></blockquote>
Either there was a conversion between January and March, possibly as a result of the publication of the Taylor report, or there is some dispute within the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0266">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
Government about what should be done for football. Evidence has emerged on several occasions to show that certainly the Prime Minister and possibly the Minister with responsibility for sport are not particularly disposed towards football. The figure of £100 million for ground safety improvements compares poorly with state funding in Italy for the World cup, amounting to £3 billion. Many of those stadiums are used only two or three times during the World cup. However, the benefits to the communities in those Italian cities—not just clubs—remains long after, because many of the grounds are municipally owned.<br><br>
The Government do not realise that there is a benefit in having stadiums available for communities and that it is appropriate to have significant state funding. Italy is not the only country that is doing that. France, which held the European championship in 1984, Mexico, the centre for the World cup in 1986, and Sweden, which is gearing up for the 1992 European championship are all ploughing significant amounts of money into improving ground safety, on the basis that the Government have a responsibility. Although new clauses 59 and 60 are welcome—apart from those reservations about the amendments—the Government can and should do more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the new clauses, but I agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) that they must be seen in the context of the vast amount of work to be done. The Economic Secretary asked about the football grounds in my constituency. My constituency does not have teams in any of the Scottish leagues. However, I should declare an interest—since the age of 13, I have held five shares in Glasgow Rangers football club, which may damn me in some eyes. I am not sure of the pecuniary advantage of the new clauses to me, as I do not think I have been paid a dividend in the past few years.<br><br>
What Rangers has done in making Ibrox stadium all-seater is welcome. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) pointed out in the January debate on football ground safety, Rangers is associated with a financial company with many interests, and that has undoubtedly been helpful in raising finance for the striking improvements that have been made.<br><br>
The other Scottish club that has made great strides in creating an all-seater stadium, St. Johnstone, has been able to do so because a supermarket retail company wishes to develop the site of the existing ground and help develop as part of the package a new stadium for the team on new ground donated for the purpose.<br><br>
Not every club in the four divisions in England, or in any of the Scottish divisions can take advantage of deals like that. As the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Miss Hoey) said, we are looking forward to a time when people will again feel relaxed about taking their families to football matches. Undoubtedly, all-seater stadiums will contribute a great deal towards that.<br><br>
It would be helpful if the Government were prepared to backdate the very modest extra sum of £2 million. I understand that the Economic Secretary feels that he is being very reasonable in implementing an undertaking almost as soon as possible. But if there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
is no reason of principle why that sum should not be backdated to the beginning of the tax year, I hope that the Minister will seriously consider the representations made to him.<br><br>
I understand from the Football Trust that, over the coming year, it expects to have problems with planning consent as well as money problems. Planning consent is outwith a Finance Bill, but is very important in terms of the money available being spent. Can the Economic Secretary assure us that his hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for sport will ensure that other barriers will not be put in the way of this tax concession and that it will be used to improve sports grounds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest as chairman of the rugby league group in Parliament. I shall be making a plea about the failure to take account of the need to provide resources to assist the rugby league authorities to implement the changes that the Taylor report requires.<br><br>
I support the comments of my hon. Friends and welcome, albeit with some reservations, the Government's proposals to put further resources into stadium safety in the Scottish, Welsh and English divisions. I do so for two reasons: two of my school friends were killed in the Ibrox disaster, along with the only son of my mother's best friend at work, who died only days after his father. I also lost two constituents as the Hillsborough disaster. From a personal and constituency point of view, football stadium disasters have come very close to my life.<br><br>
Everything that has been said in debate in the House and outside must be taken on board by the football authorities. I do not go regularly to football matches, although I am a supporter. Much of the criticism that has been levied as an excuse not to put resources into football has been due largely to the mismanagement of football by the authorities and those in charge of clubs. It has been decades since the disaster at Ibrox and during that time as my hon. Friends have said, much money has been wasted which could have been used to provide better and safer stadiums for the public.<br><br>
The situation is different in rugby league. The game is expanding in geographic terms and the average attendance at the premier division last year was higher for the bigger clubs than the average attendance at football matches. The average attendance at football matches was 8,000 to 9,000, while in the large rugby league clubs it was 12,000 to 14,000. Young families, women and school children are coming in increasing numbers to outmoded and ageing grounds.<br><br>
Nothing in the Bill and nothing that has been said by the Minister with responsibility for sport tackles the issue of upgrading grounds for growing family sports such as rugby, which have no history of violence. Nevertheless, the large rugby grounds still need to maintain the same standards as football grounds. They have the same charges for policing arrangements and the same need to upgrade and develop the grounds so that those who go to rugby matches have the same provision and quality of facilities as those who go to football stadiums.<br><br>
It is important that the Government consider investing in sports stadiums in Great Britain. In future, rugby
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
and football bodies will probably invest together in new stadiums which could be used not just at weekends but during the week by the community for many other sports. Resources must be found to pursue such a principle. That still leaves my sport of rugby league in a poor position compared with other spectator sports such as football. Will the Minister assure me that in the next financial year, meetings will take place between the official bodies in rugby and officials in the Treasury and the Department of the Environment to consider how to provide the resources to implement for rugby league the Taylor proposals on improving ground safety?<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
The numbers of people who want to watch rugby league is growing. That increasing number often has to use rugby stadiums that are in a poorer condition than many of the footbhall stadiums that will receive substantial resources for upgrading. Successful clubs such as those in Wigan, Hull and Leeds, which put thousands of pounds of their own resources into improving stadiums, should not be put at a disadvantage compared with the large football clubs in the north-west with which rugby league has to compete for spectators. Rugby league is financed mainly by people going through the turnstiles. Increasing amounts are being provided by sponsorship, but the sport relies on money taken at the turnstiles. It does not have the same resources from pools, radio, or television sponsorship, although they are improving.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can give a commitment to having a series of discussions with rugby league—and even with rugby union, cricket and othe spectator sports—about devising a scheme for improving all sports stadiums and not just those related to football.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the new clause and everything that the Economic Secretary said. I welcome his words about help for the international grounds in Wales, including that at Wrexham. It may be churlish of me, but I take issue with him on one matter. He said that the initiative came from the Home Secretary, but in the debate on football gounds in January, my right hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Spark-brook (Mr. Hattersley) and for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Howell) proposed such a scheme.<br><br>
The new clause is a product of both sides of the House recognising the problem of the state of football grounds. I pay tribute to the Government for acting on that recognition. The Opposition tabled some amendments. I want to make progress and we do not want to be here too long this evening. I hope that the Economic Secretary will listen to me and, rather than give detailed replies now, perhaps he can take the appropriate action on Report if the amendments commend themselves to him.<br><br>
This debate crosses the political divide and I know that the Minister will consider the matter impartially. If the amendments do not commend themselves to him, there must be good reason.<br><br>
Government new clause 60 gives tax relief only if payment is made
<br><blockquote><p>"in consequence of the reduction in pool betting duty effected by"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
new clause 59. That may present some difficulties, but I hope that none arise as a result of interpreting that line.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary should accept amendment (a) to new clause 60. The wording may be designed to allow re-enactment, post-Budget expenditure, which is strengthened by the words;
<br><blockquote><p>"including a payment made before the passing of this Act"</p></blockquote>
but no pre-19 March expenditure can be said to be made according to the Budget's policies and the condition could be reworded for any payment to be made on or after 19 March. Amendment (a) seeks to do that.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Miss Hoey) mentioned amendment (c). It is difficult to interpret the word "capital". What happens when a new roof—which is clearly capital—is put on a stand and there is an element of betterment in the operation? Will there be problems if a club puts on a new roof as part of its renovations? Amendments (b) and (c) to new clause 60 would avoid any such problems. Amendment (b) is slightly stronger than (c), but either should be considered.<br><br>
Amendment (d) is a probing amendment to find out what is meant by a qualifying expenditure. Will there be problems if part of an expenditure is qualifying and another part is not? Our amendment (f) would deal with any problems.<br><br>
Amendments (g) and (e) are also important. If the Economic Secretary would assure me that he understands their purpose and will consider them that will save the Committee time as I shall not have to explain them. I am sure that new clause 60 will be accepted without opposition.<br><br>
Everything is not administratively perfect in the world of football. Representations have been made for backdating the payment to the beginning of April and I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for saying that he will do his best to make that possible. I commend the new clauses to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) for his support of the new clauses. The hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) apologised to me that he had to leave to catch a train and the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) telephoned me today to discuss the new clauses. He would have liked to have taken part in the debate, but is unable to do so because he is part of an important 11-person delegation on pressing parliamentary business in the Netherlands.<br><br>
I hope to respond briefly. I reiterate that the Government made it clear that the cut in pool betting duty would be made when negotiations were completed, but I agreed to consider backdating. The Government's position was made clear in a press release which I quoted in an intervention on the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Miss Hoey). I know that the hon. Lady is very interested in matters in the House that pertain to sport. Like her, I am a great football supporter, which is all the more reason for me to commend the two new clauses to the Committee. The hon. Lady recognises that we kept our word on the dates. However, we must examine the matter again.<br><br>
Some hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Makerfield and for Vauxhall want us to give other

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
sports tax relief. I recall the hon. Lady's speech on the third or fourth day of the Budget debate, when she said that cricket should receive tax relief. Perhaps the Oval is in her constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Hoey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Oval is in my constituency. I suggested, during the Budget debate, that designated cricket grounds should not pay VAT.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Lady that we considered other sports carefully especially mass spectator sports, although I am not sure whether watching cricket at the Oval on a wet June day constitutes a mass spectator sport. The other sports included cricket, rugby league and rugby union, but we decided that association football required special measures.<br><br>
Hillsborough was a soccer tragedy and Lord Justice Taylor's report focused on soccer. He indentified conditions at football grounds as contributory factors to hooliganism. Our national sport still suffers from that problem. It was right for the Government to respond positively to the Taylor recommendations and to express tangibly our desire to ensure that they are implemented quickly.<br><br>
Pool betting duty arises from betting on football, not on rugby league—the hon. Member for Makerfield represents Wigan—or any other sport. Football should receive the proceeds of football pools. Hon. Members have asked about tax relief on sports clubs' expenditure to improve their grounds. Existing tax legislation provides generous tax relief for that. Relief is available for any improvement needed for the club to qualify for a safety certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. Relief is available for capital expenditure on various fixtures and fittings, including seating, floodlights, turnstile machinery and repairs. Relief is not available for capital expenditure on commercial buildings and structures such as stands. We considered giving more generous relief for expenditure on football ground improvements, but such relief is useful only to taxpayers, and few football clubs pay tax. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) also made that point. We decided to cut the pool betting duty instead.<br><br>
I am not convinced that we should give increased or new relief for capital expenditure on the cost of building new stands. Most commercial buildings do not depreciate in the short to medium term. It would also be difficult to limit such allowances to sport.<br><br>
Some hon. Members said that Italy has a more generous attitude towards football. Any country that hosts the world cup spends a great deal of money on improving grounds. Before the 1966 world cup in England some grounds were improved. Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday's ground, was one of them. It was one of the grounds on which 1966 world cup matches—certainly in the earlier stages—were played.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Hoey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Economic Secretary accept that British sport is taxed more highly than in any other European country?</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the precise figures. How-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
ever, I can tell the hon. Lady that no other country has a Football League as large as ours. Nowhere else in my experience do footballers play so much football. If market principles were to operate more widely, fewer football clubs would exist in this country. Several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central, have already alluded to that and suggested that some of the money that should be used for ground improvements gets spent on transfer fees.<br><br>
I do not wish to single out Glasgow, but I know of no other club in the British Isles that has spent as much money on the transfer market as Glasgow Rangers under Mr. Souness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Watson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear that Glasgow Rangers is not my club. However, that was not my point. I was arguing that money spent on transfers cannot simply be put into a fund and used for ground improvements. Top clubs are expecially required to be competitive, and that means spending money on transferring and buying new players and offloading players that are no longer suitable.<br><br>
Money for improving grounds comes from a different source. And it should not be forgotten that clubs still put quite a lot of their own money into ground improvement. I am not confusing the two issues as the Economic Secretary seemed to suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: accept the hon. Gentleman's intervention. In other countries, however, there is far more ground sharing—in Milan or Turin, for example. In this country, only one or two clubs in south London share grounds. More ground sharing would improve the quality, safety and comfort of our football stadiums.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems that can arise is illustrated by our experience in Wrexham and Chester, when Chester's grounds were sold. Policing costs, extra costs and police advice against Chester sharing Wrexham's ground were among the main difficulties. Ground sharing should be encouraged, but we should not underestimate the financial and other difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most football grounds are located in town and city centres. Surely the advantages of ground sharing far outweigh the disadvantages. One factor preventing more ground sharing is the subsidy system. Money goes into football from television and some of the less well-off clubs are effectively subsidised. Normal market principles cannot operate for third and fourth, and even some second division clubs.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central complained that the Government were not providing enough money; but the £100 million from pool betting duty will be in addition to the £75 million that the Football Trust will gain from spot-the-ball competitions over the next 10 years. Football must also help itself. The hon. Gentleman was also worried about tip-up seats and capital expenditure. Yes, tip-up seats would count as capital expenditure and would be eligible for relief.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Vauxhall asked about restrictions on capital to the Football Trust. Of course, it is only allowed to make capital payments. She also asked
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0269">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
about repairs. As I said, the Government do not want the money wasted. There is plenty of scope for spending on ground improvements of a capital nature—new stands, installation of seating, loud speaker systems and so forth.<br><br>
Before I deal with the amendments, I shall refer to the speech of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace). I shall write to him about the matter that he raised. The five shares that he owns in Glasgow Rangers explain why Mr. Souness has so much money for transfer fees. I am glad that the Opposition support the clause in principle. I welcome the constructive spirit of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Wrexham.<br><br>
Amendment (a) proposes a new start date for the clause. We have already discussed that. New clause 60 was constructed so that it applies automatically from whatever date new clause 59 reduces duty. The amendment would not affect relief payments made out of duty reductions. It might also allow pools promoters to claim a deduction for other payments that do not relate to the duty reduction because the amendment omits the crucial requirement that the payment be made in consequence of the duty reduction.<br><br>
Amendments (b) and (c) would extend new clause 60 to cover payments made to meet revenue expenses of football clubs. That would have no effect because the Football trust has resolved to use pool betting duty money to pay only for capital improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Hoey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to listen and I know that we are in a hurry, but could the Minister speak a little louder?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments (b) and (c) would extend new clause 60 to cover payments made to meet revenue expenses of football clubs. They would have no effect because the Football trust has resolved to use pool betting duty money only for capital improvements.<br><br>
Amendment (d) seeks to make clear that the clause applies whether the Football trust pays all or only part of the cost incurred by a club. I assure the Committee that the clause, as drafted, meets that point. It applies simply where a payment meets "capital expenditure". That could be the whole or part of it.<br><br>
Amendment (e) would ensure that the clause covers Football trust grants to clubs that have not yet incurred expenditure on improvements. The amendment would give clubs a six-month period of grace in which to spend a grant after receiving it. The amendment introduces a time limit, when there is none in the clause. We are satisfied that no such specific limit is necessary because the Football trust will consider carefully when grants should be paid so that money will not sit idle in the hands of the clubs.<br><br>
Amendment (f) deals with clubs with more than one ground. Once again, the clause as drafted meets the problem.<br><br>
Amendment (g) is also unnecessary. It would provide relief for grounds used for playing football at the time that the payment is made, rather than only for grounds that will be used for the first time in future. Relief will be due in any case where a ground is "to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
used" to play football. The ground is "to be used" to play football next Saturday even if a game is being played today when the payment is made.<br><br>
Amendment (h) would clarify the period for which the pools companies get corporation tax relief for the payment that they make to the Football trust. It is unnecessary because the pools companies have agreed that they will make payments to the Football trust on the same weekly basis that they make payments of pool betting duty to customs. Ordinary tax rules will ensure that the pools companies get a tax deduction for each week's payment for the accounting period in which each week or part week falls. There is no need for a special rule.<br><br>
In view of the assurances that I have made and the responses that I have provided to the Opposition's helpful amendments, I hope that they will be withdrawn. I thank all Opposition Members for their contribution to this constructive debate. If I have not answered every point, I shall write to the hon. Members involved, because we are constrained by time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not strictly necessary to beg leave to withdraw the amendments, but subject to further scrutiny, we are satisfied with that explanation. We are glad that it is on the record and will not press any amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government new clause 63—<i>Capital allowances: vehicles provided by employees</i>—and Government amendment No. 298, a new schedule—<i>Limit on chargeable mileage profit.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I outline the background to our proposed arrangements for taxing mileage allowances at slightly longer length than is normally my wont, Mr. Coleman? I shall endeavour to do so reasonably crisply.<br><br>
Under the statutory rules, mileage allowances paid by employers to employees for using their own cars for work are taxable to the extent that they exceed those motoring costs which the employee necessarily incurs travelling in the performance of the duties of the employment. The operation of those rules case by case involves a great deal of detailed record keeping work for employers who have to return details to the Revenue of the allowances paid to employees in respect of motoring costs. To get tax relief, employees themselves have to keep detailed records of their costs and the amount of mileage driven—both privately and on business—so that they can make a claim for tax relief after the end of each year.<br><br>
For many years, and to cut down on the amount of effort needed by all involved, the Revenue has operated voluntary administrative arrangments—the fixed profit car scheme—to charge tax on any profit element in the mileage allowances that some employees receive. About 500,000 employees are covered by the fixed profit car scheme—FPCS—arrangements at present.<br><br>
The FPCS arrangements establish the taxable amount in the mileage allowance paid to an employee by reference to tax-free rates which the Revenue sets each year. Those rates are intended as a proxy for the average tax allowable costs of running cars in a range of engine sizes. For each employer who operates the FPCS arrangements, the Revenue tabulates each year, by reference to bands of business mileage, fixed profits which take account of the amount by which the employer's allowance exceeds the appropriate FPCS tax-free rate. Establishing the profit on which tax is payable in that way makes the arrangements very attractive to employers, employees and the Revenue alike because it cuts down on the detailed information which has to be maintained and processed.<br><br>
Unfortunaely, it has now emerged that the FPCS arrangements have over the years become too generous. Under them, many people now receive much more tax relief than the law permits. There are three reasons for that.<br><br>
First, the FPCS tax-free rates include relief for depreciation to which most employees are not entitled under the present statutory capital allowance rules. The arrangements were first set up almost 20 years ago for certain limited groups of taxpayers who were statutorily entitled to relief for depreciation. Since then, however, many employees covered by the arrangements now have the option of company cars. Such an option would mean that there was no longer the need "necessarily"—the word used in the statute—to provide a car as the law requires. Further, the administrat-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
ive attractions have resulted in the FPCS being extended to a wide range of employees outside its original scope.<br><br>
Secondly, the FPCS rates give too much relief for standing charges such as car tax, insurance and sevicing because the costs involved are not properly spread when business mileage is high. As the FPCS arrangements stand, it is possible in some cases for relief to be given for more than the total standing costs incurred. That is clearly not a sensible or defensible result.<br><br>
Thirdly, the rates of relief themselves have become too high compared with average motoring costs.<br><br>
If the Revenue were to change its FPCS arrangements to bring them more into line with the present underlying statutory rules, a considerable number of people who currently use their cars for work would have to pay more tax. Some—particularly high business mileage drivers using large cars—would have to pay substantially more. We do not believe that that would be right. Instead, we propose a number of changes in the taxation of mileage allowances.<br><br>
First, we propose to relax the capital allowance rules so that all employees who can claim tax relief on their motoring costs when using their own cars for work will also be able to claim capital allowances. That means that the FPCS tax-free rates can, legitimately, continue to include an element of relief for depreciation. This is what new clause 63 does. Because relief for interest on loans taken out to buy a car for work use is linked to eligibility for capital allowances, the proposed relaxation in the capital allowance rules will mean that loans taken out to buy a car will attract interest relief to the extent that it is used for business. The change will allow business motorists who use their own cars to have a fairer statutory basis for tax relief, which in future will cover all motoring costs. It does not make much sense to give relief for one kind of motoring expense but not another, as happens under the present statute.<br><br>
Secondly, the Revenue will make changes to the FPCS arrangements to ensure that they properly reflect the underlying statute. At present, the top FPCS rate of relief applies to cars of 1,500 cc. and over. That rate will be split in two to cover cars of 1,500 to 2,000 cc, and cars of more than 2,000 cc. That will allow the higher costs of running larger cars to be recognised properly. All existing rates will be frozen until average motoring costs catch them up.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
The biggest change to FPCS will be the introduction of reduced tax free rates for business mileages in excess of 4,000 miles a year. That break-point is a common feature in many employers' mileage schemes. It will ensure that within the FPCS arrangements standing costs are spread over the total mileage driven, both business and private, and that tax relief is confined to the business proportion of motoring costs. As a result of the changes, most employees will pay no more tax on their mileage allowances than at present. Some may pay less, but a number of people—especially those who drive business mileages above the new 4,000 mile break-point—will pay more tax.<br><br>
The third ingredient of our proposed package of measures is to give transitional relief to those facing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0271">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
increased tax liabilities as a result of the changes. That is provided by new clause 62 and new schedule 298. Broadly, the relief ensures that nobody who received a mileage allowance from his employer in 1989–90 for using his own car for work will pay, as a result of the changes, any more tax on mileage allowances than in 1990–91. In each subsequent year, the amount of extra tax payable as a result will be restricted to a maximum of £250 for basic rate taxpayers, and £400 for those who pay at the higher rate of tax.<br><br>
As I said, this is a balanced package of changes. The intention is to ensure consistency between the law and practice of taxing mileage allowance paid to employees. The Exchequer effect of the changes is therefore expected to be broadly neutral. We do not expect the changes to bring in extra revenue to the Exchequer. I hope that that clarifies the rationale that underpins the package.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways the new clause is long overdue. The taxation of benefits has contained anomalies, and sometimes benefits have been paid that were clearly greater than necessary to enable employees to exercise their duties. Sometimes those benefits have not been taxed. The Government have made an attempt at overhauling a system that has long needed to be re-examined.<br><br>
The bad news is that new clause 62 and amendment No. 298 were tabled only a few days ago. It has been very difficult to determine what the changes in taxation will mean to various groups of people. However, it is not easy to defend the payment to Members of Parliament of allowances of 61.9p a mile for mileages of 10,000 or 20,000 a year. That is a lot of money, and the Government are right to examine the matter.<br><br>
The package will effect people throughout the country, not just Members of Parliament. However, we do not know whether the district nurse in a rural area will be adversely affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a valid point about the allowance of 61.9p a mile that is paid for some of the larger cars. When all political parties are displaying green tinges, it is hard to justify such high mileage allowances for cars with a high cubic capacity. Perhaps we should encourage the use of cars that use less petrol.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we should encourage the use of cars that are economical on petrol. We should also encourage public servants to use public transport unless it is necessary for them to travel by car. That is one of my hobby-horses, but I shall not digress. The present system has got out of hand and it needs to be curbed. Although I understand the Government's reasons for introducing the provision, I have reservations about the effects of the change.<br><br>
Can the Financial Secretary say how the Capital Allowances Act 1990 will operate in tandem with the new clause? Will the Treasury issue guidelines? The public want to know what taxation will be when the new regime comes into operation. Are many applications for relief expected under section 198 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988? In practice, the Treasury has given dispensation to a few schemes.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
Will the new regime mean a lot of extra work for the Treasury? What will be the effect on rural areas? Who will lose and who will gain? Salesmen using large cars may lose as a result of the new clause, but will salesmen and insurance agents who do high mileages in small cars lose out? I do not mean "lose" in the sense of losing the profit that they make because they are paid a mileage rate that more than covers their costs, but will they lose out because they will have to pay tax, which they cannot recover, on the difference between the mileage allowance and the costs of running their cars? The new clause was tabled only a few days ago and I suspect that some groups of employees will be disadvantaged.<br><br>
I ask my hon. Friends not to support new clause 62. I make that request not in a definitive way—the new regime is not bad—but simply because we do not have enough details. If the Financial Secretary can assure us that health visitors, district nurses or insurance salesmen who need cars to carry out their work and who receive a reasonable mileage rate will not suffer, we shall not argue with the new clause, but I doubt whether he can. However, I have not had much time to study the provisions. We should fire a warning shot across the Government's bows to make them realise that it is not right to table new clauses three or four days before they are debated so that we cannot get the views of our constituents.<br><br>
By saying that, I hope that the Financial Secretary will not get the wrong idea.and think that we are against the measure. I hope that the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) will agree that a rate of 61.9p a mile, with unlimited mileage, for Members of Parliament and others who receive such a large allowance is indefensible. We want a generally acceptable mileage limit that would be free of tax. Any mileage allowance paid above that would be a benefit in kind and should be taxed. I am sure that we all agree on that, but it is not clear whether the provisions will achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of the analysis of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) but have not come to the same conclusion. I shall try to persuade him to dissuade his hon. Friends from rejecting the proposals.<br><br>
Representing a rural area, I am concerned about the effects of such a change in Inland Revenue practice on those who with high mileages, particularly health visitors. However, I understand that the change will take place anyway. The Inland Revenue is saying that if it interprets the existing law correctly, a considerable tax burden could be placed on many people, including those the hon. Gentleman wishes to be protected. The proposals will provide transitional relief. Rejection of the proposals could put those people in a much worse position than if they were accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another problem with the new clauses has arisen because the Inland Revenue has decided to interpret the law and apply it. There are no provisions to introduce the new regime. We are merely assuming
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
that the new regime will be applied and measures are being introduced to provide relief. That makes the matter very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wallace</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is very diffficult. The law already exists, and some effort is being made to ease it.<br><br>
Working examples would help us, particularly in the areas or occupations to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I would hesitate to deprive some people of relief when, without it, they would be under a substantial tax burden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) recognised that action was long overdue. We have taken relieving action, designed to minimise the burden that taxpayers would feel if the law, as it stands, were properly applied.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman regretted the late tabling of the new clauses, as I do. However, we had to wait until we had worked out a solution to the problem. That involved a great deal of research and ingenuity, not least in the development of the transitional arrangements in new clause 62. We could not leave this until next year because the law had to be enforced. I was keen to ensure that the clauses were tabled in time for the Committee to examine them. The House can return to the matter on Report, if it wishes. I did not want to bounce the House by delaying matters until Report and I am glad that we avoided that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked whether guidelines will be sent to employers. The answer is yes. The Revenue will be writing to all employers shortly, but it has, quite correctly, waited until today's debate.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether salesmen in small cars doing high mileages will lose more than profit. If their costs are higher than the FPCS all taxpayers have the option of being taxed on the basis of their actual costs. Under the statutory rules, they can then get full relief for their actual costs. Therefore, there is protection.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned one or two other categories. By and large, district nurses who do high mileages have company cars owned by the national health service. Usually only district nurses doing the lower mileages use their own private cars.<br><br>
In general the maximum that anyone can lose under the transitional arrangements would be nothing this year, a maximum of £250 at their basic rate as taxpayers next year, and then increments at £250 thereafter. It is unlikely that anyone in that position will be losing a large sum beyond that £250.<br><br>
7.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham talked about overall distribution. About 85 per cent. of all those receiving mileage allowances from their employer do fewer than 4,000 business miles, so most will not be affected by the introduction of the 4,000 mile break-point. Most will experience no increase in their tax burden, indeed in certain cases they may have a reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary write to me or my hon. Friends before Report saying how he envis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
ages that the new change will effect different types of people, for example district nurses?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman an example now. A district nurse with a car of 1,000 to 1,500 ccs, doing 2,000 miles a year would at present, under nationally agreed mileage scales, pay £140 worth of tax. Under the new scheme he or she would still pay that. At 5,000 miles a person currently paying £110 worth of tax would have to pay £155, an increase of £45 in tax. However, that is tax on a benefit. If that individual can show that his or her business costs are greater than the FPCS scheme assumes, they will not even pay that extra amount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a difficult question. If the Financial Secretary can provide detailed information of the new scheme and the rates at which any money paid in mileage would be regarded as a benefit, the Opposition could consider that and return to it on Report. In that case, I would be pleased not to force a Division on the new clause at present. However, we would need to have his assistance in providing such information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable request, and I should be happy to try to oblige in whatever form is most convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press a Division on new clause 62 as it contains the transitional arrangements, if it were to be defeated, people would find that the full rigour of the law would affect them immediately, with no transitional relief. I am sure that the Opposition do not wish that any more than the Government</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I shall be brief. I am obliged to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) for accomodating me in this matter. As my hon. Friend knows, I am not a latter day convert to the new clauses. I raised them with my right hon. Friend the Member for Brain-tree (Mr. Newton) when he was at the Department of Trade and Industry. I raised them with my right hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Chan-non) when he was Secretary of State for Transport and with my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont) before he became Chief Secretary.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
A committee has been set up to investigate these matters under the chairmanship of Sir Jeffrey Sterling, now president of the General Council of British Shipping. I understand that that committee is due to report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport by 14 September. It will be a wide-ranging review, examining the cost of the United Kingdom register and of other EEC member state vessels flagging in. Those are not strictly matters for the Committee, but it is worrying that United Kingdom shipping is not on a level playing field.<br><br>
London is the base for 50 per cent of the world's ship-broking business and 50 per cent of world marine insurance premiums are paid there. Britain's mutual insurance, protection and indemnity, clubs have 70 per cent of the world tonnage. Lloyd's Register is the world's largest classification society, with nearly 30 per cent of all new buildings. Moreover, London leads the world in maritine, banking, arbitration and legal activity. I cannot believe that there is no link between this country's invisible earnings and the size of her shipping fleet. If that is the argument, surely Switzerland, not London, would be the shipping centre of the world.<br><br>
As a non-interventionist sort of chap greeted with a commendatory press release on the abolition of capital allowances and stock relief, I could not understand why my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer moved to abolish stamp duty on the stock market with the introduction of TAURUS to ensure that London maintained its edge as one of the financial capitals of the world; nor could I understand why we have a benign tax regime for international banking and currency dealing, yet do not recognise that our invisibles—declining for the first time in our history—are inexorably entwined with the United Kingdom fleet.<br><br>
I strongly believe that all our shipping activities—such as Lloyd's of London, in which I declare an interest, and the Baltic exchange—are like the Turks head worked into the end of the ship's hawser: they are inexorably intertwined.<br><br>
I shall turn to the effects of new clauses 4 and 5. The General Council of British Shipping calculates conservatively that, at a cost in deferred taxation over a five-year period of £750 million, foreign exchange earnings of £7.5 billion would be generated over the lives estimated at 15 years of the 200 ships expected to be acquired. It also calculates that the cost in deferred taxation would be £250 million over five years on the basis of 40 ships being replaced each year. These ships would generate over £7.5 billion in foreign exchange earnings over their 15-year lives.<br><br>
I direct the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister to the fact that Norway is making a positive bid to take over from London as the world shipping centre of the world. Sooner or later, the problems that I have raised will have to be resolved directly throught the Treasury. We must maintain our edge both within the EEC and in the highly competitive shipping world.<br><br>
Lloyd's of London has an excellent arrangement with the Treasury—both with the elective and the executive. That is as it should be. It recognises the important part that Lloyd's plays in our balance of

earnings capability. Unfortunately, since I have been a Member, we do not seem to have had the same easy conduit of information and arrangement with the Treasury that demonstrates the force of my argument tonight. I hope that I shall win the day and that once again Britannia will rule the waves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) has a deep and long-held interest in this matter, which has been raised in three previous Finance Bills. Like my predecessor, I must point out that the proposals might entail about £200 million a year—a mere bagatelle—of corporation tax designed to bring allowances more into line with the economic life of assets. Ships usually have much longer lives than the life over which we depreciate them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
Although we recognise the immensely important part played by the shipping industry, its fortunes were not markedly better—if anything, they were worse—before the 1984 tax reforms. I shall consider carefully my hon. Friend's remarks, but I cannot urge the Committee to accept the new clauses and hope that my hon. Friend will not press them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend but, like an Isle of Wight ferry, I shall be back again and again and again. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
