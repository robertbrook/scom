PROVISIONS OF ACCOMMODATION AND WELFARE SERVICES: AGENCY ARRANGEMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Amendment proposed <i>[this day],</i> No. 475, in page 38, leave out lines 27 to 34, and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"who manages a residential care home within the meaning of Part I of the Registered Homes Act 1984, which is—

for the provision of accommodation in that home.".—<i>[Ms. Harman.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are discussing also the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 329, in page 39, leave out lines 5 to 10, and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(ID) Any person applying for registration of a home as set out in the Registered Homes Act 1984 shall disclose any criminal record to the registration authority.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(IE) On request of the registration authority, police shall disclose relevant convictions of any person applying for registration. Relevant convictions are:
<ol>
<li>murder;</li>
<li>manslaughter;</li>
<li>infanticide;</li>
<li>gross indecency;</li>
<li>incest or other offence involving bodily injury;</li>
<li>fraud; (h) theft; </li>
<li>blackmail;</li>
<li>impersonation; </li>
<li>any other offence set out in the Registered Homes Act 1984.</li></ol>
Such a person shall be informed of this step and permitted to check the records.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(1F) When a registered proprietor or member of staff at a registered home is conviced of a criminal offence the courts shall inform all registration authorities in whose area the offender has an interest and the Department of Health.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 476, in page 39, line 12, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"small home" means an establishment falling within section 1(4) of the Registered Homes Act 1984 and.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 477, in page 39, line 29, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6)In section 1(4) of the Registered Homes Act 1984 (requirement for registration) the word "not" shall be omitted and for the words "fewer than four persons, excluding persons carrying on or intending to carry on the home or employed or intended to be employed there and their relatives" substitute "any person".'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining the Government's efforts to ensure that standards in residential
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 794</span>
homes are maintained and enhanced. I referred to our consultation document on independent inspection units. The amendment proposes that we should bring units with fewer than four residents within the terms of the Registered Homes Act 1984. That would involve the inspection unit in a great deal of work at a time when they are already embarking on their new tasks, establishing standards and working with those involved to ensure that the policies are effective. That provision would be an additional burden on small units, many of which are already effective.<br><br>
The amendment refers to the problem of criminal records. At the moment the Department has a national list of those whose restriction of a home was refused or cancelled or who are considered not to be fit people. The national list is made available to local authorities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) mentioned a provision in the Children Act 1989 that criminal records should be made available. Further experimental schemes are underway to consider the extent to which that could be carried into the voluntary child care sector.<br><br>
It is not appropriate at this stage to apply the availability of criminal records provision to those involved in the care of the elderly. But the system will be monitored as it moves forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at the Minister's stance on this issue. She said that the national list of cancellations can be made available to local authorities. However, what good is that if they do not have the power to move into a home where there are problems and to remove the individuals involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the overlap between the concern about someone's previous record and the question of registration that worries us. We want to look further at the amendments, not to implement an onerous system of registration for smaller homes, but to consider whether there is a way in which we can tackle these issues which understandably cause anxiety.<br><br>
Those who apply for the formal registration of a home must complete a form and reveal previous criminal records, whether spent or otherwise. The right way forward is not to raise expectations that a laborious, complex system of registration is envisaged. The Wagner report stated consideration should be given to those homes with fewer than four residents, but that they should not be subject to the full panoply of inspection and control.<br><br>
To allay anxieties and to ensure that necessary safeguards are in place, especially on the issue of criminal records, I shall take the amendments away and return at a later stage having discussed the issue with local authority associations, residential home owners and others.<br><br>
Our philosophy on the care-in-the-community proposals is to work with local authority associations to establish what can be achieved and to set the priorities. I hope, therefore, that the amendment will be withdrawn and that we can return at a later stage to consider whether further progress can be made in tackling those understandable worries.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0780">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 795</span>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister realises that there is a real problem when many of the people who run homes and look after vulnerable, dependent elderly folk are unfit to fulfil that role, and that she accepts that the point has been made for some time, not only by my colleagues and me, but by directors of social services, social services authorities and by those responsible for inspection. I welcome her recognition of the problem of people with criminal records running old people's homes and evading the registration procedure by setting up a home or by continuing to run a home that is so small that it escapes registration.<br><br>
However, the Minister was not as precise as I should have wished about what she intended to do. She recognised the problem and said that she would take the amendments away and bring forward proposals on Report to address the two issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say "on Report"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Later—or on Report. The point is that we want to extend protection and we want a system that is workable and right. If we accept what the Minister said in good faith—that she is prepared to do something—I think that we shall be prepared to withdraw the amendment. However, we shall want to be certain that the proposals that she intends to introduce on Report will actually deal with the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not have been looking at the Minister's face when my hon. Friend repeated what she thought that the Minister had said. The Minister qualified, from a sedentary position, what my hon. Friend said when she referred to Report, and she said, "Later". So there is no intention to table amendments on Report to deal with these matters. If that is not correct, perhaps the Minister will clarify it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'> rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that we would bring it back at a later stage. I was clarifying the words that I used earlier. I hope very much that it will be on Report, but that may be over-optimistic, because, as I said, we want to have discussions with all the people who are involved in the management and inspection of homes to see what can be done to tackle the difficulties. It is very easy for Opposition Members to pile intention and duty, one after another, on local authorities. We want the policy to be a success. We want care in the community to work. We know that the agenda that we are imposing on local authorities will be considerable over the coming year, and we want to be sure that they can complete it within the time scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand from what the Minister says that she recognises that there is a problem, that the Government intend to do something effective about it,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 796</span>
and that they may not necessarily produce the final drafted amendment on Report because they want to consult the relevant organisations in the meantime. We have been consulting organisations for years—social workers, inspectors, the proprietors of registered homes, local authority associations, and people concerned with the Wagner committee. If the Minister now intends to embark on those consultations, we shall be prepared to withdraw the amendment, but there must be a definite intention to do something about the problem and a recognition of the strong feelings of Labour Members and the agitation among Conservative Back Bench Members. We shall withdraw the amendment at this stage, but we shall expect definite progress on Report. Even as we speak, elderly, vulnerable and dependent people are at risk because they are being looked after in residential nursing homes by people who are wholly unsuitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say earlier that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health clearly indicated assent when the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) mentioned a later stage. I appreciate that it may not be possible to bring forward satisfactory amendments on Report but it may be possible at later stages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To avoid ambiguity, will the Minister for Health say whether she intends simply, to look at the problem, or to do something about it? That is a relatively simple question. We obviously feel that she should act and not simply consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have made myself very clear on several occasions. We want local authorities to be able to fulfil important responsibilities that we are imposing on them. It is clear that if they had to undertake a major, full-scale registration of the smaller homes in the foreseeable future, it would be a considerable additional burden. It might be possible to address the question, and allay people's anxieties, without adopting the comprehensive form of registration that the larger homes use. That would address the point about criminal records, and it would take the matter forward. We certainly intend to address the question with all possible speed. We also intend to have discussions with those most directly involved to find out what is realistic and achievable, and what will satisfactorily address the difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem seems to be that the longer the Minister takes to answer, the less we know about her intentions.<br><br>
Our position, in summary, is that we have presented evidence that shows an urgent need for action. The Minister cannot doubt that something must be done. I understand that she will consider what to do. We have the opportunity on Report to bring back these amendments and to put them to a vote. We shall work with local authorities, professional organisations, and people in our constituencies and throughout the country to try to encourage the Minister to recognise that action is urgently needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend the Minister has not finished her deliberations—and time
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0781">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 797</span>
is always short as Bills motor on in this place—she might consider introducing an order-making power. That would enable her to introduce regulations later. I suggest that because I should be grateful to have the support of the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) for anything that would enable us to keep the matter on the agenda. We continue to press my hon. Friend to bring in the regulations as soon as she can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hincliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather worried. The Government have already had plenty of time to come forward with proposals, yet they are not contained in the Bill. We know that the problem exists. It has been debated, and mentioned in numerous reports, including Griffiths and Wagner, and in numerous articles in the social work press. I understand that it is difficult to register the smaller homes. But why does the Minister object to the criminal conviction question? Is she waiting for a scandal and a public inquiry into the abuse of an old person by criminals? She has not given one reason for objecting to amendment No. 329.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Minister has pointed out that protection is accorded to children, but she said that the same sort of mechanism could not be used to protect elderly people. However, she has given no reason for the difference. She has complicated the issue by saying that she will consider both sets of amendments. We should all be grateful if my hon Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) could clarify what the Minister said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I jotted down one of two of the Minister's excuses, and I believe that she referred to onerous regulations and laborious and complex regulations. We are talking of people convicted of murder, manslaughter, infanticide, gross indecency, incest or other offences, such as fraud, theft, blackmail and impersonation, as set out in the Registered Homes Act 1984. These are vulnerable people, and the Minister must give a commitment of intent. The public and the press will understand the message if she waffles on this one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention, which reinforced my point. We will not divide the Committee on the amendment because we are anxious that the matter be reviewed on Report.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not be aware that any person who applies for a hackney cab licence will know that all the details about himself are on the police computer and these will accompany his application. The information that we seek is already available and easily accessible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the Government's interest is in small businesses and preventing anything from hindering them from flourishing, while our con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 798</span>
cern is to protect vulnerable and elderly people who are being cared for by small businesses. That is what distinguishes our approach. We are anxious that the Government take action. We shall await Report to see what they propose by way of concrete workable ideas for protecting those who currently are at risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard many Ministers over the years wriggle out of amendments and out of giving undertakings to Committees. Government Back Benchers have been given what they think are undertakings but, because words are selected carefully, Ministers do not have to keep them. The Minister said that she would consult and address the question. I do not interpret that as commitment by the Government that they intend to act. A conversation has been taking place between the Secretary of State and the Minister for Health for the past 10 minutes. They have discussed the use of words. The hon. Lady said to her right hon. and learned Friend from a sedentary position, "Can I say that?" All I asked of her was an assurance that there will be an attempt to bring—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said many things to my right hon. and learned Friend but I did not use the words that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That proves my point about seated interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All we want is a statement of assurance that the Government will deal with the problems that my hon. Friend outlined. Problems have been identified and we want a promise that they will be dealt with. If we get it, at least there is a hope that something may happen on Report, or after. We have had no commitment that the Government intend to tackle the problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have explained the position several times. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the <i>Hansard</i> report of our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As nobody is rising to speak, I shall put the Question, unless the amendment is being withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 497, in page 39, line 1, after "(1B)", insert "except in an emergency".<br><br>
The amendment seeks to exclude from part of clause 37 provision for emergency admissions to a residential home. The White Paper makes no proposal for a veto by hospital authorities on admission to nursing homes. Paragraph 3.7.2 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"a nursing home place should be secured only if the assessment establishes the need for nursing care as the whole or main component of the care required."</p></blockquote>
I may have missed it, but I could not see that veto. It seems odd to place an obligation to assess on the local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0782">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 799</span>
authority and give another body, the health authority, the opportunity to veto the treatment prescribed.<br><br>
Some establishments that deal with drug addicts or alcoholics provide nursing care, although they are basically residential establishments, and it would be impossible for them to admit drug addicts or alcoholics without having the prior consent of the DHA. The City Roads (Crisis Intervention) centre, which I have visited, has a high proportion of nurses working there, and they are worried that it would be impossible for them to admit people who presented themselves for help. We are talking about people who may be a danger not just to themselves but to others. Some safety valve whereby they can be admitted to such establishments without the prior consent of the DHA is needed.<br><br>
This part of the Bill is also of interest to Alcohol Concern. Its clients often present themselves in an unplanned way and it does not want to have to contact the DHA for clearance to admit. I understand that clause 37 is not aimed at them. It is aimed at the normality of nursing home provision, and I understand in those circumstances the DHA should have a role in deciding the appropriate treatment. But, inadvertently, it prevents the rapid emergency admission for treatment of drug users and alcoholics, some of whom are at risk from HIV infection and other diseases. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can find a way to reassure the type of organisations to which I have referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not able to accept my hon. Friend's amendment because the purpose of the White Paper and the provision that we are establishing is to maintain the distinction between social care and health care. Enabling the authorisation of the health authority to be omitted in some cases would undermine that principle. We have considered many cases in which there are fears that the provision will inadvertently undermine the position, but we are not satisfied that that is so. Some of the groups to which my hon. Friend referred are anxious about the distinction between nursing homes and residential homes. Under our provision there will be greater clarity. The key point is that assessment will have to be swift, and perhaps when we discuss assessment later we can establish that in all circumstances adequate arrangements will be made for it. We expect health authorities to continue to make arrangements for medical care for emergencies, but we feel that the amendment would undermine the basic principle that health care and social care can be analysed. One of the strengths of the Griffiths report was to make that point. If one is trying to get different agencies to work together, having a clearer division of responsibilities is important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat dismayed. There are great merits in dividing social care from health care in principle. The Griffiths report had useful things to say about that. However, at the ragged edges of practicality, those distinctions become extremely difficult to maintain, and the people who will suffer from such a division will be the patients themselves. The Bill appears to say that an alcoholic who has grown accustomed to a treatment and rehabilitation centre and weaves his unhappy way close to it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 800</span>
before collapsing in a heap, often in the middle of the night, shall not be taken in to that centre without the DHA first being consulted.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure us that under the terms of the Bill it will be possible for such centres at least to make a standing arrangement with the DHA so that they will not break the law if they respond to an emergency of the sort that I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's point. It is important, and bears very much on the arrangements for assessment and planning. We shall discuss both plans and assessments in later clauses. But it is clear that there will be many circumstances in which swift decisions will be required. However, I must repeat that if we undermine the basic principle that the health authority provides consent for people to enter nursing homes, it undermines the fundamental principle involved in the division of responsibility.<br><br>
When we have completed our discussions on assessments and plans, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel that his concerns are satisfactorily addressed. I am most reluctant to accept his amendment to allow an exception to the requirement to be written into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the reservations of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe). One problem is that people cannot be assessed until they are admitted, and they cannot be admitted without the consent of the DHA. With an institution like City roads (Crisis Intervention) centre local authorities may be happy to have a series of contracts and to pay for all the places because they have confidence in that establishment to assess and treat. However, someone who qualifies for admission, assessment and treatment could present himself at City roads (Crisis Intervention) and be turned away. That is what the Bill says. Although that centre provides residential accommodation with nursing care on one can be admitted under clause 37(2)(1B) without the consent of the DHA.<br><br>
The role of such organisations will be undermined if we persists with this rather bureaucratic attempt to distinguish between health care and social service care. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take the opportunity between now and Report to reassure such organisations, who do useful work, that they will not have to turn people away who clearly need admission and assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak but having listened carefully to the arguments I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to think again very carefully. If the matters sensibly raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) and for Ealing, Acton (Sir G.

Friend the Minister is saying that no way, and no how, can the situations mentioned by my hon. Friends be dealt with, the position will be very unsatisfactory and we shall perhaps feel that the Department has not thought the matter through carefully enough.</span></p>

If that is so, it is difficult to see how, in the circumstances envisaged by my hon. Friend the Minister for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), such a thorough assessment could take place. It will be a pity if that is omitted from the Bill and the problems that my hon. Friend outlined occur. Therefore, I hope that my hon.

The purpose of the clause is to ensure that the institutions undertake their tasks more effectively without some of the complexities of funding and some of the uncertainty. Assessment plans and other arrangements will ensure that there is clarity and simplicity and that people know precisely where they stand. It is clear that my hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to solve a problem that weekly afflicts tens of thousands of elderly people who are resident in private old folk's homes. It equally afflicts and perplexes hundreds of owners of private old folks' homes.<br><br>
In the bipartisan spirit that from time to time, and against our better judgment, broke out earlier, I noticed that one or two Conversatives Member taxed Opposition Members with always being critical of the owners of private residential homes. I assure the Committee that 99 per cent. of what I shall say will be echoed and supported by every private owner of a residential care home.<br><br>
There is a growing gap between the level of income support which the Government are willing to pay to the residents of old folks' homes and the amount that the private owners are obliged to charge if they are to succeed in keeping a roof over their own heads as well as over those of their residents. That is a human problem now and it has myriad implications for the new system for which the clause paves the way.<br><br>
The background to the issue is easily sketched in. It stems from 1980 when the Conservative Administration changed the rules on income support so that elderly residents could claim income support to pay the bill for accommodation in private residential care. The result of the change—I presume that it was the intended result—was an explosion in the number of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0784">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 803</span>
elderly people seeking residential care on income support and in the growth of private homes on the back of the new market. The single most dramatic change in spending on care in the community under this Administration has been the growth in spending on income support to people entering private residential care. It rose from £10 million in 1980 to almost £1 billion last year.<br><br>
The 1 per cent of my speech that the owners of private homes will not support is that I believe that that money might have been more effectively and appreciatively spent by expanding public provision rather than on subsidising the expansion of private homes. That would have avoided one of the unfortunate by-blows of that expansion. Large numbers of elderly people now in private residential care have passed the means test for income support without necessarily fulfilling social or medical criteria for requiring residential care. The numbers are sometimes exaggerated, but, even if it is 10 per cent of the total, it still amounts to perhaps 10,000 elderly people who are being supported in residential care by public funds. They might be more appropriately supported by public funds in their own homes.<br><br>
I seek bipartisan support and to be as non-contentious as possible, difficult though the learning curve may be. Ideological reasons may have prompted Conservative Members to embark on the expansion of residential care solely by paying social security to private owners. I accept that it was their right to do so, as they had the power to get it through Parliament. However, I cannot accept—neither, I suspect, can private owners and Conservative Members—that, having facilitated the expansion of private residential care on income support, the Government reneged on the bills that started to roll in as a result of their policy.<br><br>
IN 1985, the Government changed the rules again. Instead of meeting the full bill for the cost of private residential care, the Department of Social Security imposed a flat limit, payable according to type of residential care. Since 1985, those flat rate payments have been uprated at a rate that is ludicrously behind the rate at which charges in homes have increased. In fairness to the owners, they had to increase their charges if they were to make ends meet.<br><br>
I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) for an imaginative parliamentary question that extracted the same figures on a year-by-year basis, reduced to real, not funny money, taking inflation out of the calculation. From the parliamentary answer, we learnt that the real value of the average payment in private residential homes through income support fell in the year after the change. Even in 1989, five years later, the real increase in the average payment on income support to people in private residential care was only £4 a week higher than in 1984. The result is that there is overwhelming, comprehensive and consistent evidence of a dramatic gap between the average charge for private residential care and the average payment in income support. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) likes evidence to be produced in speeches to the Committee. He demanded more evidence when last I spoke. I assure him that he will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 804</span>
have evidence by the bucket full. As plainly he is moved by evidence, I hope, with confidence, to anticipate his vote at the end of the debate.<br><br>
Last July, Age Concern called a conference which was attended by 37 voluntary and private home owners and providers of care. Each reported that they had difficulty living within income support levels. The British Federation of Care Home Proprietors, a body that represents only the private enterprise sector, reported that the average gap between income support payments and their charges was £40 a week—the Royal United Kingdom Benevolent Association—RUKBA stated that the average gap was £24. The Occupational Benevolent Funds Alliance reported that the average gap in its homes was £44 per week.<br><br>
Meanwhile, the charities which attended that conference reported an upsurge in desperate pleas from elderly people caught in a position of being faced with bills that they could not pay. Counsel and Care for the Elderly reported that in the preceding 12 months 3,000 new inquiries came from elderly people faced with bills that they could not pay and with no home to which to return.<br><br>
It may be contended that Age Concern has an axe to grind, that it may employ wonderful warm, caring people, "but that it does not have a hard-nosed business sense or a nose for figures. Lest that happen, let me turn to a recent report by Laing and Buisson, an entirely commercial company that advises people on investment prospects, especially in health care. It has a hard-nosed, businesslike approach. Indeed, its hard-nosed grasp of figures is clearly shown by the fact that, if one wishes to have a copy of its report, one must pay £190.<br><br>
What did those hard-nosed business men conclude in their analysis of investment opportunities for this sector? Having investigated income support payments and average charges in about 500 homes, the company found that less than 3 per cent. of private residential homes managed to provide accommodation at charges within income support levels. The average charge for a single room was £43 a week higher than income support; the average charge for even a shared room was £29 above income support. Perhaps it is worth noting that this company, which did not set out with a commitment to charting social need, was obliged to express its concern at the emergence of a two-tier market and reported that income-supported customers without top-ups usually had access to shared rooms only in the private sector. It cannot be satisfactory to any member of the Committee to know that a two-tier private residential care market is developing in which people on income support are getting less than average provision in pivate homes.<br><br>
The last item of evidence that I wish to share with the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and his colleagues comes from the National Federation for Housing Associations. Helpfully, its results are provided by locality, so we can see individual results, and they make interesting reading. I will help Conservative Members with some figures from their constituencies. I note that the hon. member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) is with us, assiduous as always in Committee. The association found four homes in Bromley in which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0785">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 805</span>
average charge was £31 to £37 higher than income support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only four?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only four were surveyed. I happily accept the hon. Gentlemen's helpful contribution. Only four were in the survey, but as the hon. Gentleman implied, had more been included the same pattern would probably have emerged.<br><br>
In Kent—which is well represented on the Conservative Benches—five homes were included in the survey. The charges there were £50 to £98 a week higher than income support. I regret to tell the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) that only one home in his area was included in the survey: in that home in Acton, the charge was £75 a week higher than income support.<br><br>
I am pleased to report to the Minister that two homes were surveyed in Surrey. One charged £84 a week more than income support, and lest that be thought excessive let me point out that the other charged £108 a week more than income support. Rather surprisingly, given the size of the county of Nottinghamshire and its importance to our future political prospects, only one home was included and, for the Secretary of State's information, the charge was £76 a week more than income support. I was about to issue an invitation to Conservative Member, but, in a bipartisan spirit, I will throw open the challenge to all hon. Members. I challenge any hon. Member present to name one residential home in his constituency which now charges fees that are within the income support figure paid by the DHSS.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The same pattern can be found by examination of any type of residential care other than that for the elderly. Indeed, the more intensive the care, the bigger the gap. I have also seen the report of a survey by the Independent Hospitals Association which represents private nursing homes. It shows that the gap between what independent hospitals are obliged to charge and what income support will pay them is £63 per week. If anyone imagines that the gap is the result of poor financial control on the part of private sector entrepreneurs, let me say that I have seen the breakdown of average weekly costs. It includes provision of only £14 a week for food. In case hon. Members wish to challenge whether the amounts charged by the independent hospitals are excessive, may I first ask whether any of them could survive on £14 a week for food?<br><br>
It is easy to quote statistics and forget that behind them lie many individual cases of stress, worry and anxiety—not perhaps always among residents because, frequently, they are so confused that they find it difficult to cope with additional stress and perhaps suffer a degree of ignorance about what is happening. Relatives always feel stress and anxiety. Often they themselves are retired because people in their 80s and 90s who are in residential care often have sons and daughters who tend to be in their 60s and 70s. As a result of that growing gap, there are tens of thousands of residents in private residential care who no longer receive the £10 weekly personal allowance that they are sup-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 806</span>
posed to have for toiletries, newspapers and postage. They are often supported by elderly relatives who let their own savings go to make good the gap, without a clear idea of how to provide for themselves once their savings have gone.<br><br>
As well as those individual human problems, there is the looming prospect of an immense problem being dumped on local authorities after the Bill is enacted. The Bill paves the way for the transfer of the income support payments to local authorities—money that otherwise would go to people on income support who enter residential care for the first time. However, if the transfer is to be made honestly, and to be meaningful, the amount of income support by which it is measured has to be honest and meaningful. If the income support expenditure is insufficient to pay present charges, the amount transferred to local authorities will not be sufficient to provide the same number of places that income support now provides.<br><br>
There can only be two solutions. Either local authorities buy fewer places for the same money, or they subsidise the places that they purchase with the money diverted from income support out of other budgets. That brings me to the logical question to Ministers: If they do not intend to increase income support to facilitate an honest transfer of resources to local authorities, what other social service budget can be raided to provide that subsidy for the gap that at present is topped up by relatives?<br><br>
We have again provided two amendments, offering Ministers a choice should they wish to respond to the problem. I do not mind which way Ministers choose to solve the problem, but I am determined that they at least recognise that there is a problem. Unless they do so, thousands of vulnerable residents will be stuck in what the White Paper laughably calls a preserved status. Preserved status means, at the present level of payments, that they will be preserved on an income support level which is not sufficient to pay bills which they cannot avoid now or in future, with no guarantee that even the present inadequate level of income support will rise to match future increases in those bills.<br><br>
As will as those human problems, there is a problem for local authorities. If transfer resources are calculated by reference to the present inadequate level of income support, there is the risk that the new scheme of diverting resources into local authorities will be exposed as little more than a cynical exercise in passing the buck to local authorities to plug the gap that Ministers are now unwilling to plug with realistic income support levels.<br><br>
I cannot conceive of a worse start to the new scheme of care in the community. If the Committee wishes to fulfil its job of scrutinising legislation and establishing the legislative framework for an adequate and proper scheme of care in the community to the end of the decade and into the next century, it must tackle this problem first and provide local authorities with a clean slate, a fresh start, to take over the problem.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). There is a consensus in the House on the matter, because every hon. Member will have constituency cases that illustrate the difficulty. Our constituency case loads reflect the vast numbers of people who have to beg, borrow or scrounge to meet the fees charged by private homes. My hon. Friend said that he suspected that private home owners would support the amendment, and I know many private home owners are subsidising people whose incomes are not sufficient to pay the fees.<br><br>
Some time ago, I asked a parliamentary question which was picked up by a private home owner in west Yorkshire. Having heard my question on the radio, he rang me on his car telephone to tell me that he was subsidising three elderly people, and that he had been subsidising them for the past two years. he had no intention of turfing them out. We know that some people are turfed out of private homes when their incomes run out, but there are plenty of decent people in the private sector who would not do that and who behave as the gentleman from Batley is behaving.<br><br>
As I said, there is a consensus in the House about the problem. The matter was raised recently in an Adjournment debate by a Conservative Back-Bench Member, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have created a predicament for the elderly and their carers. First, they stimulate the provision of homes . . . secondly, they create a financial gap as a result of one Department failing to match cost increases that are caused by another."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 January 1990; Vol. 165, c.1025.]</p></blockquote>
That was said by the hon. Member for Romsey and Waterside (Mr. Colvin). What he said made sense, and I am sure that he spoke for the majority of Members of Parliament who have to deal with the problem. I know that the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widde-combe)—to her credit, she is seeking to speak in this debate—has been worried about the matter for some time. She raised the case of Florence Smith, a 93-year-old constituent, and I am sure that we all have in our constituencies Florence Smiths with similar problems. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Maidstone will speak in support of the Opposition's endeavour to do something about the problem, and if she is really worried about the Florence Smiths of this world, perhaps she will vote for the amendments.<br><br>
I put a parliamentary question to the Minister for Social Security on 27 November 1989. It was about the difficulties that face people who have to spend their £10 a-week pocket money on the full cost of fees in private homes. I pointed out that they do not have a penny to spend on a bag of sweets, a new hair-do or underwear. I know of low-income families—even pensioners—and sons, daughters, nephews or nieces who pay £10 or £20 a week towards the cost of keeping relatives in homes. It is a scandal, and something should be done about it.<br><br>
The answer that I received from the Minister was such a shock that it was quoted by Age Concern, a reasonable and moderate organisation, in its briefing on "Moving the Goalposts".<br><br>
This is what he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I find nothing offensive in relatives helping the elderly in residential or nursing homes with their fees. It was never the intention from the introduction of income support that it should meet the cost of all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 808</span>
fees, however high they may be set. We are still confident that the system meets the majority of fees being charged, but other methods of topping up—by relatives, charities and other sources—is a central part of the system."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1989; Vol. 162, c.422.]</p></blockquote>
He is confident that the system meets the majority of fees being charged, but my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston has demonstrated that that is not right. I was astounded by the Minister's comments as was Age Concern.<br><br>
It all comes down to individual constituency cases. The hon. Member for Maidstone may tell us about her Mrs. Smith, who is 93. I have numerous cases in my constituency, and I mentioned two of them recently in the House—one on Second Reading. On the day that I received the Minister's reply, by a strange coincidence, I received a letter from a constituent, who told me that her husband, who had multiple sclerosis, had had to go into care. He was unable to pay the fees, having only 5p a week left after spending all his pocket money, and his wife was having to sell their house to raise the money. It is scandalous.<br><br>
I am in correspondence at the moment with the Under-Secretary of State for Health—unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman has left the Room—about a Mrs. Pauline Shaw, who is in a private nursing home. She is there because of the cuts in respite care made by the Government at Pinderfields general hospital, as a result of which the husband can no longer go there for regular breaks. Because of the lack of nursing care in the family home, Mrs. Shaw had to go into a home, although the husband did not want that. There is a £10 a week gap in the payments of fees, and the man has had to pay it out of his invalidity benefit. He is trying to run a car on about £41 a week, to travel the 20 miles to see his wife in her institutional setting.<br><br>
I wrote to the Secretary of State for Health, who referred the matter to the Under-Secretary of State, and I was told that the Health Service cannot top up. The woman needs nursing care. She was receiving nursing assistance; she was bathed. I am pleased to see that the Under-Secretary is back in his place. I am talking about the case of Mrs. Pauline Shaw, and I am awaiting a further reply from him. With the help of a charity, the £10 a week is being met, but I believe that that money should have come from the Health Service. Pauline Shaw needs nursing care, and the only excuse that the Government and local health authority have for not paying it is that she was not placed in that home by the Wakefield health authority, but by her husband, who was advised by his GP to give up caring for her at home because his health was being affected.<br><br>
We are receiving a very bureaucratic response to an appalling human situation. I want to hear further from the Minister about that case.<br><br>
It is clear that the Government have no idea about the extent of the problem and it is difficult to see how they can give a positive response in those circumstances. I tabled a question in November, asking how
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0787">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 809</span>
many income support claimants spend their personal allowances on meeting fees. I know dozens of people who do that, and so thousands of people throughout the country must also. The reply that I received from the Minister for Social Security was that the Government did not have the necessary information to make an estimate.<br><br>
Having talked to the manager of the Wakefield DSS office, he said that he could find that information if he were required to do so. He knows the extent of the problem. However, the Government do not want to disclose the extent of the problem. I believe that information exists, and the extent of the scandal is such that the Government are covering up by withholding it. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston is right to quote from those surveys. The same position exists in every constituency and in every home. The Government are hiding the problem. However, all hon. Members know from their own backyards that the problem exists and that it is a scandal.<br><br>
I want the Government to respond today by conceding and accepting my hon. Friend's reasonable amendment.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Ann Widdecombe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maidstone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, it is true that I have raised the problem of care not only in the Adjournment debate led by my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Waterside (Mr. Colvin) but on the Consolidated Fund debate before the Christmas adjournment. It was noticeable that two hon. Members entered that debate to raise this specific problem. When it came before the House I subsequently received communications from a large number of colleagues and hon. Members on both sides of the House giving specific incidences of how this matter had caused problems in their constituencies. It causes considerable problems in my constituency and in the south-east in general.<br><br>
For a start, the cost of building and purchasing a building in the south-east is high. That means that the cost of servicing and the interest on loans on such buildings is very high. The proper but nevertheless difficult rises in the interest rate over the past year have not made life simple for those endeavouring to supply care services in the private sector in Maidstone and in the south-east in general.<br><br>
I am particularly exercised by the fact that there seem to be fairly reliable estimates and I shall welcome my hon. Friend the Minister's comments on that. Because of the increasing number of elderly people in the population we shall probably have to expand our provision by about a 40-bed unit every week for the rest of this century if we are to meet the needs of the elderly.<br><br>
If that is true, there is no point in introducing a system where there is a positive disincentive to build and a disincentive to expand. Indeed, almost the only homes in the south-east which can keep their charges anywhere near the level of benefits—and even they have difficulties—are those where no interest is payable on capital and the buildings have been purchased outright. However, there is an obvious disincentive to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 810</span>
expand. The future expansion of nursing and residential homes in the private sector hangs on this question just as greatly as the individual problems experienced by all our constituents.<br><br>
An additional factor has been the entirely and, again, very proper pay award to nurses of an average of 15 per cent. That has had to be fed through and picked up in charges, but the average rise in benefits has been nothing like 15 per cent. Therefore, a deficit is already built in. Once again, we find that the homes that are managing best in the light of this problem are the small homes where the proprietor is a registered nurse and can do much of the work that she would otherwise employ staff to do and thereby save on staffing costs. But that is not possible in a larger home that needs a higher proportion of staff to patients or even in a smaller home where nursing needs are specialised.<br><br>
Care has become difficult because of interest rates and the rise in payments to nurses even before general inflation and other considerations. We find that there is temptation—indeed, there must be—for homes trying to supply a service to cut back on small luxuries like newspapers and small dignities to try to pare costs to survive.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) mentioned Florence Smith at some length. I, too, would like to mention Florence Smith again. I did so in the Consolidated Fund debate, in the Adjournment debate led by my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Waterside and in a recent public session of the Select Committee on Social Services. I asked what would happen to the Florence Smiths of this world when the new system was introduced. What alarmed me was that the Minister gave little comfort by saying that there would be topping up arrangements for new entrants to the system. However, the people now in the system will not benefit from the new arrangements. What will happen to the people already in the system?<br><br>
Florence Smith is 93. Until January 1989 she was cared for in a residential home. Her nursing needs then became so acute that that simply was not possible and she was moved to a nursing home. She was moved to a greatly respected and eminently reasonable nursing home which at that point had managed to keep its charges so low that it charged only a few pounds above the combined benefits level. Therefore, Florence Smith was all right, but within a few weeks that charge—not because of the proprietors' greeds—increased, because of the facts I mentioned. Initially there was a £10 gap. It has since grown. Florence Smith has no assets and only one relation, a daughter. That daughter is herself an old-aged pensioner wholly and completely reliant on the state pension. She has no other assets. What will happen to Florence Smith when the new system is introduced? What will happen to numerous constituents who find themselves in exactly the same position as Florence Smith?<br><br>
I am particularly concerned for the south-east, not because I dismiss this problem elsewhere but because

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 811</span>
of the special cost factors I have mentioned. That problem must be tackled. I hope that the Minister will give some indication that movement will be made on this. If it is not, many Conservative Members will be placed in a difficult position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons why we must discuss income support levels when we discuss this matter comes over clearly from the remarks made by the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe). Probably two thirds or more of the people in residential care and nursing homes are dependent on income support. The national rate for income support has, in effect; become a going rate for the level of provision. The concept of a going rate on a national basis for a level of provision that does not reflect the needs of individuals and the circumstances of neighbourhoods and regions, where cost levels are different, simply cannot work. It will drag the standards down, and that is what has already happened.<br><br>
Still worse, is the fact that to talk about people on income support in this position is to recognise that, before people qualify for income support, all their capital resources, apart from a few thousand pounds, will have gone. Many people will have sold their homes and seen the money being sucked into the costs of their residential care of nursing home provision. At that point, people will have to qualify for income support which is a stressful and painful process for the individual and his family. It can also be of great concern to the provider of care who cannot always be sure that a person will qualify for income support when savings run out.<br><br>
An additional problem is that capital limits for housing benefit and income support are different. We now have an intermediate category of people who will qualify for housing benefit, but not income support, who at a later stage will qualify for income support. Housing benefit brings in the local authority to provide for that period. It is a rigid, cumbersome, confused system.<br><br>
The Government have not taken this opportunity to make the system more sensitive, flexible and fair. They have introduced new rigidities. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) referred to my parliamentary question on the subject. It is crystal clear that in real terms, the value of income support has fallen, especially for those in the high levels of care categories. For example, the mentally ill and mentally handicapped, many of whom are young, require much higher levels of care and supervision than some of the very elderly. The income support rates in those categories have fallen extraordinarily heavily in real terms. This year's social security settlement makes no difference.<br><br>
The figure for November 1985, at May 1989 prices, is £240 per mentally handicapped place. The cash settlement at April 1990, at the new level being provided by the Government, is £215. That does not reflect inflation between May 1989 and April 1990. That is a substantial fall in the financial provision being made through the income support system with all the rigidities that have just been mentioned by the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) about particular regional situations.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 812</span>
There will be two packages of financial provisions, one through the local authority and the other through income support. They will be charged to different sections of Government accounts, one to the social security budget and the other to the budget of the Department of Health. The Government have failed to uprate income support in line with inflation. That will be compounded by the fact that the Department of Social Security will plead in aid of failing to adjust its provision for inflation that there is provision through the Department of Health's budget, which will be administered by local authorities. That means considerable uncertainty for local authorities, residents and the providers of private care. As my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Maidstone said, provision is being topped up somehow: by local authorities, home owners, families when they have the resources to do so, and by voluntary organisations.<br><br>
Strong representations have been made by the Abbeyfield Society in my city. The trust, being of the nature of its management, had difficulty in qualifying for the income support rates because of its philosophy. It pays considerable sums of money, raised by private, charitable operations, to maintain its existing residents. The Abbeyfield Society tries desperately hard not to make the financial resources of prospective residents a test for acceptance. It wants to admit on the basis of social need, but it is under increasing pressure to accept residents who will maximise their financial resources. That situation is familiar to the voluntary sector. Many of the exciting innovations in care for the elderly come from that sector, which suffers from that gap.<br><br>
The consequence of the failure to provide properly through income support is that in some cases levels of care are lowered. There is a worrying change in the pattern of private residential care provision. Until now, the dominant provider has been the owner-occupier. Hon. Members who represent areas with large Edwardian and Victorian terraced house around the centres of cities are familiar with homes for the elderly that are not unlike the family homes alongside them. Their owners live on the premises and run private residential care facilities, often on a small scale. As a result of financial constraints, there is a tendency for such people to give up the homes and go out of business, to be replaced by people who are, in effect, in a big business market.<br><br>
5.45<br><br>
In my city, more and more homes have fallen under the ownership of a subsidiary of Trusthouse Forte and a subsidiary of Vaux Group breweries. It would be regrettable if financial arrangements compelled a change to big business provision of private residential care. It would be a pity to lose the owner occupier, resident manager in private residential care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with what the hon. Gentleman said, especially about the owner occupiers of homes. Does he agree that there is an equal and no less serious danger, that people in difficult circumstances may be dumped out of homes? Their only recourse will be to go back into hospitals, which have many virtues but are likely to be much more expensive for the taxpayer than residential homes.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 813</span>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my next point. A relative of one of my constituents was in Charing Cross hospital, London, suffering from a complex set of physical and mental problems. The ony private residential care facility available was in Wandsworth, at a rate that the family could not sustain because the patient did not qualify for income support. She remained in the Charing Cross hospital's geriatric ward for a further seven months before local authority provision became available in the borough in which she had been a resident.<br><br>
I do not criticise the arrangement in terms of caring for the patient, but as the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) rightly said, in terms of national resources—the cost of providing care—there is no comparison between the two. There is likely to be a squeeze back from residential to hospital care. That was foreshadowed by the Minister's comments about the City road provision when she said that perhaps in the first few days it would come out of hospital contracts. She prefigured the squeeze back into hospital provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So many beds for the elderly, especially long-stay beds, have gone that I doubt whether there are more than half a dozen in my constituency that could be classified as long-stay beds. The provision has largely disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely so. Increasingly, we may find a number of agencies, each with a tight financial remit, playing pass the parcel with the problem.<br><br>
Whatever my reservations about the purchaser-provider relationship when we debated the hospital care parts of the Bill, I should have preferred the adoption of that model for community care. We are left with the customer-provider relationship, which is far less sensitive to the problems mentioned by the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe). It would have been much better if we could have wiped income support from the system and made an agency a proxy for the customer, putting it in the position of purchasing care at whatever costs are relevant to the locality in question. This is what the Government said that they would do, but they have not done it. They have left the basic cost still dependent on income support which, over the past five years, has reduced in value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, this is the second time in the course of a speech, to which I listened attentively because obviously he feels strongly about this important subject, that he has become slightly confused about our proposals.<br><br>
The greater part of his speech related to the present arrangements whereby people are admitted to registered homes and receive income support at the registered home rate from the Department of Social Security. Most of his speech and most of the speeches of other hon. Members related to the existing system. My hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen have spoken about the present level of income support registered home rates through the Department of Social Security. I anticipate that my hon. Friend the Minister for Health will reply that we all understand the problem
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 814</span>
but that it will have to be brought to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, who is responsible for assessing these limits.<br><br>
What I cannot understand is why the hon. Gentleman does not appreciate that the Bill proposes to change the system which he regards, and others appear to regard, as unsatisfactory. For the future, we shall convert to the purchaser-provider arrangement, as he suggests. Each resident will be entitled to income support in the ordinary way, not at the registered home rate, dependent on needs. Each resident will have the ordinary entitlement to housing benefit which is more sensitive to the actual cost of the residential element of the care than income support. The local authority, which is the responsible agency to which we are passing the prime responsibility with almost universal support, will be able to act as a purchaser on behalf of residents. It will negotiate the right rate for all whom it assesses for residential home care, and will pay it. Presumably, it will undertake to pay the proper rate without these difficulties arising.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central says that he finds some attraction in the purchaser-provider system. He finds attraction in the Bill's proposals. We are not passing over responsibilities. My hon Friend and I cannot possibly give detailed replies today on social security points, although we can pass on the questions. What we can say is that, given the widespread discontent with the present system, we propose to change it and go over to precisely the model that my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central recommended.<br><br>
Several hon. Members rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it appears that my contribution is to be a platform for exchanges I am happy to give way to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will bear in mind two self-evident truths. First nothing that the Secretary of State said touches on the position of the 100,000 elderly residents at present in private residential care. Secondly, under clause 38, which was drafted and presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State, local authorities are prevented from assisting those people with the gap between income support and the charges. I hope that my hon. Friend will throw back to the Secretary of State the fair charge that he purports to represent the new funding mechanism as a means of achieving greater value for money by putting in local authority hands funds that would otherwise be spent on income support payments to people in residential care. The extent to which that represents a meaningful and honest transfer of resources is governed by our being honest and meaningful about income support payments. If our amendment is rebutted by the Secretary of State, the Bill will transfer to local authorities the present inadequate income support payments which will not permit them to purchase the same amount of private residential care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing his speech to be used as a platform for exchanges.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 815</span>
First, I deny categorically the allegation that the Government neglected the interests of existing residents of registered homes when we planned the change of policy. We made it plain that existing residents, and future residents under existing arrangements until the new Griffiths policy comes into effect, will be entitled to income support on the present basis. There were fears that some existing residents might be left in uncertainty because of the proposed changes, as people who lived in registered homes and received income support at the registered home level feared that they might be handed over to the possible new uncertainties of the local authority purchaser system when the change came. For that reason, we made it clear when we announced the new policy that we would guarantee to all who were residents under the existing system before the change took place that they would continue to be entitled to income support at the registered home rate thereafter, and for as long as necessary.<br><br>
I appreciate the underlying anxiety in the debate about the adequacy of income support. I and my hon. Friend the Minister for Health have listened sympathetically. The Government's policy carries the plain implication that income support for existing registered home dwellers will from time to time be reviewed to take account of cost. That is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security. We shall pass on to him the representations received today about the adequacy of income support.<br><br>
It has been said that we have not given local authorities the right to top up. It would be a complete shambles if existing and future residents found themselves on income support that was frozen at present rates, or moved a little, and the local authority then decided that it wanted to top up on top of that, if we gave it the necessary powers. It is much better for there to be a clear distinction, with existing residents catered for under the present arrangements, my right hon. Friend answerable for the rate at which he sets income support, and new residents receiving the benefits that I described.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) asked a second question about how we will assess future finance. I hear what he says, but he knows that we have said repeatedly that future financing for the new system will have to be considered, along with all the other community claims, in this autumn's public spending round. It will, in part, be derived from a transfer of funds from income support, based on an estimate of what the cost would have been if the old system had continued and, in part, on an estimate of the growth of demand and the cost of the new system. That is a wholly separate issue. The cost of the new arrangements, an issue which the debate seems to have raised, will be more flexible to local conditions, more closely attuned to the needs of individual clients and their families, and an improvement on the present system.<br><br>
It is a mistake to mix the two systems. The hon. Gentleman seems to make the mistake that the amendment makes. He thinks that the old system of income
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 816</span>
support at registered home rate will continue. It will not. Meanwhile, there is the guarantee that existing residents will continue on the basis on which they were admitted, using income support upvalued, as the Government judge it right, from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael).</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend allow me to pinpoint the Secretary of State's attempt to abrogate responsibility and claim that some of these matters were for the Secretary of State for Social Security? Questions seeking to tease out information about what is to happen have been transferred from the Secretary of State for Social Security to the Secretary of State for Health. It is clear that the Secretary of State for Social Security believes that the implementation of the White Paper is not a matter for him and that the buck stops in front of the Minister in this Committee. The answers to my hon. Friend's questions should be given in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. May I say, for the record, that this is probably one of the longest speeches that I have ever made, but I have made very little of it myself.<br><br>
We now seem to be teasing out some of the difficulties in the new system and the old. Each system has its defects. It is clear that all the rigidities of the existing system and all the under-financing of the past five years will continue into indefinitely because it is fixed on the people who are benefiting from it now. We have just discovered that some of the deficiencies and under-financing of the existing system will continue in the new system, because the latest set of income support rates are to be used as the basis of local authority financing under the new system.<br><br>
Inflation may not be a good guide because additional forms of care are now available—we want them to be available—but it has been going down for five years. Falling inflation rates are, however, to be used as the basic building blocks of the new system to transfer resuurces to the Department of Health and then on to local authorities. That is why we are worried. The income support rate will remain a fundamental building block of both the new and the old systems, and we want an assurance that that rate will be right.<br><br>
It would have been better to abolish the rate and hand over the whole sum, with anything else that was necessary, to local authorities, but that is not to happen. The Government have decided to make a split between the cost of care and that of keep. It will be a difficult and complicated operation, shrouded in uncertainty, to stitch back together the package of provision so that care and keep are brought back into relationship.<br><br>
It is natural that local authorities are worried that the rates have gone down steadily in real terms over the past five years. It is natural that they are worried at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0791">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 817</span>
prospect of being faced with moral and legal responsibilities that they are wholly unable to meet. We shall debate some of their worries when we come to ring-fencing provision to local authorities.<br><br>
The only way in which we can deal sensibly with the problems described by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) is to have a single agency to which we can say, "Where is the money coming from?". The Secretary of State is perpetuating a split between social security and health and, for all the advances in care, we can see the money disappearing into a hole in the system, with local authorities being left, apparently, with the responsibility.<br><br>
That is our worry. The old residential care rate and nursing home rate is to remain in the system, bringing with it all the under-financing and staggering reduction in provision in real terms of the past five years. It is to be the basic benchmark of the Secretary of State's new initiative, and that worries us. We know what has happened in the past and we are looking for something better in the future, but the exchanges in this debate fill us with no optimism about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) gave a fair summary of the situation. There has been a growth in the number of people in residential care receiving income support and, as he said, they may have passed the means test, but not what one might describe as the care test. The problem was tackled by Griffiths, and as my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State said, the Bill deals with exactly that problem, but deals with it for the future.<br><br>
The amendment is unusual, in that it relates not to what is in the Bill but to what is not in the Bill. As my right hon. and learned Friend pointed out a short time ago, people in residential homes receiving income support will continue under the existing system and will remain there after the Government's proposals come into force.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Livingston concentrated on private residential homes—by implication, those making a profit; some make a somewhat modest profit, even if others do better—but the problem applies also to non-profit making homes, voluntary organisations and charitable homes, particularly those that offer residential accommodation with nursing care. I think, in particular, of the Cheshire Homes, of which there is one in my constituency. I have details of a number of sad cases.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned Bromley, where we have a number of residential homes, and I know of many distressing cases similar to the ones of which we have heard, with families having to top up the difference between the charges and the benefits received. That may not be unreasonable, if the family is fairly well placed and the amount to be paid is relatively modest, but when the family has young children, as often happens when an elderly relative is involved, the means are simply not there to fill the gap. I know of some families that have to beg from a variety of benevolent bodies for £10 a week here and £10 a week there. In one case the Cheshire Homes literally has to subsi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 818</span>
dise the resident, because there is no way that it will turn the person out on to the street.<br><br>
As I said, I have the evidence. It is at least 12 months since I brought these cases to the attention of the Department of Social Security. I was assured by the then Secretary of State that such matters were carefully monitored and that, from the information that it had, the Department was satisified that the rates were fair. I assured the Department that that was not so, and was asked for my evidence. I sent a large amount of evidence and was eventually thanked for my help in considering all the implications of the Griffiths report, the Government's response to which I was assured, would address the problem. The Government have addressed the problem, but their response does not deal with existing cases. It is clear that the Government do not intend to change the structure of payments for people in residential homes who already receive income support. I understand why and I understand the argument of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State about the difficulties that would arise if the structure were changed, and how worrying it would be for existing residents, but what do the Government intend to do to improve the lot of residents? My hon. Friend the Minister for Health was asked that question when she appeared before the Select Committee, and she made it clear that her Department had no plans to deal with the problem. It may not fall within the scope of the Department of Health—though from what we heard earlier there seems to be some doubt about that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had satisfactorily examined the issues involved and they did not relate to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the income support that is paid to people who are already in homes and which will continue to be paid to them is the responsibility of the Department of Social Security. The Secretary of State for Social Security also appeared before the Select Committee, and when my hon. Friends the Members for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) and for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) and I cross-examined him, we got little change—literally and metaphorically. He did not say that the system would be changed.<br><br>
The problem may not apply equally throughout the country, although the argument of the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) suggested otherwise. I accept that it may apply to few cases—I do not claim that all the residents of every home suffer in that way. There may be something in the argument that a blanket increase in income support is not a good use of resources, but something must be done to help existing residents, and it will be not only in their interests.<br><br>
To follow up an earlier argument, I understand that when the Bill is implemented a calculation will be made about the total income support paid to people in residential homes in, say, Bromley, Wakefield, Livingston or Maidstone. That lump sum, which I hope will be ring-fenced, will be transferred to the local authority to be used for people in residential homes. But, as has already been shown, if that sum is inadequate now when it comes out of one of the Government's pockets, it will still be inadequate when it comes out of a different pocket. The problem must be addressed. It may not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 819</span>
be the immediate responsibility of my right hon. and hon. Friends on the front Bench, but they surely have influence in the corridors of power, and I urge them to use it.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because many of my arguments have been expressed well by other hon. Members.<br><br>
The Secretary of State spoke about the shortfall when he intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins). The Minister said that it would have to be brought to the attention of the Secretary of State for Social Security. The responsibility for elderly people who need residential care lies with the Secretary of State for Health. It depresses me that he thinks it is another Secretary of State's responsibility. If it is someone else's responsibility, it has been largely ignored until now.<br><br>
The shortfall has caused human tragedy. I shall describe three cases from my constituency. One elderly lady, who had been in a home for two or three years, found herself, like Florence Smith, with a £10 gap. Her spending money was taken away. Ownership of the home changed hands and the new proprietor took her spending money without consulting her relatives. It would not have made a difference if the relatives had been consulted, because there was only an unemployed single daughter who had health problems of her own. It proved difficult to move the woman to a cheaper home because they locked the door on the daughter each time she went to the home.<br><br>
Another constituent had to be moved to a cheaper home because of a shortfall. It made him most distressed because he had been in what he regarded as his home. Both cases have been brought to the attention of Ministers.<br><br>
Another woman faced with the prospect of being moved, had a £30 gap; that is a lot in my constituency, which is a very low-pay area. The gap has been met by her daughter and son-in-law, at great cost because they do not have much money.<br><br>
It is not good enough for a Secretary of State for Health to pass the buck. The Government's policy has wasted money and resources. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) spelt out at length and with much clarity what has happened over the past 10 years, when private provision has been forced on people. There has been massive institutionalisation, but no assessment. People have been moved out of geriatric wards, which have been taken over for other uses. Local authorities would have provided a package for elderly people to stay at home or to have half care, which would have been a better use of money.<br><br>
We now face a problem. Roughly 100,000 people are in care. Many of them are caught in the money gap that the Government have created. The least that the Secretary of State can do is to address that problem and make up the shortfall in money. Since 1985, the Government have had the deliberate policy of not uprating benefits to a realistic level.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 820</span>
It has been suggested that proprietors are cutting costs where they can. Many proprietors will cut costs in the wrong areas. Many will not cut their profits and many cannot cut their mortgages, or heating bills. They will therefore reduce staff and food. That is bad for the elderly residents of the home. If proprietors go down that road, care will get even worse. The Government are unwilling to provide even the protection afforded by our amendments on regional inspectorates. The Secretary of State has a clear responsibility to tell me and the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widde-combe) what will happen to the shortfall facing elderly people in those homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we have this debate about resources before the public expenditure survey round in the autumn when allocations are made to local authorities for the implementation of this policy. We must not duck the important question of resources.<br><br>
The dilemma facing Conservative Members is simple. The White Paper "Caring for People" sets out clear objectives, for example:
<br><blockquote><p>"This offers the prospect of a better deal for people who need care and for those who provide care."</p></blockquote>
A key objective is:
<br><blockquote><p>"to promote the development of a flourishing independent sector alongside good quality public services."</p></blockquote>
We all agree with those objectives. The difficulty arises when one asks oneself whether paragraphs 8.22, 8.23 and 8.24 which summarise how the policy will be financed, will enable the Government to achieve those objectives. Nowhere in the White Paper is there the recognition that the existing level of income support is inadequate. That is common knowledge on both sides of the Committee. In those three key paragraphs there is no recognition of the deficiency of the present system.<br><br>
According to paragraph 8.23, four blocks will be taken into account to build up the resources given to the local authorities. The first block is the income support that would have been payable under the present system, and which hon. Members on both sides have criticised. The second is normal income support and housing benefit, which is fine, but it does not cover caring costs. Then there is the continuing commitment to residents with preserved rights. My hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) made the valid point that we shall carry forward the present inequity for people who are subsidised by other residents, by the residential home owner or by relatives. Then there is the fourth block, with which I do not disagree, which simply refers to the rate at which new people move into the system.<br><br>
We need realism. If we are to have a new regime, let us move away from fiction and start with fact. The transfer from social security to local authorities will have to be at a far higher level than the present provision in the public expenditure survey, otherwise the scheme will be a non-starter. Before the public expenditure survey bid this autumn the Secretary of State for Social Security must recognise that the present system is deficient and make good the shortfall by switching

resources over. Otherwise, next year, when the system starts, clients with preserved rights will continue to get inadequate help from income support.<br><br>
The problem with new clients will arise because local authorities will start shopping around and buying in contracts. Clearly, the contracts that they buy will be at a realistic level, not at income support level. We heard from the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) what the going rates are. If we simply take the four building blocks and move resources over on that basis, compensation for contracts will not be at a realistic level. They will simply be based on the income support that is payable under the present scheme. Under .the new regime the existing people will continue to be underfinanced, but so will the new people. One cannot move over to a brave new world, unless one is honest about the fact that it will cost a great deal of money. Without a great deal of money the scheme will not work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to enter a minor caveat in the debate. The amendment seeks to bridge the gap between state expenditure and market requirements. While I accept that that gap should be bridged, I am not eager to support the principle that the market price, which is dependent on such considerations as profitability, should determine income support rates. I accept that there will be areas where impressive provision is made and where owners of homes for the elderly do not make exorbitant profits, but because of the lack of regional variation in payments, in other areas there might be great demand for few places in homes. Market prices will be driven up, resulting in exorbitant profits.<br><br>
I am not sure whether market prices can be capped. The Government might investigate that when determining the extent to which the gap can be bridged. Local authorities entering into contracts, or the Department of Health under existing arrangements, could generalise the market price payable for places in homes subsidised by either income support or local authority payments. I have never much favoured unrestrained free market determination of the price payable, which leaves the state simply to meet the price that the market decides. Nothing that I have said prevents my supporting amendment No. 592 because the amendment meets my demands. However, the Committee should be aware of setting the dangerous precedent of allowing the market, meaning existing residential care home owners, to determine state expenditure.<br><br>
In 1987, the National Audit Office produced an interesting report on the subject of community care development. I advise hon. Members to read part 5, which covers residential care for the elderly. The report is perhaps the most meaningful statement on this subject. It sets out the problems that have confronted the Department of Health in generating new community care policies. The report stated that the Government have changed the rules several times since 1980 when they realised that they were in an open-budget situation. I do not like using that term which was so often derided by <i>Private Eye.</i><br><br>
If during the public expenditure survey, the Secretary of State is to press his Cabinet colleagues for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 822</span>
additional resources—which I understand are to be handed to another Secretary of State—he might consider whether the market price can be determined so that the gap can be bridged in the way proposed in the amendment, without Government expenditure getting out ofhand.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been extremely interesting in at least two ways. First, there has been remarkable consensus about the difficulties, inadequacies and shortcomings of the present system. I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) set out those shortcomings with particular eloquence. Her message was echoed effectively by everyone who spoke. That consensus is unusual in any proceedings of the House in almost any context and it is right to draw attention to it.<br><br>
I thought, however, that the purpose of our debate was not so much to consider the existing position, inadequate or otherwise, as to decide how amendment No. 592 represents an adequate solution to the problems. I might have been naive in my thinking, but that was my impression. I hope that it will not be considered tactless of me if I focus on the wording of that amendment.<br><br>
Secondly, there has been a striking reluctance, particularly by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) who tabled the amendment and his supporters, to speak to their amendment. I fully understand and sympathise with the Labour party's difficulty in seeing the amendment as a serious contribution to the solution of the important national problem that we are discussing.<br><br>
Amendment No. 592 qualifies as one of the more sloppy, ill-thought-out pieces of work that have been presented to the Committee so far. It is unclear whether the amendment attempts to address the continuing difficulties that will affect the 100,000 people currently enjoying income support in registered homes or the post-Griffiths arrangements that the Government have incorporated in the Bill.<br><br>
When I first read the amendment, I supposed that, because it referred to the Secretary of State determining the aggregate level of payment required across the country, it must apply to the present position. I then looked to see where it was intended to insert the amendment in the Bill and realised that it was intended for the new arrangements, which made no sense.<br><br>
Another problem is that the amendment is ambiguously worded. It states:<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall certify that he is satisfied… that income Support at the registered homes rates"</p></blockquote>
—again referring to the present, not the new position, despite the fact that the amendment is to be incorporated in clause 37—<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"is adequate to meet such charges in residential care homes… as he considers reasonable."</p></blockquote>
That is ambiguous and sloppy wording. Does that mean that the Secretary of State will establish a prescribed level of support? If that support is above the cost level of even the more expensive homes, it will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0794">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 823</span>
regarded as a level to which all homes should rapidly increase their prices. If it is below the cost level of certain homes, the difficulties which we discussed this afternoon will continue in that many residents do not have the resources to meet the prices charged by the homes.<br><br>
New clauses (2A) and (2B) in amendment No. 592, if taken together, would mean that after carrying out the annual review to determine the annual increase in the cost of homes, the Secretary of State could raise income support to take account of that increase. The effect of the amendment would be to underwrite whatever the homes charged, by giving them what amounts to a blank cheque.<br><br>
I made similar strictures in previous debates. The hon. Member for Livingston has little sense of financial responsibility. The formula in the amendment would be an engine of infinite inflation of the cost of residential or nursing care in private homes. It would be an invitation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wish to hear the hon. Gentleman and that is becoming increasingly difficult. I ask members of the Committee who wish to conduct conversations to do so outside the Committee Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a feeling that I am really hitting the mark when the noise level on the Opposition Benches rises. Labour Members do not appreciate what I say and I am, therefore, greatly encouraged by that response.<br><br>
The amendment would mean that residential and nursing care here would become analogous with that in the United States after the introduction of the Medicare programmes when the public purse was ripped off by private providers of care. It is ironic that the Labour party should table such a proposal. I attribute that to the rather too rapid drafting of the amendment. More reflection would have been in order.<br><br>
We should consider our common ground. We agree that there is a problem—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish to have to remind the Committee again that hon. Members should maintain a reasonable degree of silence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a general reluctance to take the amendment seriously. We can therefore assume that even the Labour party does not believe that it is a solution to the problem.<br><br>
The Government's proposals are on the right lines for three reasons. First, giving a role to local authorities will ensure that the level of financial support will not be considered nationally, as it is at present, but on a regional and local basis. That will take account of the wide disparity in the cost of providing care, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and others have alluded.<br><br>
Secondly, I welcome the role of local authorities because they will carry out the essential care test recommended in the Griffiths proposals. That is just as important, if not more important, than the means test. It was ungracious of the hon. Member for Livingston,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 824</span>
who raised the issue of the care test, not to refer to the fact that that concept is incorporated in the Bill.<br><br>
The care test is important not merely because it may save unnecessary expenditure on residential care for those who do not need it, but because it is in the interests of individuals that they should be kept at home when possible. It is axiomatic that most people prefer to live, and to die, in their own homes rather than in institutional care.<br><br>
Local authorities are responsible for social services and therefore must supply the support necessary to keep people in their own homes. The principle of the care test is that it is better to keep people at home rather than to push them automatically into institutional accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have spent a great deal of time discussing the amendments bemoaning the serious shortcomings of the existing system. Report after report—including Griffiths—has made it clear that the substantial resources that have been spent on private residential homes have not always been spent in the most sensible, wise or productive manner. The proposal seeks to ensure that when the resources are allocated, the individual's needs are properly assessed. Few of us believe that the perverse incentive under the present regime is in the best interests of the individual, the carer or the taxpayer, in terms of value for money.<br><br>
We propose a clearer system. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) is right. There is a lack of clarity and a misconception in the amendment about the future regime. In future, the needs and means of residents will be assessed. They will receive income support and housing benefit, as my right hon. and learned Friend said. The local authority will find them a place in a residential home which they will secure by using their own purchasing power.<br><br>
We discussed what would happen to those who remain under the present regime. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee expressed anxiety about them. My hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) spoke on the subject recently in an Adjournment debate, when my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security replied.<br><br>
I endorse what the Secretary of State said, forcefully, on the issue. We have made it clear throughout that those who remain under the present regime will be the responsibility of the DSS. On 1st April 1991, local authorities will assume responsibility for all those who need domiciliary or residential care. Local authorities will have a considerable task in that first year. They will have to set up assessment procedures and to ensure that contracting procedures are in place and available to provide the necessary services for new people entering the system. If we gave local authorities responsibility for existing residents, it would give them an enormous task in addition to that which we have already entrusted to them.<br><br>
We all agree that it should be entrusted to local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled by my hon. Friend's argument, so perhaps she could explain it to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0795">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 825</span>
me. Those who are in the system have already been assessed de facto, if not under the new system. They are in nursing homes because they have nursing rather than residential needs. Their needs have already been defined. They are a declining population, unlike those who will come in in future. Why cannot the new system apply to them and accept, for simplicity's sake, their existing situation as an assessment?</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a point about nursing homes. People in residential homes have had an assessment of their means, but not' of their needs. That is an aspect of the present regime that needs revision. We have been clear throughout that when the Bill comes into force the position of all those in residential homes will be protected. They need not feel in jeopardy, that their needs will be reassessed or that they will not be eligible under the new criteria for the residential care to which they have become accustomed. People who are in residential care on 1st April 1991 will keep their entitlements, whether or not my right hon. and learned Friend or I feel that that is the right way to care for them. We shall also make regulations to provide exemptions, which will include the younger disabled, who benefit from the current top-ping-up regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has confused me. Present entitlements will be preserved, but if they are now insufficient, how will that help?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only those who are receiving help from social security with their fees will have their entitlement preserved, but those who are in residential homes. The nub of the argument, time and again—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a corrrect statement, and she is entitled to put it into the pot. However, it does not answer the question that she was asked. She said that it is important that people who are in residential care on income support should not feel in jeopardy, but tens of thousands do feel in jeopardy because the charge is well in excess of income support. What is the point of offering a preserved state if the level is ludicrously inadequate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made the point, which has been made by many members of the Committee, that many people feel under pressure from the present regime of income support limits for those in residential care. I urge my hon. Friends to refer to the debate on that, which was answered by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Social security. She spoke about the background to social security support for those in residential homes and about the extra £100 million that will be provided this year to assist that group. She also explained that when the Department of Social Security, takes decisions it looks into a wide range of issues, including costs. It listens to representations from Age Concern and many other groups including the National Federation of Housing Associations. This is clearly that Department's responsibility. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, we shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
ensure that it is aware of the worries that the Committee has expressed, but it is wrong to argue that because there are shortcomings in the present regime, the regime that we are installing is flawed. That is not a valid argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister respond to the point that I made in my way, and the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) made in his, that the Secretary of State conceded in his intervention that it is precisely the present income support rates that are to be the basis of the financial allocations to local authorities under the new system? That is why we fear that the existing inadequate levels of provision will be transferred to the new system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is moving on to a slightly different point that I hoped to come to, which was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing. Acton (Sir G. Young). The hon. Gentleman is referring to the financing of the new regime. We have said time and again that adequate resources will be available for local authorities to undertake these tasks.<br><br>
We have made it clear that the social security money we anticipate, taking demographic factors into account, will be trasferred to local authorities. Also, local authorities—I have had many discussions with them—will make representations in the unsual way about various aspects of the proposals in "Caring for People" and in the Bill. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) Spoke about the provision of residential care, but there may be other aspects in terms of costs for inspection units, for example. That is part and parcel of the hon. Gentleman's point about the implications of the Bill.<br><br>
What is fundamentally misconceived is the argument that, because of the difficulties of the present regime, the new regime will be flawed. It is important for local authorities to make headway on the many tasks that we are already discussing with them, including inspection units, assessment, complaints procedures and many other mechanisms, to ensure that in the first year of the new regime the 100,000 people in the previous system will be offered the necessary services.<br><br>
It is not only the principle of protecting those in the existing system to ensure that the message is conveyed to those responsible for income limits at the Department of Social Security which is causing deep concern to members of the Committee; it is also important to ensure that those responsible for the new system can concentrate their tasks, resources and endeavours to make it a great success.<br><br>
Local authorities welcome the responsibilities with which they are being entrusted. I was in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) the other day. We were well aware of the efforts being made to ensure that new people coming into the system will have their needs properly met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there any way in which the Minister believes that government can influence the full market price?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When local authorities undertake the task—that was one of the issues discussed in my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0796">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 827</span>
hon. Friend's constituency—there is no doubt that, with their purchasing power, there will be areas where they can obtain price advantages in contracts. That is one area of development for local authorities, preparing for their responsibilities for purchasing, to find out where advantages can be gained. One point put to me by the individual responsible for trying to achieve best value in finding places in residential homes was that some private homes try to write off their capital costs over a short period. Under the new regime, local authorities will be able to examine, and to ensure that they have all the facts they need to obtain best value when they place their contracts.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's local authority also said that one advantage was that it could ensure regularity of commitment, and that some private homes will find it an advantage to have their places taken up by a local authority, possibly at a cheaper rate, if they are sure of that predictability and continuity.<br><br>
Those are two practical and good examples of the way in which local authorities, under the new purchasing system, can use that influence to achieve good value. The system of purchasing and built-in quality control is in line with the discussions that have taken place with the guidance that will be issued to local authorities. We want to ensure that local authorities are well prepared to undertake their new tasks.<br><br>
I understand only too well the worries that have been voiced by members of the Committee about the existing regime of income limits. I profoundly believe that this system will not be helped by a requirement on local authorities to take responsibility for all those who are currently in residential homes. The task that we are imposing on local authorities is big enough. What we propose is a good framework. Great strides can be made forward, but not by taking on additional responsibility for the existing residents. The existing residents must remain the responsibility of the Department of Social Security, and I shall pass on to our colleagues in that Department forcefully the views that have been expressed in Committee today.<br><br>
I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendments, because they will not help the future establishment of care in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to speak even more briefly than on the last occasion when I was caught by the bell, in order that we can have a Division, because I sense that the Committee is ready to reach a conclusion. I want to say a brief word about the amendments that have been impugned by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies).<br><br>
Amendment No. 591 applies solely to people under the present system who will continue under the preserved rights. Regrettably, as it is an amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
to a later clause, we shall not have an opportunity to vote on it until much later tonight.<br><br>
Amendment No. 592 certainly goes wider than people at present under the existing system. It provides a trigger and it means that the new arrangements will not be triggered until income support reaches an adequate level. Obviously, the trigger can also act as a lever, because if it is the trigger that has to be pulled before the new arrangements come into force, it is also a lever on the Department of Social Security to provide a realistic level of income support by April 1991.<br><br>
I have heard only three arguments against the amendment and they do not commend themselves to many of us, including Conservative Members. The first argument was that this is not the right Department on which to lay a share of the responsibility. That may be true, but we cannot ignore a serious problem on such a basis. It is perfectly in order to deal with the matter in the Bill and it should be dealt with in the Bill.<br><br>
Secondly, it has been suggested that the new system will .abolish the problem. That is not true. The new system will build the problem into the new structure. The Minister for Health said that local authorities can use their purchasing powers to purchase residential care. They can, but unless the Bill is amended their purchasing power will partly turn on that inadequate level of income support.<br><br>
Finally, the main reason for supporting the amendments is that the new structure does nothing whatever for people trapped in the old system. It does nothing to assist Florence Smith. I am not asking for topping-up arrangements to assist Florence Smith; I am asking for a realistic level of income support to assist Florence Smith. The present system is not fair to her and it is not fair to the private owners who have to subsidise the Florence Smiths. For once, the Committee has an opportunity to strike a blow for fairness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way extremely briefly to the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to say that many Conservative Members wholly agree with the sentiments that the hon. Gentleman has just uttered, but we do not believe that his amendment is the right way to solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the hon. Gentleman should have tabled his own amendment. It is now time for the Committee to divide and I shall allow it to do so.</span></p>
