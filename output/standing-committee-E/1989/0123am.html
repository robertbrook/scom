<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I notice that amendment No. 412, which I tabled, is not included in the list of amendments selected for debate. I do not wish to comment on your selection of amendments, but I seek your guidance on whether my amendment is in order, and could therefore be considered for selection.<br><br>
The amendment would exclude Wales from the provisions of clause 5, which deals with the setting up of NHS trusts. My argument is that Wales and England should be considered as different legal entities, and that Wales could, therefore, be excluded from the clause. The Bill contains clauses that deal with Wales separately from England, but it has been suggested to me that I have no authority to table an amendment that would exclude Wales from either the whole, or any part of, the Bill. I should like you, Dame Janet, to consider three or four points in support of my contention that such an amendment would be in order.<br><br>
There is a precedent in Standing Committee H, which considered the Licensing Bill in 1987. In column 257 of the <i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings of that Standing Committee, the Chair accepted for debate an amendment to leave out Wales from the Bill. The preamble to the Welsh Language Act 1967, states that Wales should be distinguished from England in the interpretation of future Acts of Parliament. Schedule 1 of the Interpretation Act 1978 also distinguishes Wales from England by defining Wales, for the first time, as a separate legal entity. I shall make sure, Dame Janet, that you receive copies of the documents to which I refer, so that you can consider your ruling.<br><br>
It has been further suggested to me that an amendment to exclude Wales from the whole of the Bill would be in order, but that an amendment to exclude Wales from part of the Bill only would not. That seems strange. I do not seek to exclude Wales entirely from the Bill, especially as we shall later consider the community care provisions.<br><br>
I ask you, Dame Janet, not to give your ruling this morning, because I know that you will need time to reflect on what I have said, but to give the Committee guidance, and to consider whether an amendment to exclude Wales from any part of the Bill would be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for the courteous and thoughtful way in which he has presented his point of order. Committee Members will know that one of the powers of the Chairman is to select amendments without being called upon to state reasons. As I have said before, the selection list of amendments is always provisional. I shall carefully consider the points that the hon. Member has made and make an announcement later, probably at the beginning of the afternoon sitting.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Dame Janet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Hayes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I seek guidance on a question of privilege regarding the Committee's conduct; it relates to the attempted intimidation of Committee Members. As you are well aware, Dame Janet, that is a serious matter. On page 157, "Erskine May" cites the PlimsolFs case and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Publishing statements impugning the conduct of Members and threatening them with further exposure if they took part in the debates of the House"</p></blockquote>
is a matter of grave concern. During a previous sitting I drew attention to the conduct of the hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) and was rightly ruled out of order. You said, Dame Janet, that the hon. Member was entitled to make notes. Over the weekend, Conservative Members of the Committee have been in contact with our local media as a result of misleading press releases issued by the hon. Lady.<br><br>
Worse, amendment No. 292 which stands in the name of the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends is another example of intimidation. The amendment seeks not to amend the Bill, sensibly, but to mislead the public and coerce hon. Members to vote contrary to their intentions. Is that a matter for you, Dame Janet, or for the Privileges Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter for me. If the hon. Member wants to pursue the point it must be taken to the Speaker. I hope that Committee members will not descend to making unpleasant imputations about each other. It has always been my privilege to preside over Committees in which hon. Members have treated one another with reasonable courtesy, even if they have felt a bit hot under the collar, and however hard-hitting the arguments were. I hope that my longstanding Committee chairmanship record will not be broken in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Ms. Harriet Harman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. The issues before the Committee are of the utmost seriousness and involve all our constituents —represented by both Labour and Conservative Members. Last week, Conservative Members voted to deny their constituents guaranteed access to local services and the choice of where to go for treatment. In doing so they trampled on the rights and interests of their constituents. Constituents are entitled to know the actions that have been taken in the Committee by their Members of Parliament.<br><br>
It is wrong for Members of Parliament to attend to their correspondence while their constituents' interests and views are trampled on. The reason why the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) raised that bogus point of order is that he knows that his constituents do not like what he is doing, and he hopes to do it in secret. I shall carry on informing people about what their Members of Parliament are doing in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that that is not a point of order for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order made by the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), Dame Janet. I draw your attention to a press release issued in the name of the hon. Member which caused me distress last week. It gives a report of the proceedings of the Committee that I believe will not accord with your recollection of it. The press release is dated 16 January and is headed:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Committee MPs Welcome GPs Charter"</p></blockquote>
It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Patient Care will be improved and doctors' choice and influence increased once the National Health Service Bill becomes law.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This is the view of MPs currently closely studying the NHS and Community Care Bill during its Committee Stage in the Commons. MPs serving on the standing committee … have welcomed its provisions to improve patient care and called the Bill a 'GPs Charter'."</p></blockquote>
Three quotes from "Committee MPs" follow, none of which I could find in the Official Report and one of which is attributed to an hon. Member who has made no contribution to our proceedings. The device that the hon. Member for Harlow has adopted is clear. He is using the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"Committee MPs Welcome 'GPs' Charter"</p></blockquote>
in the hope that sub-editors and the public will read it as "MPs' Committee Welcome GPs Charter". It is designed to give the public and the press the impression that we have discussed a matter that we have not discussed, that we have reached a conclusion that we have not reached and that members of the Committee have said things that they have not said.<br><br>
Were the article produced by a member of the press, we should no doubt sigh and say that it was part of the traditional misunderstanding between the press and the Department of Health. It is a matter of note that a member of the Committee has chosen so flagrantly to misrepresent what the Committee has discussed.<br><br>
I did not raise the matter last Thursday when the press release came into my hands because I take the robust view that hon. Members should stand by their press releases and defend them in the cut and thrust of their dealing with the press outside this Place rather than seek the protection of the Chair. But, as the hon. Member for Harlow has raised the matter of somebody else's press release, I suggest that before drawing attention to any spots he detects in the eye of my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) he contemplate the mote in his own eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What members say outside the Committee is not a matter for the Chair or a matter to be raised as a point of order before the Committee. I will not allow this to continue. I am extremely displeased and I wish us to continue with the matters under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Yesterday, the Public Accounts Committee took evidence from Mr. Nichol, accounting officer of the Department, and from Treasury official, Mr. Beastall. In the light of information that I had received I asked Mr. Beastall whether it was true that Treasury officials were anxious about the financial implications of the Bill. He found it difficult to answer my question clearly. As Treasury officials are worried could a Treasury Minister—and there is precedent for this—be asked to attend the Committee so that we may question him on the Bill's implications for the Treasury. The view of the Treasury, as I understand it, is that costs will escalate as a result of the Bill and thus impede growth in patient care and services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has no power to summon anyone. If the hon. Member wants to raise the matter, it is best raised on a relevant clause or amendment. It is not a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. I understand that under a procedural arrangement the Attorney-General has been asked to attend the Standing Committee considering the Property Services Agency and Crown Suppliers Bill, to deal with a legal matter. Perhaps that should be checked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the other way round. If the Attorney-General wishes to attend, he does so. It is not up to a Committee to summon him.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. Will the Secretary of State discuss the matter with a Treasury Minister and ask him to apply to attend the Committee, so that we can deal with the matter? The Treasury is deeply worried about the financial implications of the Bill, which it feels are open-ended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My immediate recollection, which I shall have to check, is that only the Law Officers have the right to attend, if they so choose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:On a point of order, Dame Janet. I confirm that I am in full agreement with my Treasury colleagues both on the policies that lie behind the Bill and on their financial implications. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that his fear that the Treasury is disturbed by the spending implications of the Bill are unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. James Couchman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I agree with the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). The issuing of overenthusiastic press releases in constituencies other than one's own is to be utterly deprecated. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) issued a press release which gives a distorted view—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled on that matter. I feel very firmly about it, and I am not prepared to take further discussion upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I want to make a rather mundane point about <i>Hansard's</i> accuracy.<br><br>
Last Thursday, during the Committee's debate on amendment 189 to clause 4, I discussed health care. <i>Hansard</i> quotes me as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) had not the least grasp of why most people are are against private care."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 18 January 1990; c. 237.]</p></blockquote>
That is rather embarrassing for me. I actually referred to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie), who was Under-Secretary of State for Heath when the Health and Medicines Bill was in Committee. I have pointed out the error to Hansard, but I am anxious to have the correction placed on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter so courteously. I am sure that Hansard will note the mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. In column 236 of the reoport of our proceedings last Thursday, I mentioned the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), so the correction suggested by the hon. Member for Wakefield would make nonsense of the whole proceedings. My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
had not been mentioned in the Committee, and had no relevance to the debate at all. In the context of the Committee's proceedings, it does not make sense to claim that my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South was being referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. As usual, I am at a loss to understand the hon. Member's contribution. I referred to a debate that took place during the Standing Committee stage of the Health and Medicines Bill, and to the views on private care of the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South. It was a specific reference, but unfortunately the constituency was incorrectly recorded by <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>

NHS CONTRACTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Robin Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The Opposition do not propose to move amendments Nos. 237, 286 and 288.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 5, line 6, after 'agreed,' insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) that the terms and conditions of a proposed arrangement may not be in the public interest; or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(d) that in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed arrangement, sufficient regard has not been had by the prospective parties to the proposed arrangement to the interests of patients;'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I apologise to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), but I am interested to hear what the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has to say. I know that my performance on Thursday night in attempting to speak to the right amendment was not one of my strongest points—but amendment No. 286 is in my name, not his.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Robin Cook</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to expedite the Committee's business, but if the hon. Member wishes to move the amendment I shall be happy to let him do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) wishes to move his amendment. Mr. Kennedy, the floor is yours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Dame Janet. I thank the hon. Member for Livingston for his indulgence, and I beg to move amendment No. 286, in page 4, line 41, after 'party', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'of any individual who is about to receive, is receiving or has received, goods or services under the arrangement,'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 288, in page 5, line 33, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(()) Where a reference under subsection 3 above is made by an individual, the Secretary of State, or as the case may be, the person appointed under subsection (5) above, may direct either or both of the parties to the arrangement in question to make payments by way of compensation to that individual; and it shall be the duty of the parties to comply with that direction.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment emanated from the Royal College of Nursing. Clause 4 establishes the contract system for the delivery of health care and an arbitration procedure, through the Secretary of State, to resolve disputes arising from contracts.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
Anxiety has been expressed that such a system will operate essentially between health managers, with no formal or guaranteed input from the consumer. The amendment would enable consumers as well as parties to the contract to have recourse to the Secretary of State through arbitration. It would allow consumers to enforce a contract if, for example, standards fell below prescribed specifications. That is the nuts and bolts of the amendment. The matter has caused professional concern among the RCN and others. Any clarification, reassurance or further detail from the Minister would be greatly welcomed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> The Parliamentary-Under Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to be able to give the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) the assurances that he seeks and, through him, to be able to reassure the Royal College of Nursing.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was right to describe contracts as being essentially internal non-legally enforceable documents between health authorities, or between health authorities and hospitals. The patient must, of course, be interested in the outcome of the health care provided. Patients have a number of channels through which to express views about the quality of care provided.<br><br>
First a complaint should be made to the patient's DHA. It will be the responsibility of the DHA not to manage directly the hospitals that provide the service but to plan the health care needs of all the community. The DHA is answerable to residents in the sense that they should take up complaints with it.<br><br>
Secondly, if negligence occurs, it will be open to patients to pursue the matter directly with the DHAs and, if necessary, through the courts. Thirdly to answer my hon. Friends the Members for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), for Pembroke, (Mr. Bennett) and for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe). who rightly spoke of the importance of community health councils, it is important to take up issues of concern with the CHC, which should be an independent body—the voice of the patient.<br><br>
Fourthly, access to the Health Service Commissioner remains. We do not intend to make major changes to the role and responsibility of the commissioner or of the CHC. Given those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Jim Cousins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that patients may pursue a civil action for negligence through the courts. If a contract system is to be introduced, it is important to clarify who is responsible for defending such an action. The Minister's reply suggested that the burden of civil liability lay with the DHA that made the contract. I know from cases in my health authority and from the answer to a parliamentary question, that the burden of civil liability is rising rapidly, although the Department does not keep records of cases in which the liability established is less than £100,000. Will the liability lie in future with the DHA or with the provider?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press the amendment to a Division, but it is clear that NHS contracts will not be subject to usual contract law, although it is assumed that contracts between the private sector and the NHS will be subject to it. Will the Minister clarify the legal status of contracts?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister repeated his earlier comment on the importance of CHCs being independent. The CHCs are not as independent as they want to be because they are funded directly by the RHA. In some respects, they are looking over their shoulder at the source of their funds. We should examine the way in which CHCs are set up and funded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall reply to the question about civil suits for negligence. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health announced that DHAs would assume responsibility for acts of negligence by their medical staff from 1 January. That is welcome because it will assist the medical profession. DHAs will be sued for negligence because they have a statutory duty as the bodies responsible for directly managed units. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health will explain the position of NHS trusts, which is distinct from that of DHAs, under clauses 5, 6 and 7.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye asked about the private sector. A contract outwith the NHS will be legally enforceable.<br><br>
I mentioned the matter of the independence of CHCs in the debate on whether there should be representatives of CHCs on the DHAs and RHAs. The Government believe that that would compromise their independence. We propose no changes to the financing of CHCs, which cover the affairs of DHAs, and are funded by the RHAs. It is for the CHCs to discuss with each RHA the nature of their responsibilities and to argue the case for any change in their funding. It would be wrong for Ministers to intervene directly.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Keith Vaz <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that part of the confusion arises from the use of the word "contract"? He must realise that it is not a contract in the commercial sense. One cannot sue on it and it is not enforceable, so it is different from other commercial contracts in contract law which go back to the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company case. Hon. Members are legitimately confused, because there is also no privity of contract. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that this will cause confusion to those who wish to take up cases?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) is absolutely right. The person who wishes to sue may well feel that the person whom he or she should sue is the person who is performing his or her duties under the contract, rather than the legal entity which signed the contract. That will lead not to cases brought on the ground of negligence but to cases for judicial review, because they will inevitably end up with the Secretary of State, and the only people who will benefit from this will be the lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made it very plain on this and other amendments that we do not propose that the contract should be legally enforceable. It will be subject to arbitration, and amendments on that subject have been tabled. There is no confusion in the mind of the Government or Conservative Members, or of the Health Service, about the nature of the contracts. The contracts have two great advantages. First, they separate clearly the roles and responsibilities of the acquirers and providers of health care, and that goes to the root of the Bill. Secondly, of course, responsibilities are formally set out and targets are set for the delivery not only of the quantity but the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
quality of health care. Having said that, I hope that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye will not press his amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to labour the point, but this is an important example which goes to the heart of the purchaser-provider split; and let us be careful about what the Minister has just said. He implied that in the case of NHS trusts, the burden of civil liability will lie with the trust, but in the case of a contract placed with a hospital which is not an NHS trust, the burden of liability will still lie with the district health authority. That does not make sense.<br><br>
If the Minister really believes his own case about provider performance and the contract system producing efficiency, and if he really believes that the system should be accompanied by resources, he ought to believe that in the case of civil liability, responsibility for defending against negligence should lie with the provider.<br><br>
Only last Friday, I asked the official in my own regional health authority, Mr. Doran, who is responsible for precisely these matters, a direct question on this point, and he said, "the responsibility will lie with the provider." That contradicts entirely what the Minister has just said.<br><br>
If amongst the practitioners of the new system there can be such disagreement on such an important point, the Minister ought to reconsider the matter and let everyone, including those who will put the new system into force, know what they are talking about.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'> Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 223 relates to the position before a contract is finalised; amendment No. 230 to the position after it has been negotiated.<br><br>
If we look at clause 4(4) we shall find a mechanism that can be activated if another Health Service body feels that a contract being negotiated is not reasonable. However, the conditions that have to be fulfilled for such a reference are relatively narrow. They relate to the illegality of bargaining power between the provider and the purchaser. My amendment seeks to broaden the circumstances in which this reference to the Secretary of State can be made to include the circumstances in which an
<br><blockquote><p>"arrangement may not be in the public interest";</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0517">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
or in which
<br><blockquote><p>"sufficient regard has not been had by the prospective parties … to the interests of patients.</p></blockquote>
"It is important to probe a little to find out in what circumstances this reference might be made and determine whether it meets all the circumstances that might arise. For example, a provider and a purchaser can negotiate a contract which contains inadequate standards or, perhaps, has no system of quality monitoring. Those are both factors to which the Government pay high attention. At the moment, it will not be possible for a third party, another Health Service body which might be about to negotiate a similar contract, to intervene and refer the matter to the Secretary of State because the unsatisfactory nature of the contract is not related to an unequal bargaining position<br><br>
In the earlier years of the new regime, it is envisaged that most exciting arrangements will be validated. In other words, the contracts in the earlier years will simply reflect what happens now: existing referral patterns. At the moment perhaps there are cosy arrangements between providers and purchasers which should be examined and opened up. Unless one broadens clause 4(4) it will not be possible for a third party to intervene and question whether the right standards are being specified in the contract or whether adequate monitoring standards exist to ensure that patients' interests are met.<br><br>
Amendment No. 223 broadens the circumstances in which a reference to the Secretary of State can be made. I shall listen to what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say, but the amendment will reinforce confidence in the new regime by giving this additional power to refer a matter to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Amendment No. 230 relates to what happens to a contract when it is in force but goes wrong. If we look at the final lines of clause 4(3) we find that if there is a dispute in respect of an arrangement, or contract, either party can refer the matter to the Secretary of State for determination. But, as the Bill is drafted, it seems that the Secretary of State has no powers to intervene himself nor, indeed, does a third party have any powers to refer that dispute to the Secretary of State. A contract may be going disastrously wrong but neither of the two parties wants to refer the matter to the Secretary of State—perhaps it might cause embarrassment locally and they want to keep the matter quiet. We hope that that will not happen and, if it does, not very often. It is important, however, to give the Secretary of State the power to intervene in such circumstances. Further, because that dispute might not be brought to the Secretary of State's attention directly, it ought to be possible for another Health Service body to bring it to his attention.<br><br>
Amendment No. 230 seeks to allow the Secretary of State to intervene directly in such matters and to allow another Health Service body to draw his attention to them. If we are trying to build up confidence in the system of contracts, it is important to have this safety valve when things go wrong. There are circumstances in which the action that I have outlined might be necessary; for instance, when a contractor repeatedly breaks the major terms of a contract, such as the standard of service, and the acquiring Health Service body, for whatever reason, chooses not to intervene but to overlook it. It will then be appropriate for the Secretary of State to intervene.<br><br>
A further example is when a contract does not provide for proper supervision and complaints are made, perhaps
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
in the local press. It will then be appropriate for the Secretary of State to intervene to sort the matter out, to ensure that unscrupulous contractors are not abusing the Health Service and patients and hiding behind a clause of a poorly drafted contract in order to continue to do so. The amendment is, in a sense, a probing amendment in that I seek reassurance that the circumstances that I have described either will not happen or, if they happen, that there is some means of bringing them to the attention of the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I speak briefly to amendment No. 287, which stands in my name? It, too, is a probing amendment and its theme is much the same as that of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). My aim in seeking to delete the words
<br><blockquote><p>"and … direct that it be proceeded with"</p></blockquote>
is to discover why the Government want this power. In particular, I am anxious to know how, in certain circumstances, the Secretary of State would proceed against monopoly.<br><br>
I suspect that there are sensible reasons for having the power, because it would enable the Secretary of State to instruct or require health authorities to behave in a certain manner, not least when there is an absue of monopoly. It could be used to ensure the best services locally, or to prevent one side or another from taking advantage of its position. That is all very well as far as it goes; the problem is that the Secretary of State, with such a power, is able to make a mockery of local decision-making. There can be wholly justifiable reasons—no doubt with all-party support—for interventions by the Secretary of State against a health authority that was seen to be acting in a manner that was contrary to the public or consumer interest, but equally there can be other reasons, such as straightforward political bias or ideology, for his intervention, and that would be far from healthy. For example, in the runup to the general election, after the enactment of this legislation, the Government will want to demonstrate the glowing success of their new structure, in particular of the hospital trusts, and if a hospital trust is widely perceived to be failing in a certain part of the country, the Secretary of State may intervene and use this power to make a success of it, overruling the wishes and views of the local health authority.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give us some idea of the reasons that will lead the Government to intervene. It brings us back to the point of order that I raised earlier in our proceedings about the document which we have still not received from the Department of Health and which will touch on many of the issues involved. Had that document been available, it would probably not have been necessary for me to table the amendment, because I am sure that it says something about the Government's thinking. But as we do not yet have it, the Minister has a golden opportunity to give us a sneak preview. We shall listen with great interest, and I hope that it will then not be necessary to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment briefly on amendment No. 287, to which the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) has just spoken. He said that it might not have been necessary to table the amendment, and in that respect, at least, I agree with him. As I read the amendment, it would have an extraordinary effect: the Secretary of State would have an opportunity to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0518">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
specify the terms of a contract, for reasons which I think are entirely sensible and on which we shall await my right hon. and learned Friend's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), but under the amendment, it would be impossible for the Secretary of State, having specified the terms of the contract, to enforce it. I appreciate that that may not have been the intention but what has been presented as a probing amendment would appear to be a classic case of a one-bladed pair of scissors; the Secretary of State could specify whatever terms he liked, until he was blue in the face, but could do nothing about getting them implemented. We want the Bill to achieve their implementation.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Gentleman's generous remarks, I should say that it is a probing amendment for the simple reason that the Government have not yet told us their thoughts about intervening. The only way to flush out their reasoning is by tabling the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Perhaps I may draw the Committee's attention to the fact that, from 1 April 1991, we are changing the basis on which DHAs are funded. I have already explained that change to the Committee. At the same time, we shall move to a system of contracting. The change in the funding of DHAs means that they will be funded according to the number of residents in their catchment population. That will mean significant changes for certain districts, especially those that are large importers or exporters of patients from and to other DHAs. On 1 April 1991, contracting will begin for all districts.<br><br>
In previous sittings, the hon. Members for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) and for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked me about specimen contracts and our thoughts on openness of contracts. I confirm that we shall very soon publish model or specimen contracts. We shall draw on the experience of districts that have been working on what needs to go into a contract, such as how to prescribe the necessary quantity of services and how to require the necessary quality of services. As I said, we expect to make public very soon our thoughts on those contracts.<br><br>
Openness in contracts goes directly to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye. We have published a consultative document on that; we are seeking views and shall reach a conclusion about how far to go in terms of public accessibility to the contracts and to what extent hospitals, in agreeing to provide services, should be frank and open about their underlying costs. We have not yet reached our conclusions. No doubt the hon. Gentleman has read the document. His views and those of other organisations with which he may or may not be in contact would be helpful.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton tabled two helpful probing amendments. I hope that I can give him the complete satisfaction that he seeks. He divided his remarks into two parts. Amendment No. 223 relates to disagreements before a contract is concluded. It stands to reason that if there is basic disagreement or anxiety, in most instances the contract will not be concluded. In some circumstances, however, one of the providers—perhaps a large hospital—might have strong, almost monopoly,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
powers in the provision of services because there might be no other or only a limited choice available to the DHA in placing the contract for a specific service or range of services. If the DHA believes that there is an abuse of monopoly power by that provider, under clause 4(4)(a) or (b), it has the power to refer the matter, after conciliation by the RHA, to the Secretary of State for arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is, as you know, Dame Janet, some difficulty in hearing at this end of the room, but I have followed what my hon. Friend said with considerable encouragement. Will he confirm that I have the drift correct? Is he saying that the Secretary of State, on reference from a DHA, can operate as a kind of countervailing power against perhaps, say, the operation of a monopoly general hospital which is effectively controlling the acute health services of a district? I know that that concerns GPs in my constituency, and I am sure that that concern is reflected elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm what my hon. Friend says. The Secretary of State will be arbitrator in cases where there is an unequal division of power and where the district health authority seeking to place a contract believes that the hospital concerned—the potential provider—is seeking to abuse that position. I will deal later with what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said about the Secretary of State being co-active. He has a reactive responsibility when a matter is brought to his attention.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister for Health will deal in subsequent clauses with whether a hospital may become a National Health Service trust. One criterion which the Secretary of State must use is whether genuine alternatives are available to a district health authority. We would not wish to formalise a monopoly of power within a district health authority area or region.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton asked me about the problems arising after the contract is concluded. If it appears to a DHA—the acquirer of services—that the terms of a contract are not being fulfilled, after conciliation by the RHA, under clause 4(3) the DHA can refer the matter to the Secretary of State for arbitration.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right about the purpose of monitoring what hospitals are doing. I refer to remarks that I made during an earlier sitting about the 11 districts which are trying out a further delineation of their responsibilities in setting standards, drawing up contracts and understanding how they will be able to monitor the performance of hospitals. The flow of information from hospitals to the DHA is of great importance. Information technology has an important role to play, because the DHA must know quickly, with complete frankness between it and the hospital provider, what services have been provided, at what cost and within which time periods and what the quality of the service provided is.<br><br>
I believe that disputes about the performance of contracts will come to light naturally. The CHCs and the RHAs have a role to play in exposing any underperfor-mance or errors in compliance with the contracts placed, but the Secretary of State will ultimately be arbitrator.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton asked what will happen if the attention of the Secretary of State is drawn to the performance of contracts. My hon. Friend will recall that under clause 3(4) the Secretary of State has the power to intervene directly, although not in the sense of arbitration, but I think one must bear in mind that with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0519">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
contracting commencing on 1 April 1991, hundreds of contracts will be written—most of them block contracts, which are the formalisation of financial agreements between a DHA and the district general hospital—and it is neither practical nor sensible to expect my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health, even upon advice from his Department, to intervene in or review each individual contract. However, it is a reserve power, and I confirm to my hon. Friend that it exists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cousins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter, and to a degree we are swimming in treacle—indeed, a syrupy death probably awaits us all. I should like the Minister to confirm that what is meant by the contract system will be clarified to us before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least I do not dish out brimstone to the hon. Gentleman. I always try to respond clearly and rationally to amendments, and I take this one seriously. I try to do my level best to explain to the Committee the reasoning behind the Bill and treat amendments with the seriousness that they deserve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to hundreds of contracts and information technology. Could he tell the Committee what assessment the Department has made of the costs of introducing this technology where it relates to monitoring and billing? I think that the Committee is entitled to know what the financial implications are in those areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond briefly. A related subject has been raised that does not affect the amendment directly. We intend to commence contracting based upon existing information systems which were put in place on the recommendations of Edith Körner, who chaired a steering committee reviewing how information is produced and disseminated in the Health Service.<br><br>
The use of information technology, which is a separate matter, is related and important for two reasons. First, a minimum data must be set—namely, the minimum amount of data which a hospital will have to generate under contracting. It is necessary to know where the patient lives because we are funding the DHAs on the basis of residence. It must be known under which contract a patient will be cared for and one has to know the provider —the DHA that will provide the cost of the particular patient care, excluding, of course, accident and emergency provision.<br><br>
This and other information is largely available already in the hospital system. It must be pulled together, however, and the easiest way in which to do that is through information technology and the patient administration systems, which 90 per cent, of hospitals already have. We need to make further amendments to those systems for the DHAs, and I return to the important issue of monitoring which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton. The DHAs must also have immediate access to information about patient flows. They cannot rely on quarterly or half-yearly reports that are already out of date. They must have access to immediate information from the hospitals about when a patient is discharged, what service was provided and indeed, what the costs were.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not drag out discussion of the amendment, but there is much concern that the Bill will lead to the appointment of many thousands more administrators and much greater expenditure on information technology. Is the Minister assuring the Committee
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
that there will not be a gross, drastic increase in administrative needs or the appointment of hundreds or thousands of extra administrators, and that there will not be a need to invest in information technology in the way currently suggested by the DHAs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister for Health will be dealing with NHS trusts, but I shall make two general points. First, on financial staff, the National Association of Health Authorities in England and Wales estimates that the Health Service needs about 1,000 more financial staff, which is five per district, and it is not an unreasonable forecast. We have not made an official forecast, but that is the order of magnitude of staff that will need to be recruited—indeed, a start has already been made—between now and let us say the next two to three years, in order to improve the quality of financial management in the NHS.<br><br>
I do not believe that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) would disagree about the importance of improving the quality of NHS financial management. It is a gigantic enterprise—worth almost £30 billion and employing 1 million people, and it needs information technology to improve its quality. Information technology expenditure will be modest and will be financed centrally. We have announced £78 million for next year for the resource management initiative, which is entirely separate and not related to contracting. We have announced approximately £25 million for medical audit, which also is a separate initiative. The amount needed to ensure that contracts are monitored properly and that information on patient administration systems is collected properly is relatively modest and largely is already being spent by DHAs.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have spent several years listening to Ministers saying that the objective must be to reduce the number of administrators and the proportion of National Health Service expenditure spent on administration. The Bill increases drastically the number of NHS administrators, which is the reverse of what the Government have always professed to want. It is being done only for the purposes of billing and monitoring contracts. The Labour party opposes that, but the Conservatives are introducing it because they want, in effect, to privatise many parts of the NHS. Ministers appear to have done a complete somersault.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for his helpful response to my amendments.<br><br>
He gave me the assurance that I wanted on amendment No. 230. If a contract is going wrong locally and, for whatever reason, neither the purchaser nor the provider are prepared to refer the matter to the Secretary of State, it is possible for someone else to do so and, under powers in another clause, the Secretary of State can intervene. I am grateful for the assurance that I sought.<br><br>
I will press my hon. Friend a little on amendment No. 223, which relates to power to intervene before a contract is finalised. A DHA may be negotiating a contract with a hospital which, for some reason, declines to include in the contract items specified in page 17 of the working paper "Funding and Contracts for Hospital Services." The DHA may be minded to sign it although the contract omits some of the criteria that the Government consider important.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0520">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
Another DHA may be negotiating with the same hospital which is anxious to include the missing items. I understand that, at present, that cannot be referred to the Secretary of State because it has nothing to do with inequality of bargaining. Would my hon. Friend be happy for contracts which according to the Government's criteria, are unsatisfactory, to continue to be signed without the power of intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, it would be impracticable for the Secretary of State to continue to monitor, and to intervene in, each contract. Regional health authorities will play an important role in introducing contracts between districts DHAs and hospitals and in assessing and reviewing the development of the new contracting system. In some cases, RHAs will have views on the differences of provision in individual contracts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen McKay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have talked about financial provision. Will the Minister say whether the contracts will contain provisions on standards of care, and on protection and care?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The straight answer is yes. As we discussed at considerable length last week, the contracts must—and will—include requirements for standards of care. Contracts are about not simply quantity and cost of care but about quality. A requirement will be placed on the provider through the contracting mechanism to achieve a certain standard of care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is getting into an awful muddle with the use of the word "contract". Perhaps he can find another word, such as "agreement" or "guidelines". There is no point including in the contract words referring to quality if they are not enforceable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that the Minister treats amendments, from whatever quarter, with great seriousness. I have watched for a couple of weeks his masterly ability, in the nicest possible way, to bring a fog of incomprehension to bear on our proceedings. Sometimes it gets his Department off the hook. This morning there may have been another example of that ability, to which I pay tribute.<br><br>
I remain in need of reassurances which I suspect I shall not be given this morning. First, the balance of interest or advantage, whatever contracts, appeal systems or powers of intervention the Secretary of State will have, appears to rest largely with the provider, which will have the inherent advantage. As the Minister said, hundreds of contracts will be drawn up. Therefore, consumer interests will inevitably be disadvantaged.<br><br>
Secondly, when will the regulations which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) and I have mentioned several times be published? They are expected to contain further information about contracts and other matters. Are we likely to have the document by Report, assuming that the Bill makes the anticipated progress? We are all slightly shadow boxing without the full information on many matters that is essential to our consideration of the contract system, without which the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton knows in his heart that he cannot be entirely sanguine about ministerial responses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I heard the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) say that he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
thought that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health confused some of the issues. I do not agree. The confusion lies with many hon. Members who have tabled the amendments. They are still too conditioned by what they believed about the contract system when it was announced and have paid insufficient attention to my hon. Friend's clear explanations.<br><br>
I accept that the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) and the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye are extremely important. It is essential, when drawing up the terms of the contracts and resolving disputes about their contents, to ensure that the interests of the patient are protected above all else, that the quality of care is clearly specified and that the provider is required to deliver that quality. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has carefully taken us through the steps that will be taken to ensure that that happens.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said that it is plain to him that, in the drawing up of contracts, the interests of the provider—the hospital or unit that delivers the service—will be stronger than the interests of the purchaser, and behind the purchaser will come the GPs and patients. We shall return to that. I confess that I do not understand the basis of the hon. Gentleman's conclusion.<br><br>
The contract system is at the heart of the reform; we are discussing perhaps the most important clause in the National Health Service part of the Bill. Hon. Members must bear in mind the fact that the DHA, or the doctor's practice that holds its own funds, will hold all the funds, and will thus have the key role in deciding where public finance will be placed to develop services in the locality. First, they will have a duty to determine the needs of their resident population. They will judge them in a manner somewhat detached from the interests of providers. Secondly, having analysed those needs, they will decide how to apply the finance to obtain service of the required quantity and quality.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) that that is not akin to the ordinary negotiation of a contract. No health authority would choose the cheapest way to provide a service and ignore other considerations, as our critics imagine. Any district that did so would be held sharply to account. The district or the GPs and the providers will discuss the cost and pattern of their service and whether it will be provided from one or more sites. The service to chronically sick patients, for example, will be discussed. The contracts for a service involving collaboration between hospitals and the community services will be considered. For example, a contract for diabetic patients might stipulate a programme of preventive management. Such issues will eventually be incorporated into a document that might, as the hon. Member for Leicester, East, said, more properly be called an agreement which will specify the volume, nature and quality of the service and how it is delivered. The resources to be provided by the district and deployed by the provider will be agreed.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton asked what would happen if a contract fell short of what I envisage. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health rightly said that it would be impossible to set up a system under which thousands of contracts could be vetted by our officials. However, the regions will have a duty to

hold the districts and the FHSAs to account for their role. I expect the regions to ensure that a district will not omit clauses that others regard as necessary.<br><br>
The fears expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton should be allayed because the district will be held to account annually by the region, especially in the vital matter of contracts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The Secretary of State has allocated the responsibility for replying to the debate to a Minister. Is it the usual practice in a Standing Committee for the Secretary of State to second-guess that Minister and undermine his responsibility?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any hon. Member may speak, provided that he or she has caught my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. I intervened because of my steadily-growing interest in the debate. I have made speeches on contracts throughout our proceedings. The level of debate fell below the usual Committee standard only when the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) intervened and tried to reduce the debate to a knockabout on privatisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State was most helpful, and so was the Minister. But what will happen if, in spite of what my right hon. and learned Friend said, the DHA takes no notice of the RHA and signs a contract, although it knows that the RHA does not approve of it. The amendment would allow the RHA to refer the issue to the Secretary of State for arbitration. I ask my right hon. and learned Friend not to monitor every contract, but to allow bodies to refer contracts to him if they do not meet the standards that he set out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem created by a district health authority that was well below the expected standard of competence could arise under the present structure. In the last resort, a district is answerable to its region, which has the power to appoint the members of a DHA. The Secretary of State appoints only the chairman. The region decides the district management's performance-related pay.<br><br>
I do not suggest that a region should utter draconian threats to a district. In practice, through the system of accountability and review, their relationship should ensure that a good region can lean on a weaker DHA an raise its performance to that of the best.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
A district that refused to reconsider its contracts, and to raise its standards at the region's request, would put its position at risk. In that event the region and the Secretary of State would feel entitled to intervene.<br><br>
The broad brush of the clause as drafted is more realistic than the amendment, which would invite too-frequent intervention in individual contracts. That would not be a practical way of ensuring that the contract system is fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe (Mid-Kent)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) may have a point. When the system is set up, some speciality services will be in a monopoly because they are complex and difficult to provide. A more varied and imaginative service will evolve under the new contracts system than would have been possible in the NHS.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'> rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Secretary of State continues, I remind him and other members of the Committee that I prefer to see the front of the hon. Member who is speaking, not the back. I appreciate, however, the difficulties presented by the Committee Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for turning my back on the Chair, Dame Janet. I propose to have my hair cut when the Committee rises, and if I am in error in future and turn my back, my rear view will be improved.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) that a more imaginative approach to the provision of care will evolve under the contracts system. I am confident that the preparation of new contracts in 1991 will in most cases mean that those involved—the GPs, the DHAs, the hospitals and the units—will make financial arrangements to enable them to continue their existing pattern of care. That will apply not only in a constituency such as Ross, Cromarty and Skye, where choice is limited.<br><br>
Our requirement that contracts should be the universal norm in April 1991 for every unit—directly managed or self governing—will not be unduly disruptive. Drawing up contracts for the existing pattern of care will benefit those making local judgments.<br><br>
For the first time, districts and GPs will consider what they are doing and decide what they want to spend their money on and the providers will discover what they are expected to deliver. The GPs, especially, will be much closer to the pattern of care. They will therefore ask more questions about it than they have done in the past.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent that once the contracts are in place, the providers will consider ways in which a more sophisticated service could be provided and will push the district to pay for it.<br><br>
Districts and GPs, on the other hand, will consider alternatives and perhaps require changes to be made by the providers to achieve the standards of service offered elsewhere. When the system is underway, people will acquire information about what they are doing and use more imagination in considering how a service could be improved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I not correct in saying that at the moment local health authorities are required to consult local district advisory committees on the provision of services? Can my right hon. and learned Friend confirm that that will continue to happen when the Bill is enacted and that those committees will be consulted about drawing up contracts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I believe so. The fundamental change is that before districts enter into contracts they will need not only to consult GPs but to have considerable discussion with them about the pattern of service required. The districts will have to place these contracts to match the desired referral patterns of their GPs unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, and that already happens. Our advice to districts, which are now working hard on preparing for contracts, is that above all else they should now be well advanced in their discussions with GPs to discover what their present referral patterns are, why they have those referral patterns, what referral pattens the GPs want and their views on what they are getting and what they would like to have.<br><br>

At a gathering last night for all those preparing for NHS trusts, I sat next to a hospital unit general manager who made a revealing comment. He said that for the first time he was having more contact with GPs than he had ever had as the manager of a major hospital in London. He said that he was seeing all his GPs to learn what they wanted from his hospital because he wanted to ensure that they would not start moving their referrals, and therefore patient money, away from his hospital.<br><br>
He said also that he received feedback from the GPs he met, who knew more about some aspects of his hospital than he did because the GPs had feedback from patients, which the hospital did not. This general manager said that patients never complained about the hospital. If they were asked about their experiences in hospital, they all said that everything was marvellous. However, when patients saw their GPs they would say, "You know, I did not like the way that the senior registrar treated me. I was kept hanging around for hours." They complained about aspects of the hospital service to their GPs but not to the hospital. By the existing procedures that will continue, and with the new consultation with DHAs the contracts will have built in to them aspects of quality and consumer responsiveness which the existing arrangements do not have.<br><br>
I understand that the purpose of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton is to ensure that districts are prevented from falling short of our aspirations by taking substandard contracts. I hope that I have persuaded my hon. Friend that his mechanism is not very desirable and that the system is evolving now in the way that he desires. We expect the regions to ensure that districts and GPs specify the sort of things that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health and I have been talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting to hear the Secretary of State's intervention but, with all due generosity, we must conclude that the scenario he sketched was to say the least optimistic, if not rosy. Perhaps he should now leave the matter and simply agree that time will tell but I hae me doots.<br><br>
I do not think that Ministers are trying to avoid answering this question—they simply get sidetracked— but will the contract document be published before the Bill is on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I hope that the first specimen contracts will be available before the end of this month, and that districts will make many suggestions about how they can be improved. Copies of the specimen contracts will be given to Members of the Committee as soon as they are available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 229, in page 5, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Where, under an arrangement which is an NHS contract,
<ol>
<li>a person who receives services under that arrangement, must receive those services by attending at any place situated beyond the district of the District Health Authority of which he is an inhabitant; and</li>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
<li>the person incurs expense in travel to that place, the health service body which is the acquirer in that arrangement shall pay to that person a sum equivalent to his expenses in travel to that place.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 50, in page 5, line 41, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(9) Where any patient is to travel away from home to obtain services under a National Health Service contract the acquirer will pay the full cost of all the expenses.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 229 which is a probing amendment. Everyone who serves on the Committee will know that much concern has been aroused in the minds of the public about the possibility of having to travel long distances if the contract procedure is followed. In earlier debates, however, we heard that this was not an aspiration and that most important services will be provided locally. I hope the two amendments will provide the Government with the opportunity of reassuring people about their intentions in regard to long distance travel and will enable them to remind the Committee about the provisions that now exist to help people on low incomes to travel to hospitals and other health facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 50, which seeks to compensate patients when they have to travel outside their district areas for treatment. I take a different attitude to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), who seems to be reassured by the response last week from the Minister about patients travelling outside their district areas. The Minister accused me of scaremongering but in his response he confirmed my worst fears when he was unable to give any assurances on the core services contained in the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends. I am still of the opinion that patients who now have many services on their doorsteps at their district general hospitals may find that they will have to travel far and wide to receive exactly the same services.<br><br>
Opposition Members believe that patient mobility is the Bill's central message and that agreements will be made to provide services well beyond the areas in which patients live. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) gave examples of patients who might have to make 150 to 200 miles round trips, and the evidence already exists to prove that that will be a fact of life.<br><br>
The more we look at the position the Bill will create, the more we believe that it is effectively a busman's charter. The Bill will give a major boost to those in the transport industry because people will have to travel far and wide for services they previously had on their doorsteps. I am worried about that. The Government have not taken into account the inconvenience and major problems that patients and their relatives will face. Last week, I referred to the assumption of Conservative Members that everyone owns, or has access to, a car. Vast numbers of people, particularly people who are ill and the elderly who need to go to hospital themselves or to visit their relatives, do not have access to a car. They are supposed to depend on other means of transport such as taxis or public transport. I am worried about the cost to such people as a direct result of these measures.<br><br>
The Minister may again accuse me of scaremongering but people may have to look at their limited budgets and decide whether they visit a relative in hospital, have a meal or pay a bill. The Government have underestimated the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0523">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
extent of poverty and the problems that will be faced by low-income families as a direct result of the implications of the legislation.<br><br>
Further, the physical problems facing many elderly people in obtaining access to hospital treatment are major factors that we should bear in mind in considering the clause. Many elderly and handicapped people cannot use public transport. They cannot mount the steps on to buses or even get to bus stops. These are the people that we should be considering. They will be directly affected by the clause.<br><br>
I want also to make a plea on behalf of relatives. It is fair to say that the process of recovery for patients in hospital is assisted by relatives seeing them regularly. The love that people have for their families and friends is illustrated vividly when we see the queues of people entering hospitals every day to see those who are ill or undergoing courses of treatment.<br><br>
I am worried because the financial position of low-income families who may be receiving benefits is unsatisfactory now and the position will be worsened by the clause unless we accept amendments Nos. 50 and 229.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to give way. I am aware of the pressure of time, and want to make several limited and straightforward points before sitting down. The hon. Gentleman can, of course, make a contribution himself.<br><br>
The Government should examine Department of Social Security arrangements for people travelling to hospital for treatment or for relatives visiting patients in hospital. My experience leads me to believe that those arrangements are not adequate. Patients on income support, family credit or war pensions can obtain assistance with travel costs, but many others on low income cannot get a ha'penny towards such expenses. Relatives on income support can sometimes obtain assistance, or they can get a social fund loan, thereby getting themselves into debt to visit relatives in hospital.<br><br>
This is unsatisfactory. Under social security legislation, people living in the Stilly Isles or in an area covered by the Highlands and Islands development board who have to travel more than 30 miles on land or more than five miles by water qualify for assistance. Many people who now have access to treatment on their own doorstep will, under the Bill, have to travel far and wide for treatment. I enter a plea to the Government to respond to our constructive amendment, and to find alternatives, especially on the issue of social security assistance for patients and relatives of patients visiting hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) on amendment No. 15. Travel costs will be major under the provisions of the Bill, for reasons that have already been stated, but they are already a problem. Regional services are bad enough now when parents, for instance, have to travel to see their children in hospital. Last year my granddaughter had major heart surgery in Killingbeck, which, although many miles from Halifax, is the regional facility. I know what expenses were incurred by her parents, who were on a fairly low income. The Government make matters worse by refusing to include
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
paediatrics as a core service. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) moved an amendment about that last week.<br><br>
The problem was brought home to me because there is a proposal to close one of the children's wards in my constituency. It is a disgrace that children may now, if they are boarded out on a ward, have to share their facilities with adults, and may have to mix with terminally-ill and confused elderly patients. They could be frightened if they are on a ward with amputees; there are all sorts of implications. Furthermore, consultants might decide that they will not, for instance, have children needing ear, nose and throat treatment on a mixed ward, and might move them to Kirklees, Bradford or Burnley. If that happened, parents might have to take two or three buses to see their children.<br><br>
It is generally accepted that parents bringing up children are not well off, and there are many people in that category. Travel costs are a problem now, but the problem will grow. This is an important amendment, and I hope that the Minister will note our arguments, and look at the disgraceful proposal to close the children's ward in Halifax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for many moments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Each Committee member is entitled to have the floor when I have called him, and snide remarks are not helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Couchman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet.<br><br>
I understand the reasoning behind the amendments, but they ignore the fact that many people now travel outside their districts for treatment. In some areas in south London, up to 50 per cent, of treatment is given outside the district. The additional travelling costs involved in the amendment would add enormously to the burden of costs on the NHS, and would make the proposal impractical. Moreover the bureaucracy that would be necessary to repay patients' travelling expenses would be a great additional burden on already stretched district administrations. We have already heard the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) say that he does not welcome the new administration proposed by the Government for the Health Service.<br><br>
We should vote against the amendments on the grounds of additional bureaucratic burden and additional cost, and because they would add nothing of benefit to health care —as opposed to providing a social service, as the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) put it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our proposals for facilitating cross-district boundary treatment for certain patients is designed to bring Health Service care to them more quickly. The hon. Members for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) and for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) conclude that we propose to bus patients around the country. We do not; the Opposition have raised unnecessary fears. Our proposals for contracting are in part designed to help those who need elective surgery. They will enable resources to follow the patient who, upon the advice of his GP and with the concurrence of his local DHA, chooses to travel to another authority to have an operation done more quickly. The measure, and NHS contracts, will benefit patients waiting for such treatments as hip replacements, corneal grafts,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0524">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
and varicose vein operations. The hon. Member for Halifax is doing patients a great disservice by seeking to restrict the measure.<br><br>
I give the assurance that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) seeks. The NHS hospital travel cost scheme, the benefits of which are not widely known among patients and families, will not only remain but be publicised more widely. I hope that with that assurance, he will not press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is ludicrous of the Minister to ridicule the problems of travel as if they were either unimportant or unnecessary. They are extremely important, as the cost, the burden, the pain and the difficulty of travel for patients and their families are well known. The problems disturb many people, including Opposition Members.<br><br>
The Government should surely have evaluated the problems and the Bill's likely effect. The Minister implies that he has extra knowledge and that the proposals will not be detrimental to patients. I asked the Secretary of State for Wales in a parliamentary question what number and what proportion of patients in each Welsh county had to travel distances of over 10 miles, 20 miles and 30 miles to attend hospital out-patient clinics. The answer was that the information was not available centrally. There was no expression of concern or attempt to the evaluate the problem. The Government do not know or care. The Minister's dismissive reply was a scandal.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have said, clause 4 is crucial to the Government's Health Service reviews and to the Bill. Important features of the reviews, such as self-governing hospitals and fundholding for general practitioners, find their home in clause 4.<br><br>
In the amendments and the new clause we seek to provide a mechanism that guarantees quality. Like organisations such as the Royal College of Nursing, which has done a great deal of work on the amendments and the new clause, we are anxious about the way in which the Bill bypasses the need for quality. I do not want to repeat the arguments over contracts, but the Minister will probably respond by saying that quality will be a condition in his specimen contract, and that if it is not fulfilled, it will be up to either the DHA or the provider to say so.<br><br>
As was so ably exposed by my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) and for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), however, the contract is unenforceable. So there is no point in a clause on quality, since nobody can enforce it. The Minister may reply that the ultimate sanction to ensure quality is the termination of the contract. But what can be done if no other person is prepared to enter into a contract with a DHA? It worries us greatly that the Bill has been drafted without these guarantees.<br><br>
We seek to create the new post of director of patient services. An independent person working with a national inspectorate organised on local lines will be able to provide the assurances and safeguards to ensure quality in health care. Our aim in new clause 4 is that the director of patient services shall promote the highest standards of health care. We approach the Bill with the view that quality is the paramount consideration. The use of commercial legal terms such as "contracts" is not the best way to proceed on health care legislation. Their use necessarily leads to the flow of money. We are concerned with patients.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the Opposition's lines of attack on the Bill is that it increases bureaucracy and centralisation in the National Health Service. What is the hon. Gentleman proposing but more bureaucracy and centralisation, more inspection, more staff and greater costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Conservative Members could argue flippantly that the Opposition's proposals are in line with existing Government policy. If the hon. Gentleman were to read a copy of the Electricity Act 1989—I am sure he does every night: it is good bedtime reading—he would see that section 3 sets up an independent director who guarantees qualities of services.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0525">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
12.15 pm<br><br>
He might also look at sections 5 and 6 of the Water Act 1989, which is a weighty document that we do not support. Those sections set up a director general of water services, and a customer services committee which works with him. In other areas of legislation the Government have appointed independent people to examine ways of ensuring quality of services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not appreciate the difference between the Acts that he cited and this Bill. The former arranged for the sale of industries to the private sector, and set the standards that Parliament wished to impose on them. The whole point of this Bill is that the National Health Service will remain in the public sector, under the control of Ministers who are responsible to Parliament. We do not therefore need to appoint an officer to do the job that the hon. Gentleman outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What has the hon. Gentleman been doing in the back over there? To echo the point made by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young): perhaps he has indeed turned into a mushroom. If he had listened to our speeches and to the experiences that we related, he would have seen that we have good reason to believe that the legislation paves the way for the privatisation of the Health Service. That is why we, and organisations involved in health need to ensure a quality guarantee.<br><br>
Our director of patient services would ensure that the highest standards of health care were promoted. He or she would ensure that the best interests of patients were met. We should ensure that guidelines were issued by the director of patient services to provide information needed by local hospitals. It is also necessary to provide the resources for the director of patient services to perform his or her duties properly. We would therefore provide a paid staff and qualified inspectors to give assistance.<br><br>
The Government's view of the Bill is to say, "Never mind the quality, let's feel the budget." Our view is that an independent watchdog is vital to protect the consumer. I hope that the Secretary of State will not take the amendments personally, although they seek to remove him as the arbiter of disputes. I know that he has spent much time cultivating his image as the boy-next-door, beer-swilling Nottingham Forest supporter. To anyone else, he would be the ultimate person to decide such matters. But we believe that it is necessary to take these powers away from the Secretary of State. They should be placed firmly in the hands of someone with a wide range of powers, who will be able to deal with the standards and quality of care that are necessary in a modern health service.<br><br>
The models that have been used in every other major piece of Government legislation are clear, regardless of whether the legislation is for the privatisation of gas, water or electricity, or about telecommunications, or how the core curriculum will be administered through the Education Reform Act 1988. They all guarantee the independent service that is needed to check quality. All privatised measures make sure of that—except, of course, the measure to privatise the Health Service, which is implicit in the Bill.<br><br>
The onus of providing a good-quality service is to be placed on the providers in contracts that cannot be enforced. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) was right to raise this important aspect. If the quality of service is not established
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
in the specimen contracts, which have still not been published, what does the patient do when something goes wrong? Against whom does the patient take legal action? Does the patient look to the Secretary of State or to some other body for protection? Under the present system, to guarantee the quality that a patient would expect from a Health Service—if we accept the Government's model— the patient would have to take the DHA or whoever was providing the health care to court. It would be a lengthy mechanism to solve a simple problem.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health made great play of a recent MORI poll, which he says could be used to support his contention that people were prepared to travel. As he is so keen on opinion polls, may I refer him to another opinion poll, carried out by the Royal College of Nursing? It was published on 15 January 1990, and it showed that 80 per cent. of Conservative Members of Parliament wanted to strengthen the National Health Service and Community Care Bill by setting national standards in health care. It was not a MORI poll; it was carried out by the Market Access Political Opinion Panel, and some Conservative members of the Committee may have responded to its request for information. It reveals that
<br><blockquote><p>"70 per cent. of Conservative MPs would like to see an independent national inspectorate established to ensure that adequate safeguards of health care are provided by both state and private medicine."</p></blockquote>
The figures show the strength of that support.
<br><blockquote><p>"Of those asked whether they were sure that the present health reforms were adequate in view of the fact that there are no quality assurances given and how they would react to a proposal to set standards of health care at the national level in the NHS, a total of 80 per cent. of Conservative MPs either strongly supported or supported that view. Only 5 per cent. opposed that view. Of the Labour MPs, 60 per cent. strongly supported that view and 34 per cent. supported the view—a total of 94 per cent.—and only 3 per cent. opposed it."</p></blockquote>
The next question in the opinion poll concerns the establishment of a national independent inspectorate, exactly in line with what is proposed in amendments Nos. 294-7 and new clause 4. It can be seen from the responses that a total of 69 Conservative Members of Parliament either strongly supported or supported the view, that an independent national inspectorate should be appointed in order to guarantee quality in health care, and a total of 92 per cent. of Labour Members of Parliament either strongly supported or supported that view.<br><br>
Other surveys have been carried out recently. There was even one by the Liberal Democrats, which discovered that 94 per cent. of GPs thought that the quality of health care would diminish if a health inspectorate was not established, and it is clear from other surveys and newspaper articles in the past few weeks that that view is shared by others.<br><br>
We maintain that an independent, nationally trained inspectorate should be established, with its own jurisdiction, so that essential issues of quality can be examined. I know what the Minister will say in response; he will say, "We support quality in the Health Service. We believe that the specimen contracts can be used to set those broad criteria." If the Government believe that quality is important, what is their objection to the establishment of an independent inspectorate—an entity that is separate from the Secretary of State and can deal with these issues, using trained staff to ensure national standards?<br><br>
It comes down to this: do we really care enough for the consumers of the National Health Service to give them the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0526">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
guarantees that the amendments and the new clause would allow? I believe that we should care for the consumers. The overriding consideration in clause 4 should, in my view, be the guarantee of quality. I hope that the Minister will accept the reasonable amendments and new clause and at the same time the views of more than 70 per cent. of his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sims</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should make it clear at the start that I was not one of those who responded to the questionnaire from which the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) quoted, and I cannot of course speak for my colleagues, although I understand the anxiety about ensuring quality under the contract system. There is provision in the community care part of the Bill for independent inspection units—there may be reservations as to whether they will be adequate, but at least there will be that mechanism—but there is no equivalent provision in the NHS part of the Bill.<br><br>
I am not unsympathetic to the spirit of the amendment. I understand the anxiety of nurses, for example, who have a particular interest in it, because more than anyone else, they are involved in the provision and maintenance of quality of care. But I am not persuaded that new clause 4 provides the best answer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) said, it would involve an elaborate bureaucracy, and in my view it would be a form of restraint on those negotiating contracts, who would feel that big brother was looking over their shoulder.<br><br>
I am anxious to know more about the mechanisms that are likely to be used to keep people up to the mark. I shall quote from the NHS Review Working Paper (2), which says in paragraph 2.10:
<br><blockquote><p>"The contract should set out what services would be provided, how the hospital proposes to meet the standards for customer service … how the quality, efficiency and where possible the outcome of the services would be judged, including … the respective roles of authority or hospital in monitoring performance."</p></blockquote>
Later, in paragraph 2.20, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It will be the responsibility of those placing contracts to monitor the performance of hospitals, in providing agreed services."</p></blockquote>
So it appears that the monitoring is to be confined to the two parties of the contract.<br><br>
The idea of contracts within the Health Service is not new. There have been contracts in the past, for example, in cleaning and catering. There have, of course, been problems, but I think that most of them have been overcome. The operation has been very successful and has saved a great deal of money, which has been used for patient care. There is, therefore, every justification for pressing on with the idea of contracts.<br><br>
It is possible to monitor a contract for those services fairly easily. One can see a dirty floor and taste cold or unappetising food and know that the contract is not being complied with, but health care is more difficult. The patient can be involved and, in a sense, can do some monitoring, although he is not always in the best position so to do, as I recall from my own recent experience.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Perhaps there could be an enhanced role for CHCs. They have the advantage of being local and they could be more involved than they already are in the monitoring of services. But to do so, they would require more resources.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
I look forward to seeing the draft contract, which will fill in some of the details lacking on the issue. Meanwhile, will my hon. Friend the Minister tell us a little more about the Government's thoughts on the specific matters to which I referred?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments is vital to protect the quality of health care in a market system of health care. The Government are forcing an enormous risk on patients who use the NHS.<br><br>
Instead of local DHAs providing services from which general practitioners and patients can choose, DHA managers will negotiate contracts and the bulk-buying of services which the patients will have to use. There will be choice in the system, but it will be for those managers. We are worried, first, that patients and GPs will lose their choice and, secondly, about how managers will use their choice. They will be able to buy services from NHS trusts, contracts with their own locally managed hospitals, other districts and also private clinics. How will they choose? What will influence their decision about where to place the contract?<br><br>
The most important factor for the patient is outcome —whether he lives or dies, whether he recovers or gets worse, whether his treatment improves the quality of his life. That is what matters to him. Managers, however, are not recruited or trained to know about outcome and to assess quality. The managers who will place the contracts do not know about those aspects. They know—all the performance indicators and new technology will tell them —about cost. They know about throughput and turnover of patients; they know about the accountancy of health care. In choosing between the local hospital and a neighbouring private clinic, they will wonder how many hip replacements they can get for £20,000 or how many X-rays and tests they can get for £50,000. Managers will have a keen eye to cost because we know that they will be castigated if they overspend the budget given to them. We know also that they will be promoted if they cut the amount of money spent.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has presented us a complete fantasy about quality. It is all hope and illusion; there is not one bit of substance or one guarantee in it. Specimen contracts were mentioned. But they are merely that: specimens. Draft contracts are merely drafts. No guarantee about quality can be found in the clause or anywhere else in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read for a degree in management. I have never known anyone with qualifications in management who does not take outcome into account when judging whether the management of a service is correct. How on earth does the hon. Lady think that any manager would operate a system if, for example, when considering the cost of hip operations, he did not take into account whether those operations were successful or whether remedial work was necessary? That is part of good management. Plainly, the hon. Lady does not understand what management is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem of cost competition in health care is that it has precisely the opposite effect of cost competition in goods and services in the high street; we know that cost competition drives quality down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Lady did not go through life suggesting that everything in health care was quite different from anything else. I know
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0527">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
that the hon. Lady is concerned as we all are with safety and all aspects of transport, particularly in aviation, and anyone who suggests that British Airways at the highest level is not concerned about safety, care, the end result and all the things that matter does not understand what management is and what a successful company British Airways is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I through you, Dame Janet, indicate to Committee members that I do not plan to give way again, particularly to interventions as irrelevant as that. We know that cost competition drives down quality in health care. The lesson from America is clear. Research on the outcomes of non-profit making hospitals competing for patients shows that in order to win contracts for patients, they cut their costs, and when they did that, they cut corners, which in turn cost lives.<br><br>
The same research on the internal market showed that the safest place to be treated if one wanted to survive an operation and get better was where there was a monopoly provider, where the keynote amongst the doctors was co-operation rather than competition, and where they focused not on financial survival but on quality of care.<br><br>
The internal market will unleash in this country that pressure to drive down standards. We must have countervailing balances to protect the patient. That is not easy, because medical audit is in its infancy. We know that those who know most about outcome, who are the GPs who see the patient coming back from hospital and under courses of treatment, will be excluded from the decision. There is much nonsense talked about who will be consulted but the question is who will make the decision, and those who are in the best position to know about outcome will not be included in making it.<br><br>
I hope that the Secretary of State will make a commitment that the contract will be published, otherwise we will not know whether the Government have attempted to write quality into it. It is vital that quality is written into the contract. The internal market has been experimented on by the waiting list initiative, and the National Association of Health Authorities in England and Wales analysed that initiative. It reported:
<br><blockquote><p>"In general, health authority managers expressed satisfaction with the treatment received by their patients. However, only 6 per cent. of 'exporting' authorities explicitly tested patient satisfaction."</p></blockquote>
So all the managers said that they were satisfied, without any information on which to base their satisfaction. There should be no internal market until guarantees and safeguards are established, otherwise the risk for the patient is too great. The patient will risk losing choice and being sent where care is cheapest rather than best.<br><br>
The Government talk about efficiency and value for money, but what they really mean is cheapness. When they talk about efficiency, they are talking not about the outcome but about the price, and in health care cheapness is not necessary the best by any stretch of the imagination. Take the research being done on children with cancer. It is found that children with cancer are far more likely to survive if treated in an expensive regional paediatric oncology unit. If they were treated more cheaply in the district general hospital, certainly the treatment would be cheaper but the child would be more likely to die. Therefore, the question of quality must be uppermost. What matters to the patient is the outcome. The trouble is that what matters to the managers is cost.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady refer to a solitary part of a document or any statement made by a Minister about the documents on this NHS reform which implies that people will be given the cheapest care? Her whole argument is based on a completely and utterly wrong premise and bears no relationship to anything which has ever been put forward by a Conservative Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Harman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The entire Bill is about competition. DHAs have been cash-limited, and GPs' practice budgets, and indicative drug budgets, will be cash-limited. The entire Bill is about privatisation and cost-cutting, yet the Secretary of State has the cheek to tell the Committee that it is not about costs. Our amendments would at least put the outcome for the patient on to the agenda. Otherwise there will be only the powerful forces of cost-cutting and commercial pressure. All that the Secretary of State offers for the patient and for the preservation of quality is vague, illusory promises that mean nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the past five minutes we have heard only non sequiturs and nonsense. The whole purpose of our reforms is to introduce greater flexibility into the Health Service by separating the responsibilities of health authorities for planning for the care of those within—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get on with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the points that were raised by the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that hon. Members will already be aware that I deplore seated interventions. In this case it was singularly unhelpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The essence of the hon. Lady's argument is that cost competition will drive down quality. However, the reverse is the case, for two reasons. First, if DHAs have the flexibility to place contracts wherever is best for their patients, they will take into account not only the cost, but the quality of providing those services. We shall place on DHAs a clear responsibility for cost and quality.<br><br>
Secondly, choice in the system is exercised either directly by the patient, who can change GPs, of by a GP or DHA as a proxy for the patient. Where such choice exists, quality is always a vital part of the decision.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) was right to say that it would be wrong to introduce, as the amendments propose, a new, rigid bureaucracy with a new national inspection system. It would create, as my learned Friend said, bureaucracy and rigidity. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) was also right to place unambiguous responsibility under the Bill on the DHA, the RHA and the Secretary of State. The DHA will exercise key responsibilities for quality and care. The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) has not got her mind round that concept.<br><br>
I agree with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) about some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). The Government sympathise with some of those arguments, which reflect the views of the Royal College of Nursing of the United Kingdom and the National Association of Health Authorities in England and Wales. Such views have been helpful.<br><br>
The Government will reflect on how best to improve standards. We do not believe that it should be through a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0528">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>>
national inspectorate, or through a national accreditation scheme. However, there are ways to improve the service, for example by a national advisory committee. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will reflect on and bring forward proposals for such improvement. The health advisory service advises on the quality of care provided to the mentally ill and the elderly. Its work with the mentally ill is under review. It could provide a useful model for advising DHAs, and hospitals with which they have contracts, about standards of care.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take in good faith what the Minister has said about reflecting on the amendments. However, we are anxious to ensure that patients can enforce their rights and get the best quality care available. Government policy is that quality will be written into the draft or specimen contract. How will the patient enforce a quality clause in a contract that is unenforceable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I have answered that point. I was addressing the other points that the hon. Gentleman helpfully made, which were reflected in submissions from the Royal College of Nursing about quality. I have dealt with the enforceability of contracts, I hope to the Committee's satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he would advise RHAs and DHAs on quality. I have a letter from the chairman of the Yorkshire RHA, Sir Bryan Askew, to my DHA. The letter, of about 500 words, deals with the authority's review of its health services. There are 22 references to deficits, costs, cuts, rationalisation, cost containments, reductions and other euphemisms for cuts. Patients and the quality of care are not mentioned once. If we have that now, what on earth shall we have once the Bill has been passed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that RHAs and DHAs have an obligation to provide care within the resources allocated. Unlike indicative drug budgets, which have been wrongly referred to as cash-limited, hospital services are cash-limited. Indeed, a Labour Government introduced the concept of cash-limiting hospital services.<br><br>
The professions also have a responsibility for setting standards. I admire what the Royal College of Nursing is doing, partly with Department of Health funding, to draft standards of care for nurses—not only mental handicap nurses and mental illness nurses, but others. Our proposals for medical audit are ways of setting standards of care within hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that choice would lead to an increase in quality. I have a document here produced by the national audit office of America, the GAO, which is independent of the Administration. It examined health provision in America and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The General Accounting Office believes that the closer financial incentives are linked to decisions about individual patients, the greater the potential threat to quality of care."</p></blockquote>
That examination was done by an organisation of the stature of the National Audit Office in this country, and it challenges what the Minister says. I have bags more information on the same point if the Minister is interested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Freeman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman draws inappropriate parallels between the United States and the United
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
Kingdom. We do not propose to move to the American system in which the patients use cash to determine the supply of health care.<br><br>
I conclude by referring to an announcement made today by my hon. Friend the Minister for Health which underlines the Government's commitment to improving the high standards in the National Health Service. My hon. Friend announced a further £10 million for various quality initiatives—£2-5 million will be dispersed through the Department of Health and £7.5 million through the RHAs. That money will help to improve the quality of accident, emergency and out-patient facilities and to train nursing and professional staff in the importance of quality and in improving the quality of services delivered. Following initiatives taken last year, this is another example that exemplifies and underlines our commitment to quality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to several of the Minister's comments, but first I wish to tell the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), who served with me on the Children Bill, that I am astonished that he is not prepared to have a big brother or big sister organisation to examine the quality of health care. On the Children Bill, he was prepared to accept a big brother or big sister to oversee the quality of children's care in respect of the powers of directors of social services and social workers. Surely the quality of health services that people expect under the NHS should be treated in exactly the same way as the quality of care for children. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman took the view that he did.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State for Health did not answer the question that I and many other hon. Members asked about the quality clause in the contract. If the Minister needs legal advice on this, he can speak to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health. But a quality clause cannot be enforced in a contract that is unenforceable. As the Secretary of State will know—he is a distinguished Queen's Counsel—in the general law of contract, dating back to the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company case, a contract means rights and responsibilities.<br><br>
The notes on clauses in the glossy pink document prepared by the Department of Health clearly say, in describing clause 4, that these contracts are different. That means that, in health care, the law of contract is being rewritten, these contracts will not give rise to rights and responsibilities and so cannot be enforced. There is no way of enforcing the quality clause in a contract that cannot be enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, not least because he is a lawyer and I am not. But there is an analogy in trade union or labour law in this respect. Surely in those contexts it is possible for employers and employees to conclude contracts which may, in certain cases, be overturned by industrial action without necessarily giving rise to private litigation. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that such practice is also undesirable and, if so, does he want to produce a legally binding agreement for all kinds of labour law, too?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, the ultimate recourse is to the law. Parties can be taken to the High Court to obtain the sequestration of assets, and so on. But that does not apply in this instance.<br><br>
The Minister said that he has considered the amendments and has great respect for the Royal College of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1989-1990V003P0I0529">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
Nursing, as we all do. He is prepared to set up advisory boards: organisations or committees that will advise. But our concern is about rights. Consumers should be given the rights to ensure that the quality of health care is of a proper standard. The NHS exists not for Ministers, Members of Parliament or managers of hospitals but for the consumers, the people who go to the Health Service to be properly cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that it is not intended that those contracts, as we call them, should be subject to litigation in courts of law. I assume that the hon. Gentleman would not wish them to be so. I trust that no member of the Committee seriously contemplates different parts of the NHS commencing legal actions against other parts to enforce the terms of a contract. That would be a lawyer's charter and paradise, but of little benefit to patients. It is intended that the contracts be binding inside the Health Service and be adhered to by the parties. A system of arbitration is proposed to ensure that that happens, and a unit that provides the services will not be paid for them unless it provides what is stipulated. We seek merely to ensure that those arguments are not taken to the law courts at needless expense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is creating a lawyer's charter. As contracts will not be enforceable and the matter cannot go to court, the Secretary of State will be taken to the High Court for judicial review. His decision as an arbiter will have been challenged and that will give rise to further litigation. We are against the nature of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
contracts. We do not want them to be enforceable. It is the Secretary of State's contract, but we prefer that there be no contracts. The contracts provision in the Bill does not provide the guarantees of quality that we want. Therefore we shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
